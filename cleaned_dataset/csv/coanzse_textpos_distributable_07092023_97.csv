I think you're welcome thank you and we have um ansfield anderson welcome kia ora thank you for taking the time from your busy schedule to listen to the views of your residence from the christchurch city council's own survey on climate change nearly 80 percent of respondents view the issue as extremely important it's great that as a city you have set the target of becoming net carbon neutral by 2045 however this is not compatible with an airport expansion firstly it is sad to hear that our airport wants to expand their operating hours in a climate emergency this should not be allowed christchurch international airport should have a sinking lid on its emissions they should not be allowed to grow their emissions when everyone else is reducing this secondly it is complete madness that our airport company is not just thinking about but has actually bought land and is now currently surveying said land for the construction of a brand new international airport this is shocking behaviour and very misleading when on your website it has many very nice feel good stories about making even factoring the airport into your projected emissions on your website you say this is our first long-term plan to include a climate change lens over everything does this include the airport on your website you say climate change is the biggest challenge of our time how can you say these words and with the next breath claim that these are not your emissions when you own the company crikey it's called christchurch international airport it's in christchurch it's owned by christchurch city council the facts are simple christchurch international airport is 75 owned by christchurch city council building a new international airport is not compatible with the climate and ecological emergency that you have declared I call on you the christchurch city council to stop terrorist international airport now thank you thank you it's um time for your presentation um completed so thank you very much okay is um pat mcintosh well it seems that um our last admission hasn't um
So anna and neil youngman welcome oh good afternoon and thank you for having us um this is our submission I think most of you have read it but I'll just quickly go through it we feel our rate should be reduced if anything because we have endured toxic killer dust expelled from shingle quarries in yolthurst for a number of years ccc ignoring scientific evidence that there should be a setback distance now even third world countries have a setback distance from quarries to residents as you all know possibly my husband and myself are embarrassed to be residents of christchurch known as the garden city with little transparency shown rural residents should not be expected to pay towards drainage issues we have already invested significantly in our own drainage the service we receive is a rubbish collection we provide all our own water supply and maintain our own wells pipes etc we feel there is no transparency on how the ratepayers money is spent decisions are already made before any submissions are heard at times and I feel that within the council amongst the councillors there should any affiliation with quarries and construction etc should not be in existence I would like to see the councillors that are setting the rate rates in the next 10 years have qualifications in business or finance or both hopefully both because I think there are far too many people making decisions that haven't got the qualifications and quite honestly as we all know it's very easy to spend other people's meaning the rate payers money I think the conflict of interest is a big one though and I think that if we could stop that within the council we would be very happy there should be no affiliation with any type of construction whatever quarries because they've got deep pockets it doesn't matter about the residents and we on the old west coast road differ we feel that we are important well and and I i do and I want to thank you also for making a submission and I do want to say to you that we've heard a number of submissions today end yesterday in relation to the the land drainage issue term plan and obviously we're going to listen to those submissions we're taking all of that into account when we make a final decision on the ltp I i do want to correct one thing around the quarries because it has been a source of great frustration to me we sat around this table when we were doing the replacement district plan which as you know went to an independent hearings panel that essentially was appointed by central government we said we wanted a setback for between residential and quarries we couldn't get it so we tried we absolutely tried our best to get it but in the end of the day we even we even produced expert evidence to present evidence in front of the independent hearings panel the independent hearings panel preferred the evidence of others so I'm afraid we weren't successful in that regard but I just want to reassure you that I don't think there's a counselor around this table doesn't believe there ought to be a decent buffer between quarrying and residential so I just wanted to I ask why won't you listen to I mean whether it comes from central government no it's a local it's an expert process under the resource management act we did our best we were unsuccessful and I'm I'm sorry that that is the case but I'd rather that you know that we were unsuccessful but when you did try we did try we did try so I see well as long as there's no conflict of interest amongst the councillors I i just can't see how that can be see well talked about as transparency when they are affiliated every every single councillor has to declare conflicts of interest when we have them and and all of our councillors know what the requirements are and they declare interests when they hold them so um and they are managed appropriately under our standing orders so that's all I can say to you thank you but uh but thank you very much for making your submission and uh I hope that you will find that we are very much listening and nothing has you very much thank you thank you philippa watson
Submission thank you uh and I've I overlooked derek roberts roberson robertson is it so I do apologize please come forward um because your submission was out of sequence I was looking at my agenda rather than at the names on the submission so I do apologize apologies accepted thank you come forward I'm speaking uh in favor of retention of the warrineri pool in my opinion enrichment of community living to provide cohesion for all age groups is the key to a successful city particularly in a world nowadays where people in all countries are striving for an identity a stability and a meaning to their lives by closing waranui swimming pool and its gymnasium and other localized amenities the people who live nearby are lost for a meaning to their lives I'm thinking of the substantial health benefits many many kiwis derive from team and solo participation in swimming exercise and the side sports of canoeing life saving etc it is all very well to say there will be a metro sports centre this can be too far away from people's homes and increasingly is very short-sighted for my part at age 81 and living in maryvale I have swum at warren area on a regular basis since 1980 over 40 years and would like to continue to do so transport to warren area by private car is easy for me but for many others to go into the city for a swim will not occur the guts will be ripped out of the ricketin area leaving young people with nowhere to go and worse still nothing to do except hang out in the shopping malls and for what it makes no sense to close warrenery when the council is building or proposing to build additional pools including a pool in hornby costing many millions of dollars many areas of christchurch want new pools all will cost a lot of money expensive to run and a constant drain on the ratepayer why close warrenery when its amenities are so widely used by nearby schools for water confidence and swimming lessons water polo triathletes surf lifesavers para swimmers master swimmers exercise groups of all ages and kayak groups I read that morinui has taught 200 swimmers and water polo players who have represented new zealand overseas all this must count for something surely please leave the pool alone thank you madam chair thank you very much and that's a perfectly timed submission as well very timely indeed thank you the next one is jim turpin thank you I think I know you I swam he swam with my wife in 1980 remember yesterday yeah and uh but I've been swimming there since about the 1950s or the 1960s my wife was on the committee yes she was with you that's right yeah my darling um good on you I actually you being witness to this on my closing bit what does that say save the waranui poll by now I'm saying it at the beginning that's awesome that's awesome it is what the class is about that would have to be the best demonstration of what the presentations have been about this morning than I've seen so well done see you
Urban star watch christchurch everyone I just got this slot sort of at the last minute before I went away so I'm I wouldn't say I was over prepared but I'm just going to speak to my submission in general um urban star watch formerly known as the red zone dark sky park and that's kind of where our focus is in the oak um we kind of missed an opportunity when we were doing the refit for the whole city we put in these I mean admittedly they are shielded and they're doing the sort of right thing like that but they are still these bright lights like like a prison yard but we haven't yet messed up the red zone and so when we are looking at um developing that area which of course we are um this is where the governance comes in so if we don't have a robust governance at the top saying right now this is how we're going to do infrastructure this is how we're going to do our lighting we want it to work if every individual project is just going oh how we going to like this so what are we going to do you know um so so the governance is a huge part of that um but also just the opportunity to um create that dark sky area that we're seeing all around the world I've just last night got back from great barrier island which is um which is now a dark sky reserve amazing and people go there for that reason they go to tekapo for that reason they kaikoura is looking at um doing dark sky lighting ones looking at dark sky lighting I've been talking a lot over the last few days you can tell and um christchurch is lagging behind you know why are we not jumping on this opportunity particularly we're looking at the river corridor which is an ecologically sensitive area where we're going to be regenerating forests we're going to be trying to bring back species it's a golden opportunity for christchurch to get on you don't get on the first step anyway I i I just want to um I don't really want to talk a whole lot because every time I come and talk about darts guys I fill up the time and no one gets an opportunity to ask anything but um but yeah I just don't want us to to miss out on this so if anybody does have a question let me know otherwise could keep rabbiting on yani have you looked at dunedin because what we what we were told was ndta won't allow us to go lower than 4 000. but there's other parts of new zealand that seems that have done that that's right so it so yeah for their main state highways they are still looking at the um I think you can go as low as 3 000 actually in urban areas you can go as low as 3 000 um so that's what dunedin did they they went as low as they could go it's still not um and the ida has just changed the accreditation so dark sky now I think you can't have remember which it is but but it's different when you're in um a park area and they've they've just put out a new designation of an urban dart sky park which is exactly what the oak could be it's big enough um and and and it's there's no traffic you know going through there so so that would be acceptable to go down to 2200 which is ideally what we want to do um sarah thanks tanya and you see us putting um rules in place rather than just guidelines so that the entire area is covered with any new project as well as the council stuff 100 I mean yes yeah that would be great yeah so I mean the the governance is is key and I know that it's uh that we're still looking at a long-term thing but I just want to make sure that those things are in there the lighting included and I don't want lighting to be the afterthought I think the the guy from palmerston north uh council said it quite well uh my submission somewhere which I can't find but oh here we go yeah we're excited to show our residents and visitors that lighting doesn't have to be an afterthought these paths show lighting can be innovative environmentally friendly tell stories of the history and I have a strong suspicion these will become an iconic shot of palmy as everyone realizes that they make the perfect backdrop for selfie notice so I mean you know we should be just grabbing this with both hands from my from my perspective anybody else anyone else too easy everyone on board loving it can we send her the memo thank you very much you're welcome thank you and we have from antsfield
All of these working yeah cool uh tina tina uh um I've lived in christchurch for more than a decade now and call it my home I'm also a rate payer and I just wanted to speak to one of the issues in my submission given the short time frame which is to reiterate my concern and shock at the possible closure of the richton bus lounge and I suppose I have a bit of a personal connection to this I was a part of a group that did a lot of public campaigning and rallying of community support for these bus landers to actually be built and I remember years ago now that the council went through several iterations of trying to find a site for these lounges and at one point it was I think we were talking about maybe the car park near um ricketton mall and then there was a bunch of other sites proposed and it sort of just kept getting you know uh shelved and and um the plans changed but when it finally went ahead or at least was proposed to um we were really stoked and we did a lot of rallying of the community especially in richton to actually pull together and say yes this is a great idea um and so after all of that to now sort of hear that it's proposed to being closed down um I just wanted to really yeah say that I think that's the wrong decision and I'm also concerned that the people that use this lounge um haven't_''_97.6 been consulted that's just based on an article I read during the long-term plan consultation process but yeah I just think that in this day and age given the climate emergency we're in the fact that climate was you know recognized front and center in the in the council's long-term planned consultation document which was great to see but decisions like this I suppose just make me wonder if you know it's all just talk because public and active transport is such a key part of reducing emissions in christchurch and I think we should be building more of these facilities to really show that shutting them down so as a rate payer I would be more than happy for my um for my rates to be you know spent on this kind of thing and um yeah I guess that's all I wanted to say really I'm happy to take questions about that or anything else that was in my submission thank you thank you I think somebody else made a submission where they suggested that it would have been better to have a notice specifically in the in the bus um lounge themselves so drawing attention to it so that people could um be aware of the of the process of the submissions do you think that would have been helpful yeah I think it would have been because I think I do remember reading that people who were waiting at the lounge were asked possibly by a journalist I'm not sure um you know whether they knew about the proposal and they weren't aware and um given how small it was the you know the notice in the long-term plan consultation document like I can't remember what little line and I don't think that was enough to notify the community of interest so very good look thank you very much thank you for making the time to come in and present to us thank you um
Hi um so yes I'm michelle clark I'm here to speak on behalf of the old hearst community there's some familiar faces around the table so I'm here to speak about the same thing that I hear about last time um but I guess the biggest thing for me is the oldhurst um hall is up for sale and disposal which is extremely disappointing after the support that we got the last time that we were here um so my purpose is to obviously preserve the memorial as it stands but also ensure that the hall is open to the community and it's utilized I don't want it to be sold ultimately but the biggest thing I'd like is for it to be maintained and respected as it should be um because I've previously presented and I attached my presentation to the um hopefully people have read it I don't see the point in going over that again we'll leave some time for questions but I think the big thing for me is obviously the hall was a gift from the time uh and the local community fundraised and also gifted the land it had as part of the condition needs to go to a local authority and that's what how it ended up with the council but ultimately it was the community that did this as part of the government structure at the time and the purpose of the hall I think is that actually the hall is the memorial and we forget that sometimes we talk about the plaques so it needs to be something vitally living something from the very nature of its use and enjoyment will ever keep before us and the generations that follow us the freedom of life and personal expression for which our men and women fought and fell the type of memorial which best embodies this is ideal for the community centre whether people can gather for social educational cultural and recreational purposes I can say that our support for the people that fought for our country hasn't changed and they neither have the needs of the community we still need this facility and actually we're getting less and thing that I presented earlier it has all of the needs of the community so I won't revisit it but happy to take some questions um since that time obviously the uh hall was up for demolition and we've been able to meet with uh different members of the council and show um an engineering report that will actually show that the the hall itself is up to building code now that came under dispute uh we then met with the council again and they agreed that our engineer could redo the report based on the connect working with the council and what that looks like that's almost finalized I would say I appreciate there's a time delay sometimes but we've almost finalized that but you've seen the initial findings that ultimately say that the building is good to go we just need to get it peer reviewed so what am I asking is please don't sell it please um just get it whether tight as it needs to please support us restoring it and allow our community health facility oh yes it sorry I missed that yep jimmy paul's update status my understanding the staff council star have you know working together with local community board and also the your group you know have a service to have a further discussion am I right yes regarding particular one is a partnership one the other one is apply for kind of even now you know it's a heritage building facility but still need to you know to amendments through those uh digital plan this stream review so I just want to know based on last discussion was update status so the last discussion we had so the last discussion was when there was an agreement that the um we would underwrite personally to have the engineer do the work because there was a challenge between going to council to have another engineers report um because the opus report was based on old information so the latest status is that you've got the interim report which we got through I think last week that shows that the engineer needs to get it peer reviewed but ultimately that it is at building um submission you state that the council has the keys they took it from the community and so how do you get access with the engineer so the engineer works with the council so we have to go pick up the keys and get it back but but remembering the engineer's already done all of the initial reports so when he was doing the other reports it was just a follow-up question if the memorial hall is given back to or given to the community you're all set up to run it as and you've you can have a committee structure and try and support the function the running yeah look absolutely look the thing I would say is we're fully behind that um it's been 10 years and so one of the things is we've gone out multiple times with business plans but as you can imagine they're like the mums and bubs group that we went out that were fully on board those kids are now at school so um each time we go out to create a business plan you and governance but yes yes we do yeah uh yani thank you can I can I just understand when you first found out that the building was for sale yes when did you know that the building was for sale um when I got a text from um one of our community members that told me that it had been um added to the plan right so no no one's talked with you even though you're working with our staff no one said no so I would say that an email came through when I uh went back to the um I guess the uh the landlord of the building and was concerned that it had been up for disposal he had mentioned he said that he had mentioned the fact that obviously the hall was part of the plan but I would say I wouldn't have called it great engagement right and did do you know just like did the community board were the community board aware that it was being sold no so when I contacted well I don't know at that point and of the community board we've been working with were extremely supportive they also attended that other meeting they um said please do turn up and put a submission in and then obviously they'd also put one in to restore the hall remember there's a question for our staff but I thought community boards you know what to do so just submit the question that's fine because we don't want to hold up people's time in terms of the submissions that we're going through so thank you very much for your submission very helpful thank you pet macintosh no rosalie jenkins
And mike welcome um this is mike norris the chairman of the akaroa civic trust and our submissions overlap so if you don't mind I will start with just a brief overview of a few images if I can uh you can run them all together if you like yeah okay we'll start with this one thank you um I'm not sure how to actually start that time or until very pretty okay um it's not on the right view but okay we're here today actually to talk about largely the acura service center and uh the building has been a focal point for the community uh since 1915 and within the christchurch area there are 12 community board 12 service centers 7 in the cbd in close proximity yet the one that you want to close is the most distant and remote along with littleton there's a lot of history behind our service center which was shut due to earthquakes um damage and repairs our staff worked in a portacom and then a temporary office and we were consulted about where we wanted that the property team decided they could sell but we said no you actually have to consult so 95 93 of the um ratepayers said they wanted it permanently reinstated in the post office building so the council spent nearly a million dollars to totally refurbish the building which opened in 2018 with two part-time staff and consistent opening hours but without consulting the community board the council closed the building on the 5th of january 2021 and they moved the facility a little desk and a computer into our school and community library and a trained librarian has now had to take over a secondary role as being the customer service representative and the hours vary depending on your source this is our new service center which is the white part of the building to the right the service center consists of the desk and the computer on the right-hand side unlike holswell uh librarians in holeswell do not have to man the service center desk nor do they have to do the accounting and banking on behalf of christchurch city council but yet in acaroa our librarian is beckenham that we can only dream about in acuroa there are ample meeting rooms public programs and a range of activities we have none of that this is our library in acura you see one small table for council information and for a heavier say documentation reference material is stored under the desk and most of it remains in the post office building which is not open to the public because there's simply no room to display it this is our staff tea room lunch area which might be sacrificed to form a private meeting room this is the children's student reading area which may be turned into a virtual meeting space the entire space of the library is 150 square meters but as you can see it is well used during peak season this was a few years ago prior to covet 19 the library is on school land and is in a former gym which has been converted into a cinema on one side and the library on the other you cannot compare the acaroe library to any of the other facilities that you have in it accommodates the school and the community as a core library we don't have flat screen tvs we don't have massive computers and students actually have to wait in line when it gets really busy our librarian has had minimal training and actually has been so stressed out she had to take leave I spoke to representatives following a computed community board meeting back in march and was told the service center would never move back into the post office building but I really thought that was a decision made by elected representatives uh it was also suggested that the library 150 180 square meters could move into a 42 square meter space in the old post office and I had to point out it probably was not a good idea because the school is located directly next to the school library and it's also a junior and primary school and that gives you an idea of the location of our old service center post office building which we regard as the cbd and the location of the citizens desk and hub at the school library uh yellow area was occupied by our former service center staff and I can go on further but I think mike I'll turn it over to mike on behalf of the acura civic trust we'll be happy to answer questions and there's several more slides if you would like to go back and review it at your leisure all of this has taken place to save 56 000 per year and in my view it's contrary to your strategic framework and all of the policies that you have sent out regarding resilience and strengthening communities but mike will follow up thank you madam mayor deputy mayor councillors how much time do we have because it started off at five and I believe okay I'll have three so can we reset the clock please I'm concerned um you'll realize that the number of submissions is larger than usual I think it's probably because you've poked the bear I think if um a decision is made to close the service center and then implement it in the way it was there's going to said that achara is the jewel in canterbury's crown and we'd agree with you but it's an expensive jewel we know we take out more than we contribute in rates but that's a fact of life where a rural community I think today I'd like to hope that we could have a vision instead of discussing a matter of saving 57 000 by one staff member not being retained how about a vision which would incorporate a proper use for the old post office building it could be the hub of the town not just the service center but it could be an information center run by the city council as in most other new zealand towns it could be an information center that would promote acura not be driven as the current eyesight is by commission selling it could promote accurate with posters and with other material to perhaps take advantage of the new eco-tourism and the heritage tourism that we can anticipate when takapuneki and that wonderful scheme comes on some of us have been working behind the scenes to encourage the bnz atm machine and those discussions are underway I congratulate the council's head of facilities and his team on being very receptive to the bnz's needs we could also look at new zealand post I know they're reluctant to stay in accordance we're told that by one of your staffers but we need to persuade them and relocate those rusting red po boxes from the wreck ground where they currently are and as for moving the library uh dawn will know this from her experience in birmingham which has got europe's finest and most expensive new library libraries are now seen as the cathedrals of the new economy and I think to tamper with our library and try and cram it into a smaller space just goes against the grain of what we should be trying to do if we could have a destination management strategy not composed by christchurch new zealand but by akaroa strategists we could have a new dawn for akara I would say don't cut I know you've had the need for budget cuts and that's been forced upon of 19 million perhaps it's time to restore some of the things that you've wanted to cut and a new dawn for achara finally I think to make a decision as was done on transactional based activity shows a lack of understanding of what a service centre was there to do jeff carter the outgoing service center manager was much more than a transactions person he was the face of the council in nicaragua currently we don't have one please can we change that uh could we add that we support the rapiers association the submission by harry strong absolutely and especially the friends of the aquarium museum that is a core facility for our community and for all of banks peninsula and for the wider canterbury region they need to be open as they are and that budget should not be reduced thank you very much I think um it's been very helpful to to actually hear a number of the submissions in in a in such close proximity to each other because it does raise that issue of whether a more um sort range of issues it's it's you need to take a holistic approach and acoroa is unique we are remote we are isolated and carrie little will be speaking to you in about 30 minutes from heartland she deals with another area of acura that is very important and needs to be heard thank you thank you very much thank you thank you um is saddam mckinnon available yesterday he's on on the line so we'll go to sir don mckinnon hello sidon welcome by zoom the
I live in accora and I'm managing coordinator at upright heartlands hearts in the ministry of social development initiative providing geo and ngo services on the peninsula I work in the ais at a grassroots level with my community and I've been in this role for over 15 years in 2019 hearts initiated the first community hui providing a platform of constructive community corridor post-earthquake cruise ships christchurch city council when issues within our local school arena were impacting hugely on the well-being and social cohesion of our community there was a chisholm in the community that saw friends fall out and people banned from restaurants for expressing their views over cruise ships the kaupapa around the hui was to explore ways of building cohesive working relationships with the council local groups and organisations in identifying community needs we have established wellbeing within community groups and continue to work collectively for greater community outcomes it is in this capacity that I bring you the voice of the wider community that I represent today community representatives who haven't spoken earlier presented well research statistics and information in their of our community and the impact of the reduction of service and proposed closure off the upper or service desk I speak on behalf of many of the voices you have not heard but that I listened to our community grow disillusioned and disappointed with council many are saying there is no point in making submissions because council do not listen to us the decision to move the service into into the ukraine school and community library reflects this lack of communication the community feels mislead because reduction of service was conducted as a six-month trial but the draft ltp proposed closed both the aqua and littleton service desk permanently the council reviewed the need for face-to-face financial transactions and upgrade however a trained customer service representative with local knowledge would have presented a much higher level of transactions while also providing service to ratepayers local staff with appropriate training would add a true understanding about the needs of our rural community and enhance the customer service position the community would like to see the council support local jobs for local people but we see council preference to employ internally contribute to the well-being of our community are overlooked long-term permanent jobs for local people contribute to the well-being resilience and strength our community I ask the council to consider a strategic framework regarding resilient communities and remind them that a strong sense of community means appropriate services are made readily available and accessible active participation in civic life means that people when organizations are valued and listened to and that residents are consulted regarding important decisions the acquired service centre was critically important to our community and provided a local service whilst promoting social cohesion and supportive individual wellbeing just as the volunteers who now no longer work in the library or the museum at council's instruction where it's equally important to our community in the service they provided on a visit to the city centre recently I admired this spectacular 475 million dollar to pi convention center the 92.7 million dollar churanga library and the 301 million pedicure sports facility I question as to why my isolated rural and aging community has to fight to retain a council service that cost rate payers a mere 56 community without public transport and very soon without a bank our farmers are enduring record-breaking dry conditions and facing significant financial loss aqua remains on nibble floor water restrictions with a total ban on outdoor water use our business anticipated a difficult winter season covered 19 has poor stress and uncertainty that has impacted the mental well-being of the community overall it is also important for you to know that the well-being of your own staff have been impacted by this change of service a working partnership in collaboration with local government and community organizations are critical to supporting healthy people and communities there has never been a greater time for council to acknowledge their responsibilities in keeping our communities safe healthy and connected the reduction of removal of services from opera impacts a wider community on a level that you can often visit because you live in christchurch with a broad range of services and activities you cannot know or understand the value and importance of local services to rural community our lives and needs are very different to yours in the city I ask that the upcoming service the historic postal office building with well-trained locally based staff along with other core services I ask this for the greater wellbeing of what law and my community thank you thank you you just came to the end of the five minutes but can I just sneak in a quick question um schweitland services is is that uh this all of the central government uh agencies so you you provide information uh to the community for all of those and was there any has there anything just has there ever been any discussion between heartland services and the christchurch city council staff over the co-location potentially of um the two uh actually there has yes yes there has been discussions around that to no avail no no all right all right okay thank you very much for your presentation thank you thank you thank you uh the next one is and I'm sorry nikki I keep forgetting how to pronounce your surname that's all right snow ink snow like snow and snow like yank is an american but with an eye thank you
Um alexa kid thank you for giving this opportunity to talk today um I'm a doctor I'm talking today on my own behalf but I know I probably many of my colleagues would share my views um and I would like to address the issue of the um transport side of your 10-year plan I first would like to thank the council and your predecessors for all the work that's been done on introducing the cyclewaves for making it possible for people to cycle safely to scoot any which way they want to want to get about I'm passionate about active transport and spoke to a smaller group of you um back in 2012 promoting the infrastructure I live in mount pleasant I work in hillmorton I cycle every day and as I cross brown though broham street I am saddened by the endless cars that are all backed up that are moving at a glacial pace perhaps the people in those cars are not aware that the pollution inside your car is actually worse than for me on my bicycle and with your cycle ways pollution then I think about where do these people come from obviously at broome they come from roston and points south but there are also people in rangiora and points north who have very little option about how they get into town and when I look at your 10-year plan I don't see the word railway anywhere anything about trains at all which was what motivated me to put in a submission and um there are so many good reasons for the train from a medical point of view if you were to have a heart attack I'm sure you'd agree with me you'd rather be on the train and modern trains even have defibrillators sometimes you'd rather be on the train than you would be behind the wheel of a car in which you'd almost certainly have a very nasty accident and might kill somebody else as well you can do work you can relax you can talk to people we all live in our little bubbles as we sit in our cars and we know I think from covert we know how people and I guess thinking about trains I know that um light rail is the absolutely holy grail but it's a huge undertaking 2014 I understand that it was decided that using the existing tracks wasn't viable because when people came into the city they were too far away from their work but now we have so many different ways to do that last two three four kilometers of your journey that we could revisit that and revisit it soon so really I don't want to take up too much of your time I'd just like you to think again a bit about the train I appreciate that ecan and central government are also involved we hear heaps about all this just before elections but nothing afterwards thank you very timely thank you very much um victoria andrews akaroa civic trust presentation
Uh the uh next one is jim turpin thank you I think I know you I swam he swam with my wife in 1980 remember my wife was on the committee yes she was I actually you being witness to this on my closing bit what does that say save the warranty paul I'm saying it at the beginning good on you that's awesome that's awesome that would have to be the best demonstration of what the presentations have been about this morning than I've seen so well done it's you when you hear this one it was it was you two connecting with each other that you two connecting with each other you're gonna have to top that that's amazing yeah well hell thank you very much um good morning you've no doubt had time to read and digest my recent supplementary submission as well as my original one so briefly so now so there's time for you to question me or tell me where I'm wrong don't know where there's only three minutes of this main things and just the headlines so you've got the time you'll have seen the veiled threat and you could and should reject the officer's proposal for the land drainage targeted rates on this alone it's not the coming of this council to send out stuff that's got veiled threats on it amongst things there's also an equally and compelling reason to reject it though and that's because in support of its reasoning the proposal it mentions then completely ignores the original and continuing 100 percent benefit to those serviced by the land drainage rate and then promotes to unjustly penalize those who don't share any of that benefit and you may recall on my submissions I said if there was no drainage there'd be no buildings and there'd be no rates and the officers said that it's targeted mainly for the central business and if you understand my note if I did it clearly enough on the economy that's how it gets back to other people like this that you're trying to unjustly charge so think enough to put it in the right place um and handle it fairly and properly so this council must reject that proposal from its offices and act to that please don't forget the other things that I've put in my things now you've got two minutes I hope to question me and tell me where I'm wrong and then I'll say say the warren report again we've had a number of submissions on the on the subject matter I mean you've raised an element uh of it in relation was that was that in relation to the the letter that was sent or was that my supplementary I decided when I had put in my submission I was referring to a document that perhaps the councillors hadn't read because it was a supplementary letter that went out on the 31st of march yeah yeah relatedly you might say right yeah I've got to so I included that in my supplementary thing so that uh perhaps my submission made a little bit more sense will made more sense right okay I've me well I hope it came to come through was on the same sheet I'm I have got the letter I've got it somewhere but I've just um it's in my view designed to confuse and obscure what it's trying to achieve and if someone doesn't look at it very closely there's a lot of words and lots of figures and misleading things in there um you never get through to some of it that's my view right so that's that's how you've taken the way that that has been written that's what it's yes no that's not I take it that's what it says it actually says that doesn't say it's dismissed it that says well if we don't get this through we're going to do it anyway because we believe that we've got the policy to do it yet two pages earlier on they say they don't know what the policy is so they've got an undefined policy the officers I just think well you just outside of this meeting if anyone wants me to go and try and clarify what I'm saying or I'm doing at any time if they'd like me to yeah okay um but there's two reasons that's one on its own that I read is that if the council does resolve to proceed with this change the targeted rate will be introduced over two years anyway that's right yeah sorry no I'm I'm I'm just I'm struggling to find the actual phrasing that's all and um you'd like me to come up and show you I've got to copy the letter here too it's if you look at the thing that said that the main heading there's a covering letter then there's uh the proposal and if you go to the third page at the bottom of it I think it's alternative option two no change to existing land policy drains rating stuff that if we don't do the change today uh they say if we made no changes to the existing land and to come more in line with the policy key changes would be they would then move to consistently do what you haven't passed today that's a threat okay I i I i I just and they'll just do it on anything okay you gotta laugh on any property that's got a roof structure larger than a garden shed would you just about be any property in the world property you've got so they're gonna do it even if you don't pass it that's a threat no I i don't yeah I think it's um but I mean the way that I read that was that it was I didn't read that as a threat I read that as a that was the other option that they looked at um yeah but I i haven't had that explained to me I would read that a slightly different way but look you've drawn it to our attention and I think that's the most important thing and it is something that we will get advice on so thank are a number of people who've submitted on the subject generically so I think we'll be looking at it very carefully yeah well that's good well there are more reasons than just that too by the way no I understand that thank you thank you very much and save the waranui pool uh juliet hendry on behalf of general
Yes there is yeah sorry I'm sorry that was my fault oh no no okay sorry katrina katrina's looking confused yeah no so I'm yours you're katrina I'm katrina miller and sorry kerry because you're next right okay thank you sorry haley's actually going to start off for us today haley golina I'm one of the trustees of christchurch enviro hub and katrina is one of our eight debaters um you probably haven't seen much of us in the last few years but we just want to start off by thanking for you for the initial support way back in 2018 that it was um and since that time we've been beavering away on feasibility and where christchurch enviro hub sits in the landscape so we spent a lot of time looking at building a building and we decided against that and uh me being involved with the takara orchard showed me how tricky that was gonna be so um so we've partnered now with a number of organizations we're in the kiosk in the botanic gardens and friends activating that space and it's going really well we are actually going to be in the orchard as well and we've also got a small hub in a residential space which we are going to launch very soon um so yeah so that support has enabled us to really work through that sensibly and come up with these solutions so we're very excited about what the future holds for enviro hub um so yeah so we have also been working with um environment environment hubs ayotero with the ministry for the environment and we've secured funding for three years to put in an administrator to support our small not-for-profit groups in christchurch which is amazing it enables us to not take from the strengthening community spot and to but to do the work to support those groups so really today we're just coming into back to say hey you know keep supporting those groups with strengths and communities and we're here to also support with that money from the ministry which is great I'm going to head over to katrina now who lot of my role is about creating a bumping space so enabling people to get get together um every thursday I have environmental chat with kat I didn't name it but people come in and talk about environmental stuff at thursday on thursdays at the kiosk in the botanic gardens and we talk about anything during the school holidays it could be mums and kids coming in playing games and talking about how to have a zero-waste birthday party or otherwise we can have organisations and our network and our organised meetings in that time and just help them talk about some strategies to help enable their organisation and we welcome people to come in and sit and listen in if you're coming in um yeah there's no secrets um we also like to make sure there's an opportunity once a month for um to for environmentally focused people to catch up and have a get together so we have either green drinks or networking with a purpose so and it's networking the next event is networking with purpose on tuesday next week um and my first I first was last year and um that is amazing collaboration of organisations which get together and we travel down to arthur's past and help out down there we were working with ecan on this if we can actually get ecan behind us we can restore this ecosystem in the next five years as opposed to going back and yeah we would be facing um extinction for a lot of species and it's amazing just to enable people to get together um this saturday will be our launch of enviro kids um so that won't be us doing the work but every saturday will be a different organization in our network that will be providing activities for kids and this is just well-being for kids looking after our kids and getting them to take part in environmental activities and get out there and really make a difference now our biggest concern for the um uh long-term plan and for your climate change strategy is that they're separate um you at the start of the climate change strategy it says climate change is it separate this needs to be all incorporated everything we're doing we need to be looking at becoming a sustainable city we've you've got people in within um a city council who uh focus on the sustainable development goals if we can actually incorporate the sustainable development goals as part of the long-term plan we can make an amazing city and this is what we need to be looking at now um and yeah hopefully we can be here to help you through that so I'm run out of time for questions I see but that's okay I mean it's you you've made the um presentation and uh covered it off in your submission you know which is very detailed so very much appreciate that and thank you very much cool thank you and now we've got kerry little who's zooming in from
The um next submission is so maurice richards daughter welcome uh hello my name is maurice richards I am I am a resident of bikenam and I'm on the beckham neighborhood association but I am speaking on my own behalf today just um I uh I have a degree in sociology from the university of canterbury and I worked in advertising for quite a long time in christchurch and now I am a stay-at-home mom with two small children so I've got a quite small window where I feel like I can make submissions on things um while my children at school and I haven't quite gone back to work yet so I thought I would take the chance to do that today I largely support the long-term plan and appreciate the efforts and juggling act staff and representatives undertake in this process but I feel some changes produced proposed will actually reduce community belonging and I want a safe healthy environment for my children I don't think we are thinking widely enough about the social patterns and pressures that contribute to carbon emissions on families personal car use and to improve social connections and kind of make those connections by acting on a really local basis while I support the progress in the city on cycling I don't think we think enough about school zones or really talking to schools and families about what it would take to get them out of the car I also think schools are really really busy so it's so hard for them I know as a parent if you start talking about cycling they start to look a bit frightened and back away so I was thinking you know could we have a small program that provides some external resources and help schools identify what changes they can make as a community to encourage kids and their families even just to make it safer to cross the road outside their school which we know is actually a problem in quite a lot of our schools um the christchurch traffic emissions are too high and I think an emphasis on spending on roads to make improvements for cars and trucks is misplaced and it's out of sync emissions I support improvements um to the council work fleet and I can see the electric car sharing is working well for staff around the city I would like to see more work vans electrified um to show that there are other options to the ever-increasing numbers of trades people in the city using huge diesel utes they are noisy and they're polluting and they're really dangerous for small people and there's more and more of them and they've become really affordable and they're kind of flooding our suburban streets I'd like to encourage the city council to use their buying power to encourage suppliers an external contractors to make the changes to their vehicles to make them safer for others too and to reduce carbon emissions and this would include the consideration and measuring of the carbon use of contractors carrying out work further city council wastewater and flooding we need to continue to put attention to the damage caused by buildings on the port hills obviously in beckenham that's a big problem and also in wetland areas for our waterways and the rubbish and pollution moving through our street gutters again that's a problem in beckoning with the big gutters and the slopes down to the sea um taking the pollution into the old powerhouse in the other city rivers I think we need more urban density rather than spoiling developments in our wetlands and on our port hills these really just line the pockets of the very wealthy we need safe affordable homes not larger second lounges I don't support the land drainage targeted rate land developers need to not undertake work that causes environmental and flooding damage christchurch city council needs to keep them accountable rather than pass on the cost to rate payers to make more profit for developers thank you I think I think we've come to the end of the time allocated but um you've given a really good practical written submission which we've read and it's um it's very helpful and it's always good I'm glad that you took the time to come and turn up and present to it so thank you very much alexa kidd
Much uh we'll proceed with peter scholes oh thank you man my may I suggest that christchurch supports its best and leaves the rest she is not well dressed at this time yeah cinderella must stay at home and get depressed for her dress will get in a mess as she waits stress for her bus to arrive christchurch has some great attractions like its art gallery unfortunately because unfortunately because of an action it has become an institution of dissolution it needs yeah it needs the restoration of its old funding so it can become a place of reflection and affection as the black line of the budgets turns redder and redder do not do not be reckless well it is a pointless action for pointless action mindless sell things that are pointless and useless keep your head and send the block heads to their bed thank you thank you for the second poem that we've had it's nice because there's a there's a message in there what you're saying is that um the particular focus on um on the need for public and and that jeweller and the crown the commitment to public art as part of our city you know you've really touched off on a number of subjects yes yeah okay has anyone got any questions for peter thank you thank you very much thank you uh katrina miller christchurch and byrahab oh you're on zoom hello katrina welcome you can unmute yourself and far
Thank you uh penny carnaby banks peninsula conservation trust oh and also the climate change submission so if you just want to flow across one to the other um I am the very new chair of the bank's future conservation trust and I have with me kate white who's been associated with the trust um since its inception over 20 years ago and also was part of the work done to create the covenanting authority that the banks french conservation trust has so deep questions on biodiversity I will get kate to answer look it it is a um it just seems to have a really important edge to the ltp this year because it comes under the umbrella of the climate change strategy so what I'm going to do is give our comments on the climate change strategy and then I'm going to link that with the ltp and what we need to see and make seven points on the ltp so I'll I'll roll it in together um to begin with the the the trust does congratulate the council on declaring acknowledge and agree with the urgency signaled in the strategy and encourage the council to act decisively this is a very important issue and it really drives in our view the whole of the ltp we see uh it is an opportunity for the council to showcase the landscaping unique biodiversity of banks peninsula and including the port hills and we hope the ccc will draw our inspiration from the bank's financial ecological restoration story and use this as an exemplar showing that by have ha showing by how working together we can protect land water and soils and let the natural regeneration and native of native vegetation increase and by doing so accelerate the sequestration of carbon that's a really important point in terms of climate change we see the climate change strategy as a vehicle um to leverage and celebrate all the aligned activities um on the peninsula and I'll talk about those in a minute um but we do um while we um absolutely support the overarching framework we think the council's done a really good job in describing the goals and programs talk about it is is quite inspirational we do have concerns and it is to do with the ltp while the strategy itself the climate change strategy is is very clear in its outcomes and directions we're particularly concerned that the uh draft ltp um that there is a disconnect is the best way to say it between the aspirations of climate change strategy and your ltp and this is a this is a real concern but look there are opportunities in the climate change strategy um it talks about achieving our goals together um and we we certainly support the way it's structured we're particularly um our submission is particularly relating to goal four guardians of our natural environment in taonga uh program one building the foundation partnerships and resourcing uh program five carbon removal and natural restoration in relation to goal four and programs one and five the trust acknowledges and supports the submissions presented by the rod donald banks peninsula trust and federated farmers of new zealand there's considerable agreement with us um in relation to those uh programs look one of the climate trend strategy is that the way you you signal that you want to deliver the programs the council quite rightly says we can't do this together um you know that that that we need to build a grand school of support and and in that regard one of the signatures of the banks valencia conservation trusts work is our ability to facilitate and lead collaborations across agencies ccc ecan doc runanga naitahu parties lined organizations particularly landowners of banks peninsula who who earn up to 90 of the land on banks peninsula and of course communities the way these are all people passionate about working together on projects which benefit the natural environment and protect natural ecosystems and we strongly recommend that that the ccc leverages the collaborative work that the trust is doing in this regard the 2050 ecological vision for banks peninsula is an umbrella um collaboration across agencies and and the the trust and other aligned organizations uh we align the trust aligns all of its work with the eight ecological visions and I i suggest that as a really good umbrella for the climate there are collaborations on ecosystem restoration supporting private landowners to protect and enhance high value biodiversity david has mentioned the uh te kahu kahukura program uh in the southern port hills uh including the summit work of the summit road society pest free summit road and ultra mature quail island pest free banks peninsula and the wildside project which is a a project of collaboration across thirteen one yeah thirteen thousand five hundred hectares and importantly the wild side project of that that wild side landscape twenty-five percent of that is already held in public private or public reserve so that is already doing its job in terms of sequestration of carbon so we're staying to the council for the climate change strategy for the programs leverage please leverage what the collaborations that are already in existence let me now turn to the ltp and this is um I'm going to make seven points here um and it is about alignment we asked the council to extend the the bank's peninsula conservation trusts mou with the ccc by a further 10 years um it's we're work that we are doing on your behalf in terms of bringing the collaborations together it seems confusing to say the least that you're proposing to cut that fund back and it needs to I believe be either maintained or increased the other thing the the biodiversity funding in the ltp you're proposing 190 000 a year that is a reduction on the last ltp you're talking about a climate change strategy here and um we are saying that you need to at least double it biodiversity um is really around carbon sequestration and that's how you're going to achieve your carbon um targets in your climate change strategy it must be doubled we're suggesting uh 400 000 for the um for the each year through the life of the ltp we're suggesting that 15 percent of the 13.1 million allocate of planting across the city for purposes of ecological restoration be allocated to the te kaha kahukura project um which is around from gabby's past right around to mount victoria um for the planting um and enhancement planting of eco-sourced native say any more about the pest free banks peninsula except we're saying exactly the same as david did 120 000 for the 21 22 financial year and 200 000 on from that and 40 000 for the continuation of the feral goat program um look I'll probably finish there other than to say there are conversations we'd love to have with the council about leveraging bpc's current collaborative projects supporting uh banks political land owners there are a lot of things coming at them um they're incentivized at the moment to plant monocultures under the ets and it's crazy we need to be looking at the natural uh re-vegetation projects and uh we'd love to talk to you I think councillor templeton we're going to be talking to you about carbon sequestration and carbon credits we've got some ideas about developing a voluntary market for carbon and other ecosystem services I will finish there and hopefully take some questions thanks penny thank you did anyone have any questions there's an excellent submission I mean it was the way you waived linked they are very much and they were designed to be linked I know and I i think it was great that you did it that way right thanks very much thank you the um next submission is so maurice richards
What am I up to um harry stronach um rate payers and residents association kia ora welcome hello good morning the consultation document for the long term plan was full of pictures of summer of smiling children and so on in the way that long-term plans normally are the reality is actually a little bit different the general satisfaction survey that the council commissioned last year shows that in the previous five years the general satisfaction of council performance has gone down from 74 to 50 percent yeah that's completely unsustainable trend for any organization if it continues like that for the next five years you'll be down to about 30 so what's the council going to do to improve its performance especially the core activities and earn the respect of the citizens that it represents what is it about the long-term plan that's actually going to make a difference I mean I've read the long-term plan I don't see the answer what I see is perpetually rising rates and diminishing services and a steadily increasing disconnect with the rate payers in our area years we've conducted our own surveys and the satisfaction of accounts performance has gone down from 12 to 4 we now have over 90 percent of our respondents saying that they're not satisfied with the council performance the trend is exactly the same as in the city but why is it that in accordance on the peninsula we seem to be three or four times more likely to be dissatisfied we believe the underlying reason is that the council is unable to grasp the fact that the one-size-fits-all approach just doesn't fit the peninsula in acura the fundamentally different places to the rest of the city we have different attitudes different aspirations different ideas if we're going to work together for a constructive future then the council needs to put real meaning into the talk about strengthening communities what what we have at the moment is a widespread feeling that the council is remote unapproachable and deaf there's been repeated occasions where the council seems to ignore the results of the consultation process and just presses on to predetermine the outcome that's led many of time now that and that's very unfortunate that's not the way things should be happening this is leading to a progressive progressive breakdown in the levels of trust and respect between the community and the ratepayers in the council and that's a direct driver of those survey results I mentioned here's some key areas where the peninsula people feel that the council is failing the akara service centre and this will come up with other submitters unilaterally decided to downgrade it and then proposing to close it neglect the peninsula eroding you could read the entire long-term plan and not realize that the council runs a 230 kilometer network of rural roads we see the streets in the city being you know flashed up every time we come to town but we don't we're not seeing that on the royal roads they're going the other way the akara wastewater saga lack of any strategic planning for our area there just isn't a long-term plan the fallout from the cruise ship debacle there's no cruise ships at the moment but that have a plan and the permanent solution the akara fresh water crisis in the long term plan it says that the projected increase in demand for freshwater nacaro is going to go up by less than one percent per annum for the next 30 years that's ridiculous the real number is more like 10 percent people are going to are going to acquire and they're living in those houses that were previously unoccupied it's not about the expansion of the township it's about the population density if the council documents talk about climate change it says somewhere there that acura is especially vulnerable to increased drought risk well it certainly is here we are in the middle of may and for about three months there's been a ban on outdoor water use in acura that's no way to run a community the existing water supply is simply not adequate and the situation is going to become increasingly dire dry weather more people increase demand the council is failing in a core responsibility for providing an adequate water supply and this is an urgent and capacity so the council you can't keep ignoring the fact that more and more ratepayers are dissatisfied with your performance what the ratepayers and residents want is the efficient delivery of basic services water and roading what they do not want to see is the unnecessary gold plating waste inefficiency and frivolous projects and that's me for the morning thank you thank you you've just summed that up in the in the time allocated so I really appreciate you doing that and um thank you very much for your submission thank you
Hi my name's robin simon I'm a uh a new resident of diamond harbour um I'm pleased that I've just spoken after richard as if if you look at my submission you'll probably be familiar with it that's um it's one that was actually written by richard um I only know richard um by my reputation I've never actually met him before but I got emailed uh a copy of the submission as to be used as a template and I just got lazy and copied it and pasted into the submission um there's probably no point in me wasting your time you know I just agree 100 with with richard back him up I am concerned about the the the gullies there that's as a new resident there I'm impressed with those gullies you I'm two minutes walk from my place I'm in the middle of a wilderness and and the amount of plantings that have been going on there the amount of work that local people be putting in there planting these trees and maintaining gullies they'll be amazing and and I think the council has a responsibility to protect that and the pathways that have been put through it's been a huge amount of work from the local people so I guess um that would be my contribution just to ask that's looked after but I won't_''_82.159 I won't waste your time anymore richard has said it all thank you thank you very much did you oh so hang on you've excited a question you've excited a question from phil yeah well thank you thank you so much rich as well in in essence because I look at putting my developer hat on I look at it and say oh this is lovely it's got roads right around it so you can go in and chop some off there and chop some off there but the the most important parts of it are the dark green bits if they were another got covenants on them but if they were turned totally into reserve for the community would would you have any uh objection to that and against any housing over there at all no me personally um I mean I'm I believe I'm led to believe that that's already been designated it's already zoned as residential and I presume it's just going to be an inevitability that housing will get there if all the dark green boats all the green bits and and some of the smaller green roads by that where that waterway looks like I've just looked at the overhead plant of the aerial plant the waterway that goes through there that was maintained as a reserve either side of that and only the I'll say the light brown bits on your plan were residential would that help yeah well that's why we're wanting consult with the locals to figure out just you know where the boundary should be but you wouldn't you wouldn't want that to proceed without a broader consultation I think that's the essence of yourself I think also I mean if there's potential up to 30 increase in the population in the place that has a huge there I mean there's a school there is there going to be provision for for the school to be made bigger is there land put aside for that there's going to be raising a number of issues which are the infrastructure constraints yes in the area as well yeah thank you okay thank you very much uh I've got harry stronach
Appreciate it thank you next is richard suggest um this personal submission uh and the the part of I comment on a number of things the long-term plan but what I want to focus on is the proposed disposal of land behind diamond harbour there's slightly perplexing that myself and other members of the community actually have to submit on this as in 2019 it was declared to be a strategic asset and that was backed by the council and the community board anyway here we are again it's a bit like a zombie project um having to argue that there needs to be adequate consultation and a one-liner buried in the back of their long-term plan is not adequate in terms of local government as consultation goes there we are that's the land um others already have spoken to you about this and we'll speak to you again other other people will essentially I want to support what the submissions of the community association and the reserves committee and the community board submission you can see it's bounded by a considerable amount of housing limited road access once you take into account proposed covenants these covenants are in the state of being finalized but most of those the vegetated darker green areas are going to be covenanted however there's a number of points I want to make about that the boundaries haven't been defined yet there's the actual total size of covenanted area is larger than the actual non-covenanted area therefore the complexities of that covenant management there's a lot of restoration work undertaking dominates the the land and lastly the actual covenant idea is basically I think is rather a silly one um I don't actually understand how the council can have a covenant with itself and then going to sell the land to some developer who will then have a covenant and and then the citizens who are doing the restoration work will have to deal with a developer they should be reserved those areas just should straight be reserved right moving on now to the next final slide that's the smaller portion to be sold that represents the complexity of this proposal and when there on the top right hand side those are areas that I've spent the last six months watering the plants in that they're not included in the proposed covenant running across the the middle um portion there you'll see a white line that is a school track and which has been put in by local residents with support of the council um there's no protection for that either and um essentially if you also see there's a triangular portion which is of council land that has been encroached by um a neighboring property uh and you know you can't sell that sort of in the state basically this is a half-baked proposal it needs to be adequate consultation in the community community interests need to be taken into account and I ask that you actually have this removed from the long-term plan thank you thank you you've wrapped that up in the time frame allocated and as you say there have been a number of other submissions as well so we'll be um taking some further advice on it so thank you very
Uh next is um is it kai kai hitchcock from the green map my name is kai my pronouns are they them and I'm the program director at the green lab thank you for the opportunity to submit on this draft long-term plan the green lab creates urban green spaces for social good working alongside communities and partner organizations to create empowering experiences and to contribute positively to the fabric of our city we are one of many threads of creative community-focused organizations that we have a tapestry of creative projects community engagement and connection that contribute to a vibrant sense of place and identity in ototahi we specialize in collaboration and often act as a conduit as a small organization seeking to create significant impact we weave connections and work with others to complete projects we could not do alone pooling resources and maximising their social good we seek to uplift the collective rather than compete when working with communities we often take a participatory approach that involves end users in the design and construction this approach is an investment of time skill and resourcing into communities council's generous support mahi promotes

the green lab for the opportunity as I didn't only learn new skills but gain new friends I like that the courtyard is now a secure place with lots of potential I'd like to see art projects happening here we had enthusiastic camaraderie and a shared experience and grandchildren I learned how to use an angle grinder a cool part of our mahi is reliant on relationship building it is an integral part

Friends of akuro museum hat on and I see you've been joined by nigel harrison hi community board member and also the chair for the museum advisory group in support of the submission so um it's a slightly different mood in uh in this presentation madame um but particularly we're asking that there be no service cuts to acheroa museum we're adamantly opposed to them because it's central to our lives the museum as peninsula residents it fulfills a major role in support of education research and tourism in canterbury and beyond and it's a central element of a nationally historic site and has strong links with anuku again the detail is in the written submission so I won't prey on your patience but I'd like to demonstrate the fundamental importance of the museum to our peninsula folk at the agm for foam last year it was said and I quote the museum this museum is about us whether we or our families have been here for generations or for months the stories it holds are universal and specific timeless and historical is a conversation for the living for those looking in and on seeking to learn more about why we are who we are and how this happened this museum is the beating heart of our peninsula it is of us and for us and for those who follow as the recent red house bay purchased by this council testifies acaroa is a nationally significant historical area it's become an important hub for international and domestic tourism for over 50 years we've worked hard to ensure that the magic and mana of our part of new zealand has been appropriately captured and preserved the museum has had a long association with onuku we've put on exhibitions together the need to maintain access and service levels is seen particularly in the the importance given to our museum as an educational resource by schools in the south island in the months up to from february to may 2021 actual and planned school visits total 22 22 different schools including 559 students from christchurch canterbury in otago here's some school feedback the acharoa museum is an essential facility for anyone of archival material which museum educators guide our students through every year this year they accommodated 60 of our year 13s and I know many other schools visited them students have said things like they've focused on the fact that the museum has sources unavailable elsewhere to quote the akeron museum provided me with sources that I wouldn't have been able to access on the internet we get a deeper understanding from all the museum archives our pointers cuts to service levels will inhibit this crucial educational resource also like to ask about the proportionality of proposed budget cuts the activity management plan for the art gallery is proposing a 10 cut in activity costs for the museum over the next few years and a 12.5 cut in staff and contract personnel costs through to 2029 foam therefore has a question for the council for which we'd like a direct answer now the size of cuts proposed to acura museum's activity staff and contract costs the same as those being proposed elsewhere for example to the art gallery and other services we're also concerned at service cuts may be made in the coming years including and I quote where there are potential reductions in levels of service for lower priority sites we seek assurance from you by your answer to this direct question is accurate museum considered by the council to be a lower priority site and if so why there's another thing I'd just like to add before I hand over to my esteemed colleagues at the time yeah yeah no I see the time um the documentation presented in support of the proposed service cuts is unreadable you've had me here before complaining about the appalling quality of your background documentation and unfortunately it hasn't improved I urge you to read my written submission and you'll see why we're so grumpy about it nigel uh just one thing very quickly uh banks finish is going to get an international geopa status in the near future and heritage is a vital part of that that legacy going forward it's a it's the cradle of banks peninsula heritage tourism is something that we should be focusing on much appreciated thank you both thank you
Sorry thank you been managing the meeting properly I've been letting people drift so oh well I always grateful for a little drift madam matt it's a pleasure as always to see you and uh counselor turner again thank you and and the rest of you of course so I'm I'm a little bit schizophrenic this morning first of my presentations is about pest free banks peninsula and then uh in four minutes and 38 seconds I'll be starting to I'll wear another hat as chair of the friends of akuron museum so as you know in 2018 the council was one of 14 signatories to the pest free banks peninsula mou and this formalized the community-led program to protect and enhance biodiversity on the peninsula through the widespread eradication of animal pests we've made a lot of progress with funding support from the department of conservation and environment canterbury we now have a 10 million dollar five-year program we've recently employed 13 staff and we're targeting eradication programs for kaituriti and for the extended wild side which is just over first areas in a progressive rollout out to eradicate animal pests such as possums rats stoats and feral cats from the peninsula alongside this we have a program for the removal of feral goats from the peninsula and a substantial work program to engage with households and community-based groups for local trapping pro programs now for the last two years the council has helped the community-based predator control program such as predator-free port hills around the port hills and adjacent areas the sixty thousand dollars provided for both of the last two years has included direct support for trap building workshops to enable progress towards our goal of 4 000 households engaged actively in trapping by 2024 and supported pest control for takakahu kahukura where for the long term plan we're seeking council support to expand these programs and specifically we're asking for funding of a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for the 2021-22 financial year to continue the current initiatives already underway for locally led pest control activities and for takakahu kahukura an expansion of this funding to 200 000 in the following year and a continuation requested this will enable the extension of this program across the peninsula and into the adjacent christchurch suburbs we're also seeking funding of forty thousand dollars a year until a year ending june 2024 to continue support for eradication of feral goats from the peninsula this is a really important collaborative initiative led by the rural community on the peninsula and supported by council staff the department of conservation and ecan and it has significant benefits for biodiversity economic and carbon sequestration as I've outlined in my uh written summary so um there's a lot more I could say about that but rather than prey on your patience because you have it in front of you um I'm happy to ask uh sorry to answer questions do not ask us questions okay that's fine um pauline thank you just went out of interest we read in the paper recently about deer on quail island yeah is that on your radar as well as the goats or it is on our radar the the constraint we have is that in formulating pest free banks peninsula we one of them was to guarantee eradication of one particular species and the bulk of the money we received to get started was from predator-free new zealand 2050 and they were focused on possums mustelids and and rats we've expanded it with your support to include feral goats and we know quite a lot about feral deer on the peninsula but to make that happen we would need a whole additional funding stream is there any way we can stop them just getting to quail island obviously they go over when the tides out to there yeah they swim they're good swimmers um and they swim like at any time like even when the tides right in or are they going over when it's low tide I'm I'm afraid I'm not an expert on deer behavior or swimming activity in particular but we can we can find out for you if you'd like I just wonder if there's one access point that maybe we could look at fencing it off because it appears that they're actually undoing all that good planting thanks for the question good well thank you that brings you to the end of that one and if you would like to put your friend zavakoro museum hat on and I see you've been joined
Thank you very much uh next one is uh david close christchurch labor electric committee now I've got to declare a squillian conflicts of interest um on this one but having been the former mp for crusher cheese having known david close for a squillion years was my campaign manager at one point how many conflicts do you want but welcome good to see you well thank you madame um sarah will do the presentation sarah whitcombs of course I want to also introduce david close who was on the council for 24 years as you as you've just referred to um and I'm speaking on behalf of the labour electorate committee christchurch east local policy committee so I'm the chair of that but david close is probably the brains we are going to speak about uh two things one one smaller thing one larger thing the smaller thing is libraries the largest thing is houses housing we noted that uh the long term plan proposes cutting the opening hours of libraries and we consider this a a real disappointment for people who use last bastion of free public democratic spaces where people can go and access a bunch of things in addition to books so you will have had other people talk to that and the gentleman who spoke prior to us I think made that point really well of the value of libraries our submission is quite detailed and uh we've commended some aspects to the council but we're here to drive improvements so we're going to talk to key deficits with regard to housing in particular um as we know there's a housing crisis um and the council itself has set itself a goal of the provision of accessible affordable and safe housing for vulnerable groups of people in particular the elderly people with disabilities and people on low incomes I would also add that there are many people who are unable to access housing through private rental markets because of their own difficulties in that they they may not be able to keep their spaces there due to addiction or mental illness and social housing is an absolutely essential part of safely housing people with those this I'm in my professional life I'm a child psychologist I work for urang tamariki and as part of my work obviously I go into a range of different homes and the state of the homes that I go into where infants and preschoolers are living would make your hair stand on end the social housing the council provides is good but the 10-year plan is to restore the social housing units to the numbers that were existing before the 2011 earthquakes there is no increase in social housing in the long-term plan despite the increase in population and the increase of proportions of elderly people in our community there is is the existing housing stock is good but it is so inadequate to address the need so we propose in our submission that the council recognise the discrepancy between their own stated purpose of the housing policy and the actual implementation as described in your long-term plan we suggest that you debate and open house the decision regarding funding housing only from from user charges and the rates the the income related rents that's the phrase that you amend the long-term plan to provide for 500 additional social housing units in christchurch and I've left some time for questions good uh sarah thank you do you think that it's important that the city council itself owned the housing or that housing has increased overall even if it's us enabling it in other ways so we know so we saw that enabling in other ways um so do you mean through autotah housing trust um if it's if it's do you want to speak to this one day I don't think it matters how the houses are provided but provided they are provided now the council is chosen to do the work through the ototay housing trust but the otahi trousing hust has not got the capital the council has got the resources to provide that capital I think the preference is for those houses to remain on the council's balance sheet it increases the council asset it makes the council stronger and of course the income related rents do provide a significant proportion of servicing the loans that you not rocket science yeah we're also talking to um cchl our um holding company about whether there's a model that gets the best of both worlds as well so we are looking at it yeah I'm sure you are and I've read that but the point is you've actually got to put money into housing you've got to have capital in order to build housing and any scheme which relieves the council of putting any real money into housing is not going to cut the mustard you've followed that model for the last 10 years and it's k can take another 10 years to get back to the number of units this council had and facilitated in in 20 and 10 years so I'm taking 20 years to do it and it's such a discrepancy as sarah said between objectives you've set for yourself in housing and your performance well thank you very much that's um very well presented so um much appreciated thank you now we've I i think we're over time we'll just yeah that's right so um so could um
Opportunity thank you uh lottie vinson from the canterbury wea kiara welcome good morning thanks for the opportunity to come and speak to our submission um it's about the proposed rate remission changes for not-for-profit organizations so I work for the canterbury workers education association also known as the wea and we've been in the central city for more than 100 years providing adult and community education for the people of christchurch and we've been in our current community centre um in gloucester street since 1957. I really just want to make one main point which is that there are two different ways in which you can look at the rates rebate for not-for-profits and charities either you can see it as a let off if you like something that you let those in need or those in financial hardship off of as sort of handout for organizations that are struggling or you can see it as an investment an acknowledgement of the great work that's being done for no profit for the city given because you know that by making this investment every dollar is the city on providing for those who are less fortunate and the most vulnerable and for enhancing the city's environs so I'll just use the wea as an example I wrote in my submission that we have invested income and this is used to fund our programs which we offer to the community at well below market rates um and this we choose to do so that we can make education affordable which is something that we believe passionately about we're also just about to start really quite major renovations we're very excited to get our consent through from council we have a really aging building and it needs a lot of work which is going to cost a lot of money and we've been saving up money to do those renovations and earthquake strengthening as well but under the proposed changes we won't be eligible for the rates rebate now can we actually afford to pay the rates in full yes we can but will paying those rates in full impact what we can do for the citizens of christchurch and impact the every dollar that we spend meeting our rates obligation it's not a dollar in the organization's pocket it's a dollar that we can't spend on programs and on renovating our beautiful building so there will be a cost ultimately and it's that we feel that it's the people of christchurch that will pay that cost so I would just urge you to reconsider this proposal to change how the rates rebate is distributed to charities I would ask I'm really interested to know if some work has been done to find out how many charities own their own buildings and just what sort of savings are we looking at with this change I don't know if that works been done and I just think you just need to really weigh up the cost and the loss and if it's going to be worth it so I'd urge you again to consider the rates rebate for charities as an investment given to organizations who work incredibly hard and who will spend every penny whether they spend it today or tomorrow on thank you thank you I think you were here when I said to someone else that it really does help to have practical examples of um how proposed changes impact on different organizations so it was a very worthwhile submission has anyone got any questions uh sarah thanks lottie so just just to be clear the um wa has investments which it then uses the um the interest from to fund the activities which is why you've you sort of meet the the threshold for the new proposal plus you've got savings to do the renovations yes um but that's all tagged as well yeah I mean and that that investment fund means that we don't have to we've heard today even just while I was here from people um about the importance of the strengthening communities fund but having that investment fund means that we don't need to we don't need to apply for funding grants through things like the strengthening communities because that in effect is our funding but if we so we only we only have the the income from of that on rates the less we can spend on providing meaningful programs thank you thank you thank you very much
Uh uh ross christian so ross has a bit of a challenge with his um hearing so he's going to listen through the head uh right I thank you for this opportunity for me to speak on behalf of people who are disadvantaged either from some complaint like gluten intolerance that's embarrassing or some complaint like a mental illness I have experienced both both mental illness and gluten intolerance I think that the library should provide resources for all these ways in which we can have a greater wellness for disadvantaged people for example my mother had dementia and during those five years I cared for her this was the only source of inspiration for her to do her many many many many many drawings I think a library should have a library of pictures for people who can do art therapy because art therapy gave me time to do my own therapy my own therapy was toastmasters toastmasters gave me the confidence to speak about things like gluten intolerance and also about western samoa western tamar I was marginalized I couldn't speak the language I had because I couldn't speak the language and I went to a school called samara college I would go into the library and there would be books of a cavity of a thousand words what use is that a thousand words to a person who has a vocabulary of hundreds of thousands of words but fortunately a new library was set up the of nelson library and that was a lifeline for me it had books agatha christie and that allowed me to get over some of my teenage angst the acne the gluten intolerance and the isolation of not being able to speak a language and so that brings me on to how that library if it had a really good library a really hands-on librarian and they knew what a benefit a cd would be of course there weren't cds in those days they were unfortunately big tapes and whatever if a person had had that ability imagine what a difference he could have made to my life and but there's so many marginalized people in this city like this ethiopians what if they were given to speak english better and and and then of course there's all the great need for the breaking down of the barriers because that's what marginalized people suffer the most from barrages of intolerance ignorance and and and it just becomes a situation where the whatever they whatever their problem is it gets it gets worse because what happens is they resort to shortcuts to happiness like the drugs and I've been speaking to some of the mentally ill in the last few days and they all the places they go to there are gang members and what do you think gang members are there for gang members their source of income is drugs and so what I say is if we we can fight that by becoming a wellness community a wellness community where everyone can participate because there is a library that provides pictures for the people who have like my mother who has dementia there's books to help people who have a embarrassing thing and there's no charges because the people who are most disadvantaged and I have been on benefit where horrendous rules that wins puts in place and and and and without that you would be in a real pickle ross could I could I interrupt just for a minute because in your submission you talked about going to city luke's and peterborough street where you did art classes and that got knocked down in the earthquake so I'm getting the sense that you want to see a place like that back in our central city well I i went to the linwood library the old limwood library and that is now holding an art exhibition for the mentally and there's 15 mentally ill artists who are currently have their works on display in their old linwood library and so um rather than just the people of lynwood benefiting benefiting from from art therapy I think the re there's a even greater need for the people the people who are homeless the people who are rough sleepers yeah the reason the reason that I'm I'm I'm helping direct you here is that we've had a submission from a group that wants to city so um I'm sort of feeling like you're expressing the same view but from the point of view of somebody who would find great value in attending such a place yeah well the the problem with with mentally some mentally ill people is that it's hypersensitive like for example a person came to our myendle bowling club and he came to the christmas function but he didn't he didn't realize that he was he was supposed to bring some food right and and he was and he was reprimanded for that and and two years later he's si is still feeling it was a big setback yes and so I'm going to have to draw it to a close because you you've come to the end of the time that's allocated for the submission but I i did want to say thank you for coming um it takes great courage sometimes to appear in front of a a council and and make a submission but I want you to know that you've made a difference by doing so so could come forward
Could come forward right not intimidating at all that's what to say and the person outside said by the way it's not intimidating at all so I think wrong okay hi my name is lynn and I'm here to represent the new brighton community gardens thank you from all of our volunteers trustees staff and everyone else who is using the gardens for taking the time to read our submission and the support you gave not just the new brighton community garden it's more of a community hub really but all the other amazing community initiatives you support around new brighton and beyond we literally could not do it without you the strengthening community funds is an amazing fund to have for all of us and my understanding is that the likes of wellington don't even have such a fund I guess we do have a deep understanding of the importance of a strong community here I have been rolling in my bed trying to think of a way to make you understand and potentially commit to support funds like the strengthening community fund about the collaboration of the truly amazing people and groups I came across but felt it would not just do that would not do justice unless you worked within this field and it's hard to understand I did not understand it myself before starting my work as a funding and administration manager so a different approach perhaps my background is in business and heritage but my heart is with our community just perhaps I can build a bridge here in business it's very easy you have an idea perhaps meeting a need sing christchurch company a tick and the success they had and you go for it if it is successful eg you make a financial profit you invest more for an even bigger profit ideally you make a difference in the world environment at the same time any new business should really do can we not adapt the same thinking when it comes to community work perhaps we just need to redefine what profit looks like when it comes to community work and working or engaging with children and youth it is of course very hard to is almost impossible to measure within a financial year it is add that most community groups are so busy dealing with the stuff society often likes to brush under the carpet yeah and you can understand that we sorry did not print that we don't even have the time to share the work and successes we have and there are many okay by now you might ask yourself what does she actually want simple a subsidized or very cheap bus christchurch schools can book online so they can take students out to places of holistic learning and be engaged in concepts concepts of sustainability climate change and growing organic food a thousand dollar bill for 90 kids to come to our garden is just not good enough and we will not ignite passion for this subject within a classroom environment alone a bus at all it takes on that to note the global organic food market is expected to grow from 201 billion in 2020 to 221 billion in 2021 we should be only growing organic food in new zealand and get our kids interested in that second continue our new brighton community garden but also many others who successful in what they are doing like a business would fund it if it was success if it was making a profit invest don't cut down but took years to build by people who either work voluntary or work in part-time position but work in actual fact for 40 plus hours society already has a good deal with these dedicated heroes please refer to the atera community garden survey if you need numbers the work is in the millions of dollars so please buy a debate and have to make the impossible possible please come down to the down to touch the earth with your hands and remember what it is all about and we cannot afford a society which is disengaged with the ground we walk on community garden fit all the bills what the city is trying and needs to achieve let's turn christchurch into the first sustainable and edible garden city in new zealand let's ignite the passion in our children let's show the world how it's done while we have the term please feel free to visit our garden to find out more thank you it's a lovely garden I've been there more than once I think james you probably have as well I recommend yes thank you for what you do it's um much appreciated and thank you for giving us some food for thought thank you so much for the opportunity thank you uh lottie vincent from the canterbury wea kiara welcome
Hello I'm here to talk about the faranui pool um I'm a life member of the swimming club at the next uh pupil of the watanui uh primary school with memories of the pool going back to the 1950s I just want to talk about uh two things briefly the cost and secondly the value value of the pool and the value will be based on the idea of indoor pools compared to outdoor pools and the value the different values the pools have I won't say too much about the cost because I understand that is under discussion to work out uh realistic projected costs with the swimming club and and the council except to say that you can't assume that the poor surplus to requirements uh that as a result of dividing the value by the cost it can't just be assumed without doing due diligence and hopefully the time will be given for that so the second thing is the value and um I'll go back to dave kane a driving force behind the pool for many decades he expressed his round um also said they should be should be associated with schools and he was disregarded so from the mid-1960s councils all over new zealand insisted on um expansive lido pools all outdoors today in line with doug's far-sighted views one-third of council calls it indoor year-round facilities that's the christchurch pools with the metro limited hornby pools this will rise to just under 50 per cent in addition the establishment calls the best value return to cost ratio is the indoor pool privately owned pools go the year round and dodge the higher cost of outdoor seasonal halls which we all enjoy on a hot day the main value of the philharmonic pool resides in its intimacy and community spirit while pools such as qe2 and the new brighton hot pools have similar benefits for health and well-being pools have different values or functions acrogem the linwood and the metro pools and the christ college pools all in relative proximity will successfully operate because the christ college and the akrigen pools have different values or functions christ's college students will still use the metropole so it the functions of paul doesn't in its local community I think what's happened is with the move from the record into the christchurch city council um the the uh council and the club ended up in paradise operating foreign pool and with the new management I think there's hope to get back to what it used to be like with this cooperative management of the pool it's harder to get an understanding with a bigger organization compared to a local victim borough council similarly similarly it's a myth that the closure of the following pool is needed for the success of the metro pool the pools will have similar benefits but different values or functions for example whatenui offers niche accessibility to different local schools ease of parking for busy parents and access for older people the success of any pool depends not on any fancy facilities or they're spacing out from other pools but on good management continuing high density density housing in the wreckage area the emphasis on low impact exercise particularly for those of advancing years along with developing and planned will see the indoor facility used more effectively in the coming years close parks and people will keep walking and running you close an accessible year around indoor pool and this will be the first time a large pool has been closed in christchurch centennial used to have a small pool and many people unlike the closing of an outdoor pool will give up regular water activity the club needs a fair and reasonable time to demonstrate the pool's viability in line with other indoor private and public pools that operate function differently in close proximity to each other accept the long-term plan but facilitate a provisional operation of the foreign pool along the swimming club thank you very much well we have we've had a a series of songs this morning for the first time but it's been really helpful thank you very much thank you um uh ross christian
Uh janet mulligan mourinho good morning council my submission is brief and not um of huge importance maybe however I'm um personally I have a background in health acute nursing home care and volunteer ambulance although I'm well retired I do continue to observe people and understand their needs I like to walk and ride on the buses myself while I still can and reduce my car use I'm very fortunate to be able to do so now but due advancing age this may not be possible in the future I was unaware of the proposed closure of the metro ricketton bus lounges until I read an article in the christchurch star and wondered why a notice could not have been put in the lounges where people could see it I also wondered what the review which found the lounges were no longer needed entailed and understandable complaints of disruptive behavior by youth which may have related to the proposed closure this however seems to have declined I have talked to random people that I encounter when I use the bus lounges myself nobody seemed to be probably are not able to make submissions for one reason or another I did think of the reason for downturn in use because the tourists and visitors use the lounges a lot particularly the big one with wi-fi in it and there were also intermittent closures during the infrastructure repairs of ricketton road on completion of which the bus stop has actually ended up further away from the lounge I do hope that the closures might be temporary until visitor numbers pick up in time I also realized that the lounges would have cost a significant amount to set up I think about five years ago and wonder what the future plan for them would be recently I have noticed there appears to be less use but that may have been secondary to school holidays and continuing very mild autumn weather but it is to be hoped that any closure can be post-winter if it does come into effect I agree with all the comments that were made by community board andrea moore made about the closures I also note that the central station has 10 buses arriving and leaving the mall which is a significant number and I feel justifies the waiting areas thank you very much I mean that also meets the time allocated but thank you very much I've said to a few of the submitters that it's really valuable to have a submission from someone who actually utilizes the service rather than making a sort of a a distant comment you're making a very personal comment and it's very helpful for the counsellors to be able to consider thank you thank you richard tweedy hello I'm here to talk about the whatenui pool
Oh we're we're good to go we're carrying on yeah jan bernie jan bernie thanks jane sorry thank you for the time jambooney from brooklyn's the council land divested from the crown and services in brooklyn being well maintained security has improved somewhat and the roading team are currently carrying out a program of surface earthquake repairs and to their credit this team have carried out works exactly as they stated in the time frame they indicated to me thank you however the earthquake damage to rivers stock banks drainage ponds and flood management still have not been addressed specific funding for restoration is not apparent in this long-term plan early in 2020 a commitment was made to brooklyn to develop an action plan funding for a planner budget for planning delivery and development plan were derived from the previous long-term plan delivery of action required capital established for a budget to deliver works this was to be from this ltp plan I can see no specific capital established for a delivery and no specific works identified in this long-term plan for brooklyn's and we community is materialised councils are required to have community outcomes under the local government act community outcomes are important high level and desire to book the goals desired goals and it aims to achieve these outcomes seek to improve social economic environmental and cultural well-being now and in the future they are used as a guide to inform the planning process and set our priorities so also help to focus on a vision this is this council has not delivered the community outcome for brooklyn's brooklyn's properties have endured market blight due to the red zoning we must have a higher level of attention for earthquake restoration as a correction I note that a number of submitters are seeking improvement brooklyn's needs the loss restored we are still at recovery I do see an allocation of 21 million to the otakuro avon river corridor specifies a portion of that allocation will support future plans for brooklyn's port hills and south shore this is too vague for a long-term plan brooklyn's was managed by sarah regenerate christchurch council community board parks unit and now our budget the otacaro avon river corridor the wider waitai coastal burwood community board committed to supporting brooklyn's in a written submission to the pre to the previous annual plan the board's oral submission diverted that to this ltp council stated a budget from the previous long-term plan and we announce the council stated a budget from the previous long-term plan and we now start the process all over again with a budget push to another wards allocation councils delivered words commitments promises but no action disappointed confused frustrated yes the council game plan is not right if the council will not provide specifics the lgea provides that specific funding and financial management policies and information are provided for this ltp I'm asking the council to provide specific time frames specific projects specific works and specific budget for brooklyn's and importantly delivery thank you thanks very much jan thank you for making the time to come and make a submission that's come to the end of the time but thank you for doing so within the time allocation thank you much appreciate it thank you janet malaga
Anthony wright from the canterbury museum oh just just anthony nigel's here my name's anthony wright director of the museum um I bring apologies from david ears our board here who couldn't be with us today but I'm supported by our independent board members tom thompson and until very recently grant lovell who's had to slip away for a memorial event for the two of his staff that tragically died on taranaki last week so he's sorry you can't_''_26.64 be here also supported by nigel and margaret noble who is our newly appointed operations manager at the museum um I'll crack straight into the presentation because I'd like to make the key points um we're overall very grateful for the uh council's support but our annual plan has been very carefully prepared over many years particularly in relation to the effects of depreciation costs over a 20-year horizon so we've negotiated this over many years with yourselves and the other three clas that support the museum it's been approved in full by the three district councils and with it will be pretty significant in outer years we acknowledge the difficult financial situation the council finds itself in we request you to review a few points in terms of your provisions in the ltp and they are particularly we request that the operating levy which has been put in at naught percent is increased to 2.7 that has already um been a reduction from the predicted 5 to 2.7 percent and that's involved no cost of living adjustments and operational cuts of 95 000 and against that christchurch city residents visitation has increased substantially over the last year from 84 000 residents to 129 000 residents and there's the overall visitation picture over a year a 20-year period you can see apart from the earthquakes and covert it is going in the right direction we further object to reduction from the 2.7 to naught percent because it will mean further cuts to repairs and maintenance our buildings are aging and so r m is high we'll have to look at our touring exhibitions and or staffing cuts as well this will impact on health and the long-term compounding impact on levy levels I'll come to shortly we submit in support of the operating levies for the next two years they are five percent as requested and we're grateful for that thank you we object to the inflation only figures that have been put in from 24 25 to 27 28 the next ltb review would be too late for our financial planning and those figures are critical to our future funding streams the other clas I note have included those requested increases in their ltps as I said before they've been previously negotiated and agreed and they have the effect of smoothing increased depreciation charges post our major capital redevelopment project the cumulative impact of your draft ltp provisions would potentially require 25 to 30 levy increases in outer years if we don't continue this gradual process that we've negotiated we submit in support of the capital grants that you have uh included in the ltp and they're detailed there in the submission thank you very much for those we ask that you consider bringing forward your capital grant the museum and the role at mcdougall it'll cause us you've pushed out our request by two years we can accept a one year later so we're asking you to meet us in the middle and and come back any funding delays will create us cash flow problems going forward and so we requested the museum premises start in 2324 and the mcdougall gallery in 2223 and that's the effect of going from what's shown in the second to bottom line there in color to this and for the mcdougall from this to this we submit in support of the capital program consultation on the robert mcdougall gallery base isolation um obviously the rng is owned by council and lease to the museum you have a provision for 11.8 million base isolation in basement under consultation this is vital for the whole project and also vital to secure the central government contribution we request that the capital grant is confirmed starting 23 24. and finally we submit in support of your targeted heritage rate we agree that this is a great idea for museums heritage for that happy to answer any questions questions from councillors sarah thank you so much and we've heard lots over the last couple of years on this what is the um what would the consequence be if we chose not to do the additional funding for the base isolation uh it throws the whole redevelopment project into jeopardy it's the basis of our resource consent that's out for a hearing is due in a couple of weeks time and it's a fundamental part of base isolation underneath the whole of the complex to make it usable but the mcdougall basically becomes unusable for museum or gallery purposes without that piece of isolation thanks thank you well that comes to the end of the time for the presentation so thank you very much for for doing so thank you thank you we have uh we're running a little bit behind schedule so this a lot behind
Okay thank you next we have murray james from the food resilience network and uh this is ros rolls and sarah butterfield we're the food resilience network atamayak I'll try and be brief essentially the food resilience network we've explained who we are hopefully you're aware of us we strongly support other submitters in terms of the ortakaro avon river corridor and the fact that we would like to see action brought forward rather than delayed and pushed back as it currently is the um the autofocus river corridor is a dual for all of christchurch not just for the east of christchurch and it deserves a priority in being polished and brought to lustre stock banking is enormously important within that because it needs to happen first before others with passion and vision can get in there and start adding some vibrance to that space um so that has our full full support in terms of other submissions about bringing that forward the food resilience network we're fortunate to be at what we consider the head of the otakuro avon river corridor with our that project we've received good support from council we feel perhaps that central government has however forgotten uh the community-led anchor project in its prime spot right there and we would ask for council to perhaps consider assisting us as the board in reminding our government what an opportunity that is and help us bring it to life where are we the other thing that's important is that the frn is not just a building it's not just the otaku orchard we have a whole bunch of activities that we wish to support we find uh funding for those and particularly for our coordinators roz and chessa to be quite a challenging area it is true also for many other not-for-profit volunteer organizations that chasing funding takes an enormous amount of resource volunteer resource becomes quite tiring after a while we would ask council to consider the manner in which funding is allocated to worthwhile community organisations we feel that reducing the strengthening communities fund is perhaps not the right thing to do we rely on that heavily to keep our organisation going while we execute the change strategy we uh like what's being uh presented there from council's point of view um and we look forward to being a strong uh part of uh facilitating the action that's needed in that space um we have a general view that council talks about social enterprise promotes it quite heavily across a range of organizations that we're collectively involved in we think that's a bit of a myth and the way that these organizations are funded needs uh needs looking at by council take for example avery house which we're associated with it can generate about 30 of its operating um operating requirements the rest of it has to come from somewhere else what else that's um probably the bulk of what we've got uh to say in our um in our submission uh if you've got any questions we'll happily thank you question uh yani thank you um it it just seems to me from your submission that we've basically got a landing that's just in the wrong place do you think there's a into the red zone um further up the avon uh otakuro river to help the orchard get developed as a you know a landing or you know a kind of key anchor point along that corridor sure if you think of it as a landing one that we've been funded for by central government with the landings established in the risk regeneration plan is that the one that you're talking about yeah I mean but in terms of funding priorities we've got lots of money going in for the aven but I don't know what are you asking a question that we're not capable of delivering on so perhaps if we could reframe the question is it is there anything that you think we could substitute in terms of bringing forward funding for that for the orchard given that the orchard seems to be a really good way of dealing with our climate change issue our resilience issue our sustainability and also having some activation along the river corridor yeah we certainly agree with all of those statements yanni in terms of how to fund comment on to council but that it needs funding um is certainly something that we put out there we've received good support we've got a community grant loan that's been provided to us which helps us get to cold shell that doesn't help us activate the cafe or provide lease income to our organisation to do its real work the two key points for me is yes it is a landing there's a bridge there for a new footbridge there's the band road under there it's a brilliant spot um we wish to activate it and we will activate it but we'd love to be able to get there not by having to bake sail it but by having coordinated what's the word global support in terms of funding to help this board activate the activity the space and um also up and down the uh takado avon river corridor where our membership organizations are rearing to go and get on with the job we can thank you very much and um that's very helpful to have such a detailed presentation this morning so thank you very much for that so the um next uh submission is nigel tarkowski and anthony wright anthony wright from the canterbury museum oh just just anthony
Thank you uh peter morrison from uh hospitality new zealand jordan welcome all right marina good morning everyone you would have seen me here before a few times um but this is our new regional manager nikki rogers who's just started last week with us so thank you for allowing us to present to you you would have seen our submission I haven't got time and five minutes to go right through the whole lot so I will just quickly get on to it um australia new zealand is a member-led not-for-profit organization and we represent approximately 3 000 businesses including cafes restaurants bars nightclubs commercial accommodation country hotels and off licenses throughout new zealand our uh canterbury branch has 380 members booked uh and the majority of those are in this christchurch city council but we also have members in selwyn hironui wymack and ashburton and we are presenting as well to those councils as I said we welcome the opportunity to talk to you um general agency does not see strong alignment in the ltp to support an enabling environment of businesses in the city within the prosperous economy community outcomes will be achieved is highlighted the city needs businesses to help achieve all their community outcomes and strategic priorities thus a strong and resilient business community in christchurch needs the support of its council continually passing on costs rates increases and failure to future-proof infrastructure does not support a thriving business community we are not asking council to fund businesses we are asking council for council to enable more development growth and progress through achieving their core business with excellence in removing unnecessary burdens on business infrastructure funding if you please read this it is very important to us and businesses in general um hospitality and accommodation sectors are viewed by some councils as an easy source of funds by targeted rates on commercial businesses or implementing bad taxes hospitality new zealand opposes the introduction of a beard tax as it only targets only those people staying in commercial accommodation you know I've said this before everyone benefits out of tourism the butcher the baker the candlestick maker so everyone benefits hospitals new zealand recommends further considerations as a given to the implement the our submission targeted rates and tourism be it terrorism or tourism or beard taxes concern our members who assert these unfairly place the burden of funding infrastructure or promotion on just one part of the tourism hospitality industry as rate payers businesses opposed increases to fund basic infrastructure that they may not receive a direct benefit from i.e in the infrastructure for in some areas for freedom campus we will prefer to see central government funding of infrastructure where local councils are unable to fund it themselves and if new funding schemes are required these need to be there needs to be an emphasis on broad-paced living and they need to be fair and equitable all business who will benefit from their further instruction and further infrastructure development short-term rental accommodation uh this is a big issue for us you know we've been here before presenting to you that and we are presenting to the hearing on next monday the 17th of may um in some parts of the country and I suggest here as well the preference for reference the preference for rental property owners to convert to long-term rental accommodation for workers and families at reasonable costs hospitality new zealand alongside other sector associations submitted letter to mbie in july 2020 recommending a compulsory registration data sharing system that allows for information collection from all operators of straw and a consistent national regulatory framework we do recognize that the council is already progressing well in the space through the pc4 work currently underway as I mentioned before we encourage the council to to approve the pc4 with amendments to further control visitor accommodation in residential zones and avoid avoid unhosted visit accommodation and residential zones impose non-complying activity status on unhosted visitor accommodation and residential units and can consider a threshold as to when residential unit is no longer a residential unit when the primary activity is visitor accommodation our specific comments you can read those about the rates while an average 5.91 increase for business is reasonable in year one we will want to see further rates increases across the rest of the 10-year plan fall into line for the proposed increases uh our key areas of funding we strongly support the otakuro avon river corridor of the arts centre and our all our board uh really support the art center targeted rate and secondly the additional funding for the robert mcdougall art gallery base isolation work these projects enhance key attractions of the garden city and encourage more visitors to the area we support more funding for christchurch nz while the funding to the organization itself hasn't been reduced hmz believes you should support christchurch nz further as they bring visitors of the year and increase the tourism take through their promotion and marketing the city and all we have to offer in terms of crochet gen z economic development work we would like to see more funding and support for all business businesses in the city not just no super nodes or growth industries also not in my submission is the national sports museum trust in new zealand I understand that uh uh bruce ulrich is uh presenting tomorrow um we understa yeah from the we we really support their submission and hopefully we'll get money you'll grant the money for his feasibility we are going to help with this as when we won the right to host the 1974 commonwealth games it was in july 1970 which gave us exactly 3.5 years to build plan and organize the games we're still three years to 2024 which will be the 50th anniversary why not have this project completed for that year when we will be celebrating these games again it's important we keep it as a national project and the public's perception but christchurch will get the benefits we do not support the central city business association targeted rate even though we're a member of that the council cannot consider a target rate on businesses in the central cities a grant given the businesses the grant is going back to have funded the grant in the first place furthermore if the council is aiming to improve the efficiency of the cbd and more people come into the city charging businesses in that area does not encourage new businesses opening if council pushes ahead with their plans we believe the rate should not be a fixed fee businesses in that area varying in size and revenue and number to reflect the proportional benefit I think I'll let you in there I did I did want you to complete that element of it because um that is distinct from the obviously the view that has been presented by the ccba but I wanted you to be able to speak to that element as well so thank you very much for taking the time to make a considered submission and to present to us this morning thank you very much thank you thank you next we have murray james from the food resilience network oh
Um next is um annabelle uh is it hasselman um okawaho um heathcote river network gordon welcome so we'd first just like to say uh thank you for everything that the council has done to support us over the last year and especially for the um your commitment to the water partnership the upgrading wastewater and stormwater the lower um working group and and the commitment to community groups there's a whole list there um for those of you who don't know we're we're seeking our vision as an ecologically healthy river that people take pride and care for and enjoy and we're doing this we're becoming a voice for the river and we're doing this because we care deeply about the health and maui of the river and connecting our community around the river you can many of you know we work collaboratively and it's all about partnerships partnerships at all levels our network supports a time when naitahu values are expressed along the river just as they are in the avenue or tokaru so the hour is honoured we the river we have 20 active river groups along the whole network and we'll hear more about that later so really uh we really want to point out that we need a focus on urban rivers and that a healthy environment needs to be a strategic priority of the council the o pawaho is the most degraded river in christchurch and it suffers from urban stream there's a huge amount of tension on the avon otakaro which is great but we also need to have attention on the o pawaho hika river which is a tonga so we need a catchment management plan and we need a commitment to the ish the actions key issues along the river so here we go here's ongoing we need ongoing programs to improve the health of our most degraded river we're alarmed that in the um in the ltp that the council will basically hold it be holding its own in terms of water quality and with all the increase of development within the in the city and with the waterway ecology and water quality improvement fund has been acceptable sediment is a huge issue and there's a whole lot of work that's been going on around that thank you and just to reinforce that the recommendations of the kashmir stream working group need to be implemented and the city council needs to lead by example in this space and there needs to be a huge focus on revegetating those areas of the port hills that are key sources of sediment and here you can see the confluence of the kashmir stream in the opahikit river stormwater is another key issue the community water partnership you to focus on the collaboration of developing that with all the partners and the storm the stormwater global stormwater consent and the stormwater management plan in the old pawaho and you can see in the lower river at stormwater the stormwater superhero trailer is an amazing interactive resource and a great way of communicating with the public and we need more of these innovative ways of communicating with our urban population there's just a huge opportunity there to get our message across the many of people may not realize that and we look forward to the time when um ccc andy can collaborate on a weed management plan and some of the reasons are in the following slide for example you'll know yellow flag iris but on the right hand side is this reed canary grass which is really taking over in the lower part the lower lower part around woolston so this is a trial where it's been sprayed but um without action that would spread right across the river and it is if you if you go and have a look down there if you don't know this is a connell reserve and across the river from that in the lower part is laura kent reserve and these are great examples of how if you harness together the action of the city council and community groups we get a great outcome and that's why the community partnership community partnerships program needs to continue or if it's a temporary one we need to have something that takes its place and we see this as part of the community water partnership that was signed the in schools it's supporting planting and supporting community groups and there's this great wave of community support that's coming towards our open spaces and particularly along the river we start with nine groups in 2017 now 20 groups and it could be 30 or 40 if we weren't having to restrain people from joining new groups or creating new groups and we're doing that because the council only has two poor urban park community rangers who have to cover the whole of christchurch and banks peninsula and we just can't_''_335.28 you know we can't sustain more community groups without more community park rangers uh four would be great an extra one for banks but it should show commitment and they should be part of not part of operations but really part of biosecurity um and there's no use doing all this planting that we're doing and supporting the sides of the riverbank if we uh keep having people parking on the on the plantings and the white bait is wrecking them and not only that but contractors taking them out so about enforcing the parking on the riverbanks and training contractors there's also consultation needed with our organization there's the proposed number of cycleways proposed along the banks of the o pawa hithgate river and we need to be involved in that process and to date we haven't been and we need to with the route selection and the design so we were seeking involvement in that process and there's a proposal for the implementation of the proposed mid-heathcote linear plan this was developed about 10 years ago and we're just asking the question is a consultation of 10 years ago appropriate maybe we need to go back to the community and look at that before it's implemented and definitely back to us as an organisation so our key message is let's all work together and help to restore the apollo heathcote river thank you for the opportunity thank you and thank you very much for your presentation I mean all of all of the language around partnership and working in a collaborative way and how much more we can achieve when we work reflect on the number of farm park rangers the urban park ranges so there's obviously quite a bit of work for us to be contemplating so thank you very much for
Uh the next uh one is um hugh uh nicholson and rachel um chills live from vacant spaces daughter welcome is the microphone going yeah it is thank you kiara tattoo um I'm hugh nicholson I'm the chair of the life and vacant spaces trust this is rachel shields who's um a ceo a worker she does everything for us um look I'll just quickly run through some of the things that we do for those of you who are not familiar look we're a charitable trust and really we're looking to regenerate and activate you know parts of christchurch by facilitating the use of vacant spaces for creative innovative or educational projects that benefit the community we were established in 2012 after the earthquakes but I kind of think it wasn't it's a response to vacant land which we've still got plenty of in christchurch as much as a recovery kind of project we're funded largely certainly core funding comes from the council we've got seven voluntary trustees and one employee and you know and we're certainly space in london so they're kind of it's a model that is is fairly well proven um in terms of what we do at the moment you know we run about 29 licenses 29 sites you know 18 of them are in the central city 11 are in the suburbs 10 are indoor sites and and 19 are outdoor um at the moment um this year the last year we've we've run 170 projects um and you know that's account you know that provides about 7400 days of that land being used as opposed to sitting vacant or about 15 000 days of activations as we call them so you know some sites have more than one thing going on at once um again all up from last year we do a whole lot of different projects you know we do community projects you know community gardens we help provide land we provide artist installations and you know provide spaces for artist installations murals for festivals and conferences for for community recreation we provide spaces for innovative entrepreneurs roleking gelato I think started out on and we take on some central city vacant spaces and we provide businesses and things within those spaces and we do that in suburban sites as well um and we've got a whole lot of this is just a list of some other projects we've got you know at the moment either running or we're people looking for sites um and I think what I really wanted to end up um saying I've tried to whip through this because I'd like to get some questions but we think this is a model which is really good for christchurch we think that we provide we leverage funding um you know for the council you put a little bit of money in some seed funding we get a whole lot of money you know we get a whole lot of goodwill land community involvement back for the city so you know and I think the the the value of the land that we lease is in the order of 2.8 million dollars per annum if you've went and got it on the market um of course why it's vacant and that's why we get it but it gives you some idea I guess about the kind of you know the good will that we managed to bring back into the city we think that's a good model for the council we'd really encourage you to look at a multi-year funding agreement so at the moment we're on an annual funding agreement and we spend you know quite a large proportion of each year sort of looking to to renew that funding so if you are going to fund us we just suggest if you can look at it in a kind of you know at a slightly longer term we think that would be a really valuable way which would you know we'd reduce the transaction costs and um and increase the benefit for council in the city and um yeah look I think we'd be happy to take some so any questions you've got great thank you uh james james golf thanks for that nice to see you here um just would you would you say there do with the likes of some other organizations such as you know you've got life in vacant space obviously then there's you know greening the rubble um gap filler and that sort of stuff so overlap or synergy or perhaps a bit of both we try to make it synergy um so we're ready to the people behind the scenes so we kind of we make it possible for people to use um vacant land we protect the landowners and dress but also we make it easy for people such as get filler and greening the rubble to actually get a get a site and to use it we look after the leases and then you know that kind of that sort of that background um stuff we have a partnership with the central city business association so we've just we just kind of recognized that actually you know we provide we do some work to support what they do and they you know support us so that's so good so I think uh yeah pool's on your borders man and paul's on the idea is that we can't afford to to have overlap if you like yeah so we don't do a great deal apart from the east by east project in the in the red zone where we kind of curate our kind of series of activities there generally we'd look to somebody like you know gap villa or or green or green lab to to um to to do the activities while we provide the land and yeah you're kind of like the broker yeah with the broker I guess yep all right well look thank you very much for your presentation this morning that's um very helpful um for our consideration thank you thank you thank you yeah good to see you um next is annabelle is it hasselman
Down here so we've got um bruce coleman and vanessa hale from fereme park yep yep kyoto now for something completely different and we're going to focus on heritage um um I'm bruce coleman as I said I'm a member of the ferrymed park limited company in vanessa on the park and finance manager and I've been with fairy mead for just over five years we'll try and keep this um brief so that you have an opportunity to ask some questions and keep us informed what your views are basically fairview park limited is the company that's uh was designated a couple of decades ago to actually run ferimid park so I'm sure you'll realize that fury park is a home base for 18 heritage organizations overseen by a trust our particular role is to actually run the park on a day-to-day basis employ staff do events all that sort of stuff we've been running now for a couple of decades on a business model that says that we're supposed to get income from park events to run to do all the other stuff I think it's very clear to us that uh that model needs a uh a radical rethink we just don't get enough income from that to be able to do all the things that we need to do over the last two years I think it's fair to say that the board and staff have done a really good job of trying to push that model to its utmost by having for instance over easter we we had some really good events and made an operating profit of about seven thousand dollars which sounds good but when you put that into all the things that we need to do in terms of capital um in terms of maintenance in terms of earthquake um thing it's very little so what we're basically asking the council to do is to work with us in a partnership to look at a different model for running theorymed to say we've tried the the current model and we don't believe it works we over the last two or three years it's't for instance currently have the ability to pay back some of the societies when they um when they do stuff like running trains and trams they do that at their own expense and their own expense to the material and all that sort of stuff we can't actually paid any money back to them we got into a a sort of a a feedback loop where the more people you get into the park and the more um things you have that's great for heritage and for people seeing the heritage and being part of their heritage but also means you get more costs so the whole model of trying to run events and so forth to get money to improve the park doesn't really work because the more stuff you you run you the more costs you have and you kind of find yourself at a I like to say that we've had really good support from city council over the years uh the strengthening communities grant that we get most years has been crucial to fearing me surviving we've had really good we've been ignored by the city council more a matter that we think we need to go to the next level and look at say a partnership agreement with the city council so that we can actually look at um where theory meets going to what part it plays within the whole offerings of public support supported things and heritage and tourism and all that sort of stuff and work towards that we have some particular issues that we think the council can offer offer us with we've got earthquake the number of buildings that need earthquake repairs as you would imagine um we've had a lot of under ongoing deferred maintenance which is now getting to the point where we don't do something about it the part will become unsafe and we won't in all conscious be able to to really um run the park anymore we've got um potential for new audiences if you like like the um the cruise ships is an obvious example but that needs some work in terms of preparing for all that sort of stuff um and the at the park has kind of run down a bit over the years we do our best to keep it going and to pick it up but it really does need some some real major input to get it up to an international facility so in summary um what we'd like the council to do is enter into a partnership with us to look at the business model that's currently operates at ferrymede and to see if we can't have a more uh forward-looking business model that's more realistic about uh income and expenditure and what it takes to operate a park like ferrymed it's it's perhaps a reasonable um parallel to say that motet in auckland gets multiple millions of dollars from the auckland city so the 150 odd that we get from the council is probably fairly small compared to that um so first enter into a partnership second to develop a um a kind of uh action plan to look at the the various medium term issues that we have around earthquake strengthening around deferred maintenance about round getting around and finally we obviously support the targeted rate for heritage buildings it's a great idea but we don't support it being limited to the central city can't see why some of that couldn't money couldn't go towards support for here for heritage at ferrymed which after all is probably the only place in christchurch where people can be actively involved in heritage rather than just going looking at it thank you I mean that's thank you you've um taken the time made available sorry the submission no that's fine uh and um but thank you for giving some serious thought to them to the method by which you would want to consider in a partnership over a couple of years with a business planning approach so I really appreciate that and we'll obviously take that into consideration when we look at the decision making on the ltp so thank you very much the next one is hugh nicholson and rachel um
Right caroline and this again is ltp submission and climate change submission thank you uh to begin with I'd like to say that I was surprised that in this time of climate emergency the long-term plan and climate change strategy are separate documents and I feel that neither document addresses climate change issues seriously enough I will talk to climate issues first in 2002 you commissioned an impacts of climate change and crisis report then in 2010 you produced the climate smart strategy which included such things to understand the implants of climate change monitoring reporting growing council and community capacity and fostering partnerships now we have the current strategy which talks about establishing a climate leadership group completing climate change risk assessment engaging with communities promoting awareness identifying options and planting 500 fruit trees are you kidding me you declared a climate emergency two years ago yet the next steps in the programme are still about developing partnerships collecting information and understanding the issues what have you been doing since the climate smart strategy beyond I admit some excellent drainage work I appreciate that the earthquakes and central have been has been plenty of time since for the information collection relationship building to have been done we need to do more for christchurch is a massive understatement we need faster action here a climate emergency is just that and it requires action now I'm going to focus on the net zero emissions goal with land transport contributing to 36 of emissions we need to make some major changes in order to get people out of private vehicles and onto public transport and into an active transport mode we need to change how the city is shaped in order to change behaviour in terms of public transport facilities the record and road waiting rooms are precisely the sort of facilities that we need it's like submitting cosmic hair said to make bus use comfortable and normal if you really can't afford to keep disability going at present and I really think you should keep it going then you need a medium term plan where these become the norm at all high use interchanges in the shorter term perhaps the council could consider installing public toilets near consistently late for cycling I'd like you to prioritize to continue to prioritize cycling structure particularly the development of separated cyclones the recent cycle cycling infrastructure development has been excellent but we need to keep the momentum up in order to normalize cycling we need to keep going and we need to do more supporting walking I'd like to see the council create more slow areas maximum 30k zones around all village centres and shopping areas as you're doing in wilson at the moment and narrow schools this is completely normal in other countries and needs to become so here we need to get cars to slow down in order to make walking and cycling safer we need to make car driving considerably less convenient to get cars off the road the car's current privileged position comes at the cost of other road neighbourhood and city users and is unsustainable in environmental terms uh I'd like to see then as the free inner cities um shuttle reinstated or at least evaluated so in terms of some other goals and programs um I support your greening steps I support your carbon removal and natural restoration programs proposals but again we'd like to see more and more tangible steps uh in in addition to indigenous planting on banks fincher I think it would be good to focus on protecting some existing indigenous forest remnants there's no point in planting more while you've got existing material being damaged by stock and pests so moving on to the long term plan my overall comment is don't cut services austerity hits the most vulnerable and it sucks the life out of a city to have effective communities you need to have community spaces and services that work well for people specifically keep the arunui library hours keep fingertip library going and maintain the mobile library libraries play a key role in literacy and learning support and in community cohesion community building is a key council service it's not all just about waste water and roads continue funding for community organizations these groups can help the city achieve its goals particularly around looking after the environment we can see that the council can't_``_274.56 do this groups rather than taking it out in terms of heritage buildings I strongly support the arts centre there's a whole city block it's a very significant heritage site now I would like to see the council can the multi-use stadium if completed this will create a large dead space right where the central city links with inner city suburbs and will make active transport between the two less appealing and less safe at night as construction is also sucking a huge money out of a huge money amount of money out that could otherwise be spent on creating more climate-ready city climate change red city or a more socially invested city this stadium already fails against town planning standards will contribute very little community to community building and will also likely be an ongoing financial disaster we know that the build it and they will come theory is bunkum and we've already heard that south island could only support one stadium if it's lucky I see no benefit in a race to the bottom with dunedin on a more general note it feels to me like what it believes in you've made a statement about the climate emergency but then you've gone quite quiet continue to invest in climate change education and be clear about where you stand be clear about the social issues that are important to the city think about getting key messages out to people why not run something like a sticker campaign on rubbish and recycling bins say one topic each quarter eg recycling water saving looking after your neighbours looking out pedestrians etc to conclude I want you to be brave and future focused to be willing to spend now so future generations will have an environment that supports them and a community that is cohesive and supportive and looks after its most vulnerable kia ora and thank you very much and thank you for um presenting within the time frame as well some pretty powerful messages there thank you thank you um the next one sorry that seems to have has that person
Gould and john's got two submissions the ltp submission and the climate change submission he's happy to to essentially present the two together so we'll do that so thank you for that thank you very much um I've got to get through a lot of material so I'll go really fast thank you to the staff for putting together a really comprehensive plan I have a few concerns these are big questions um the strategic plan states that the well-being of our people and communities is at the heart of what you want to do and promoting equity valuing diversity and fostering inclusion is one of the principles so why is the council wanting to reduce the grants to community projects by five percent surely these are the very institutions that you need to be working with in order to meet those things on that um same topic um the homeless people sleeping rough are unlikely to come and submit today so I'll say a couple of words on their behalf I've been in christchurch over 20 years and in the last several that inequality is getting worse and that probably the council and the population of christchurch are less empathetic than they were 20 years ago you've got a budget of 13 billion dollars over 10 years surely you can spend spare a few million or tens of million to actually address this problem next point rainwater harvesting it's an area that I have some expertise in I've worked on it for 35 years mainly in africa china and the pacific never really looked at it at christchurch because you've got so much good water here but there is a real opportunity if every household in christchurch had even a 1 000 cubic meter rain water tank for reducing the capacity of all your storm water and waste water network helping flood protection I put in a couple of small tanks and found them really useful when water restrictions came in and excellent after the earthquakes when the water was cut off completely you want to build resilience you know promote water conservation and rainwater harvesting and that I come back to that osmond brook in germany in two thousand new zealand dollars to put in a rainwater tank particularly so I'm urging the council to do a cost-benefit study and particularly looking at households in flood-prone areas to start with finally a point on road safety the motorway here appalls me because people don't know how to drive you need a really urgent campaign you need signage like you have on the passing ways on the state highways to get people to move into the slow lane so they're not weaving in and out if you don't there is going to be a you know their lives will be lost I promise you and I haven't written a letter to the press yet but I will soon so please driver education and signage I've got a few other suggestions there a technical advisory group for citizens to work with staff and council to offer the expertise on water transport climate change biodiversity establish a citizen sustainability award scheme aimed at ordinary citizens who are doing great things composting sustainable transport you know whatever on on sustainability and well-being and also I moving from garden city to first eco urban national park um right I'm coming to the end of my first submission I don't know how much time I've got left but I'm going to just break it very quickly and show you a quick ad break stay cool carpool don't make a fuss take the bus can we have the commercial break thank you here is I'm glad you all understand german this relates to both submissions um my next submission is on the climate change strategy and you have identified transport as making up more than 50 of the city's submissions and yet you've got a great bus network but they're all running empty they're part of the problem if they're empty if they're full make them cool and then they'll help to to address those submissions the the city council has declared a climate and ecological emergency the last time there were 420 parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere the sea level that was three and a half meters higher than it is today it is an emergency it may take centuries to unravel but unless we do something now our children and grandchildren will not forgive us so instead of going for net zero in 2045 make it 2035 go for 50 reduction by 2027. um you know we're still cut stuck in this endless growth paradigm you know just you know build more expand more motorway extensions um more satellite settlements with no thought of sustainable transport and what about terrace airport and I'm afraid madame mayor I was disappointed to hear you sort of passing the buck to the airlines and say they have to decarbonize you're not going to have hydrogen powered or electric aircraft flying to europe or or asia you know anytime soon maybe that's why you had the electric plane in the library I don't know if that was anything to do with the city council but anyway a few things on program number two understanding the effects of of climate change you're only looking at new zealand bangladesh is a country the same areas within 10 meters above sea level where are they going to go we've seen what five million syrian refugees have done in europe where are all these people gonna go we're not worrying about ten thousand people from tuvalu or whatever they're gonna be millions of people on the move will new zealand and christchurch be willing to accept a thousand ten thousand a million climate refugees currently new zealand accepts one thousand hundred it's good to see that you're looking at climate change education but why not to all schools not just some um again for adapting to green infrastructure I would encourage you to look at the rainwater harvesting aspect um in terms of carbon removal and restoration you've got the most fantastic model out at hinaway restoring native vegetation 80 percent of new zealand used to be covered in native forest now it's 20 there's all this marginal upland farming and I know that's a different area from you but invite jacinda invite james shaw go take them to hinaway let hugh wilson tell them that his 30-year doing and if you haven't seen the clip fools and dreamers is a 30-minute one on youtube I would guarantee it I'm going to have to draw you to a close-up I've allowed you to okay so sorry just try I'm on the final point transport carpooling lanes like auckland t2 and t3 lanes um run the buses uh full by charging two dollar fares or let the youngsters the students especially under 25s have the same benefits as the gold card holders doing a great job on the cycleways keep it up and cycle training for school kids one final plea please please please don't cut the community grants please don't close the bus lounges at ricketton because you'll need them when the bus is become cool thank you very much thank you and there's no time for questions no and thank you madam I do I am going to say I hope that you've made an equivalent submission to ecan I did a week ago and you showed them the video I i showed them um no but axel a different round of counsellors I i think we'll share it with them yeah thank you very much thank you thank you um
Literally over a period of time so thank you um maddie's um siri is it and annette purvis na punaway sports hub trust welcome good morning and thank you for the time to present today uh maddie um this is maddie suri and I'm annette pervis we're trustees of the napoona y sports trust and um the trust was established to support promote development strategic governance at nepunaway sports hub um firstly we want to acknowledge the council for its significant investment into the facility and also its ongoing support of its activation it is incredibly an incredible success story the trust has a strategic plan that's been in place for two years with three key pillars sport so maximizing growing developing creating greater collaboration between the sports community making sure that our community is well engaged and that it's a facility open to all and then thirdly the future building the future of the park and its future plan our submission in particular builds on community and building the future for the park there has been considerable success with the use of the sports space that we feel that we have considerable leverage to make yoda and just to reiterate thank you as annette has said for having us here today and for the investment um from the council into nafunuai it is a world-class facility we just wanted to show you a snapshot today of all the awesome community activity that happens outside of the founding sports uh just a few of our favorites um so we've got the the bike bridge the bottom left-hand corner that's a group teaching immigrants how to ride bikes we've got the walk for dementia we have some tai chi if anyone wants to get down and join in we've got the not so sports club an ambassador program for young teenage girls run by the ford foundation and then we have the now why we community group as well in there and one of our asks you will see is for the polo fields to be put under the narpunaway sports hub umbrella and we think this space will help us deliver more outcomes for the community as well so um our ltp which was the continued development of the entrance from reagan road and associated car park development it's a very busy park and so that development is it's a pleasure to see it there and is well supported and also the ltp refers to the progressive implementation of the master plan we as maddie has said we've also submitted that we believe the acquisition of the polo fields into the broader napoona why sports trust would enable us to provide broader recreational use and also event overflow we're also interested in being able to have some support to do further research and understand what the broader community community would want to use napoona wife for you know maddie's showing you some pictures of already some of the opportunities that groups have found but we believe that we there are significant more groups out there that we would like to understand what their needs would be and how we could turn the punaway into almost a local backyard where local communities or other community groups would come and enjoy it and therefore we would use that for the development of the master plan making sure that what we're actually planning for the future actually fits with the community and the sports use and lastly we just wanted to finish by saying how delighted we were to see christchurch scoring so highly in the national quality of life survey and we believe na punaway can help us continue to deliver this to this city going forward thank you thank you thank you I'm assuming that you've you've talked to the polo people in relation to the submission yeah we understand that polo is actually making a submission to be moved elsewhere they have yeah yes good just making sure that everyone was talking to each other yes definitely yeah any any questions no but look thank you very much for your submission and thank you for what you do uh I mean the I think the success of narpunaway is because of the relationship between the different codes and the way that it's come together really built on that strong community foundation so thank you thank you appreciate it
Invite martin woodward to present your submission thank you thank you good morning thanks for this opportunity to speak to you I want to speak about you saving costs saving money for the taxpayers I'm speaking two submissions one I made early in the process and the second was submitted on my behalf via the mayor and comprises correspondence between me and her and the staff and with the ce cartoon I believe common to both was a observation that as councillors as I understand it your role in governance correctly is to focus on the headlines in the ltp adjusting items the large items by time or amount whereas I believe there's a great deal of money to be saved by the council within the budgets around the delivery in the line items around operational expenditure the opex this is the territory the ce principally and his staff and include things like contract services and their performance in the internal optics um so while your governance role shield or probably hopefully does keeps you out of the the detail of that operation you do have a opportunity on your behalf chasing various things the objects costs I submitted on included one community engagement and reserves planning and expenditure by you in those two areas builds positive relationships with communities and importantly it leverages in-kind contributions from skilled ngos and active citizens effectively a subsidy back to council it's a leveraging opportunity and in reserves expenditure if only for a short time but ideally not um this needs a boost and particularly to get tracks that are closed post earthquake open again it's ten years councillors and the red cliff citizens want their tracks open again from my correspondence with the mayor I gave examples of unnecessary expenditure in public right away maintenance road markings and pocket park maintenance there's money to be saved in those and it can be found easily in the correspondence with staff there was acknowledgement that this was the case and I want to leave you just with one example of where that expenditure over comes road marking was agreed by the staff to be potential waste and in the correspondence we found that while the council has in place the citizens etc it appears not in some areas to have monitoring metrics for over expenditure so until you have in place metrics to over monitor your over expenditure you're going to be wasting money in contract services and in delivery if any of you walk to work or walk with your dogs or cycle take a look at the yellow road markings and see how many generations of yellow are still available on the ground that have been over marked unnecessarily if you can move your yellow markings from annually to 18 months in three years you'll save a third of your budget there's lots of those to be found it's the cea's job to find them it's your job director to do so thank you we do appreciate you coming in and actually making the submission I think that they are very helpful suggestions in terms of um in terms of looking out for those items of uh ops which uh can save quite considerably over a period of time so thank you um
So we will recommence uh the meeting and uh I have apologies uh well councillor galloway who's joining us by zoom um yes she's there and counselor mcdonald is an apology for the day um I had councillor goff down for lateness but he's here so honor that was when you had a you don't you're fine you're here all day so we'll take that off so it's just galloway and mcdonald of the only apologies I've received um I'm not sure where uh councillor chew is but councillor chu who normally sits next to you anyway um so I haven't heard I haven't heard from her did she say that she wasn't going to be here I wonder if she did I can't remember I think she may have said to me on saturday that she wasn't going to be here today so I'm going to put her down as an apology for lateness as well yeah I should have written it down all right so I'll put um I'll I I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried again decorations of interest just to be advised um if there are any items we're not actually making decisions at the meetings that we're where we're hearing the submissions so um that's fine so um I'll invite um martin woodward to prison
Um I i haven't seen counselor coca is she in council two minutes away so um we'll just we'll just accept an apology for lateness from both of them would someone like to move it tim seconded pauline put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried now with declarations of interest again we're not making decisions we're listening to the submissions uh so um if you have an interest in any of the you know membership organizations or any of the um issues for any particular reason then just just simply state those but it doesn't stop you sitting at the table and we'll move on to hearing of submissions so I'll invite mark todd to come forward thank you uh kia ora and good morning everybody uh for those who know me don't know me I'm mark todd um I am a recently retired trustee of the art center of christchurch I'm also a director of city care and a number of other public uh companies and I'm making of having recent retired uh and hoping to encourage you that the proposal to grant the monies for the completion of the event center are a no-brainer for the council uh on and if we go back sort of eight or ten years three key planks to the art center's um generation of funds just to support the arts and community activities at the center the hotel and the event center uh the university and other core tenancies and the hospitality and retail tenancies at the centre itself so with the provision of the grant um you will enable the bridging of the completion of the last of those three keep key planks uh I don't want to understate how popular the great hall and the other venues within the art center have been as the use is um function of an event center for the people of christchurch the event center in the old court theatre will be a magnificent addition to that and I have no that but many of the people here and and and as councillors and your friends and colleagues will enjoy the events and the like so I'm just commending that but I also have another little lateral thing that I want to put to you as a recently retired and now able to be independent member of the arts center board we have three major community assets the art gallery the art center and the museum and the robert mcdougall arts uh center right but with each other within one block of one another those three huge precincts of canterbury history and canterbury curated matters of I guess emotional attachment to all of us should work far more closely together they're physically close they have so many opportunities to share back office services simple things finance payroll hr social media combined marketing activity the like my my own personal background as an executive and one of the city's most successful enterprises where we ran everything for australasia for our business from this place um makes it a no-brainer for me I've used that word twice apologies that you could actually as a we could as a city save the ratepayer or the public of christchurch hundreds shared services approach to those three facilities uh and we actually made some effort in the future to bring them together in a community type basis I mean it's just blindingly it's always been blindingly obvious to several members of our trustpoor that that's an opportunity so I'm just seating that as an opportunity for the future for all of you because you as the council are the only entity here who can actually use leverage to see those three entities work together in the back off a sense and bring together probably the most attractive and closely linked set of community assets that we have that also have great um opportunities in a business sense outwardly for visitors to christchurch in the future so that was my one-off little seed that for the future thought and um I'm happy to take any questions if I've got any time to answer well no time for questions but I've just sort of indicated because um I mean it's a very good proposal suggestion that you're putting up and I'm seeing nods from the chief executive so I think um that might be something worth exploring and if you're open for it I'm I'm sure that if somebody from the organization contacted you to help work that through happy to help with that thank you very much thank you thank you thanks mate the next uh submission is bill swatto and bill carroll network of the islands trends I loved your pictures and your submission by the way we want more of this in elizabeth or none of this very good good morning thank you um so we're here to represent uh notice which is the network of the island stream and our society has been working over the last almost 20 years now and improving the uh amenity value of the stream for the local community um and so this as part of the society there's bill carroll who's our chair and I'm bill swallow who's the secretary now we'd like to thank the mayor and the city council for this opportunity to comment on the long-term plan it's greatly appreciated's uh one of the north west tributaries of the avon and is located mainly in the uh the waimari ward now in common with other tributaries to the springs to to the haven the springs which supply the water have been drying up for many years as a result of land use change and this is depriving the streams of their lifeblood and degrading much of their amenity value it is an insidious process and doesn't always attract the attention it deserves so our local community has a wonderful potential asset in the island stream its beds and bank add contour and curves to a largely flat and rectangular part of the city so that's really quite important for us and it provides a substantial green corridor of vegetation which doubles as an attractive and safe pathway for native birds in fact this time of the year it's absolutely wonderful to see the fan tails and uh listen to the bell birds an excellent part of it however our stream does have a split personality and if I can oh slide one yeah that's our uh avon head uh park and when it's like that uh when it has a moderate flow of water it's an enchanting soothing babbling brook which is highly attractive to residents now in the next photo this is what it's like on a bad day um when there's little or no flow it is a mosquito infested litter attracting ditch which is unattractive to virtually everyone and so the whole idea of notices we want to get more of the first picture and none of the second one if we can now as part of our planning we have consulted extensively with neighbors friends of the stream including local businesses and sports clubs and also city council representatives the christchurch city council has done its part and come up with a good plan to augment the flow of the stream from a reliable source and the cost of doing this has been estimated at 130 000 and by way of comparison uh the rates contributed by the waimaari ward alone are just slightly under 35 million dollars per annum now the finnelton why murray hereward community they've been very effective for probing the thinking behind our proposals to ensure that they deliver the benefits that we promise and also that they're cost effective they've also helped us in our consultation with both the community and the council so that's been really great and I guess after we after the working over the community board has given us in terms of the pro proposal I'm delighted to say that they made it their top priority uh for implementation so I feel that's really important so just to sum up given the circumstances we strongly believe that augmentation of the island stream should be included as part of the city council's long long term plan the we can talk about the flagship projects but these these projects are the ones that are the life and blood of the community yes yeah it's during the lockdown where the stream flowed through some of the public parks particularly crosby park uh there was a track worn beside the stream just by the number of people that were using it for recreation and the house for a while so it is a great amenity for the community well thank you thank you for your submission thank you for what you do and thank you for working so collaboratively with your community board I think that's um an excellent submission thank you thank you thank you the next submission is sarah dunkley who's joining us by zoom the benefits of technology welcome thank you very much um yeah it's a pleasure to be talking to you all um and um yeah and to be able to put the submission in thank you very much um now I um most of my submission was about uh the council plan to dispose of the property in diamond harbour the hunters road property um yes um now the only um uh things that I was really concerned about was the um with the tracks and the um sort of reserved land that's there um now I guess it's probably quite obvious to most people that the bits that have been planted by the local community and the tracks through those areas um the one part that I wanted to emphasize was important to keep that might not be so obvious is the section of track between ngatiya road and the school which is actually um goes through grazed land um yeah and it's probably I think it's quite a well used part of the track because it's the end bit before you get to the school so um a lot of kids would go through there to get to school yeah and I'm just a way of trying to retain that track um as part of the disposal process um yeah and the there was a couple of other things that I wanted to say as part of the submission as well oh but and I also wanted to emphasize that um the other excess ways to get to the school from the the top of waipapa avenue are not that good for um like for instance for my family uh we'd have to go all the way down to the main road which is a really long way or up to the um or up to it's quite dangerous because it's narrow and there's no footpath yeah um yeah and and the other thing I wanted to say um was about the water metering um yeah so I think it's a really good thing to have the charging of excess water um but I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't going to discourage people from using cloth nappies um and I said this in my submission just because um it at at the moment um it like like you don't have to pay for the water um and it might actually make it it actually disincentivize people that are already using cloth nappies from using them just because of the cost and whether there's a way to increase the limit if people apply for it if they're using cloth nappies or something yeah well thank you very much and uh I mean your submission is is very helpful we've had a number of um submissions from across across the um the harbour and uh so that you've raised the specific issue of the track anyone else has raised the the cloth nappies one but um it's a very good point because of course we all do want to encourage um what our own mothers used back in the day before they were disposable nappies filling our landfill so thank you very much for making your submission much appreciated thank you okay you're very welcome all the best thank you thank you thank you the next submission is jan buckland good morning thank you for the time I'm speaking on the rural rates differential policy which is not a good policy as it has just one point of measurable criteria with the rest being subjective and contradictory which leaves it open to interpretation and results in inconsistent application and lack of transparency I sent an email to senior staff requesting the quantifiable criteria on points in the policy the response ignored the questions and used deflection tactics the questions I guess couldn't_''_1567.919 be answered because they don't have the answers the policy uses terms like can't_''_1572.799 be grazing a few stock must be farming can't_''_1575.52 be commercial to where does farming become commercial the staff can refer us to dictionary meanings farming actually the dictionary meaning is the activity or business of growing crops or raising livestock it also uses terms of is more likely to be where say the presumption is tends more towards all very subjective currently you have cases of neighboring properties of similar size and value with one paying on average of 2k more a year and often has far more real farming activity happening how is that fair justifiable and equitable to all what tax service are they paying the extra for the use of aerial photographs google street view drive-bys information rot from rock rate payers which isn't great for community spirit to determine and monitor classifications are merely a snapshot of a moment in time yet the logical option of zoning doesn't appear to carry much weight if the staff were able to hand on heart competently say rural properties are correctly classified 100 of the time that would take an enormous amount of staff time to implement a monitor which could be put to far better use elsewhere about it they won't go public in fear of becoming a target as observations show is happening every rape power is entitled to know why they are rated as they are and if the staff aren't able to provide that then the policy is systemically flawed council I urge you to instigate some form of rate power engagement with the roller policy writers to develop good policy that is clear measurable consistent and efficient in its application like the district plan community funding please don't reduce that as these organizers organizations pick up so much of what the council doesn't have the resources for there's a good opportunity for the time spent on drive-bys and looking at google earth and the rural sector fibre there are many properties that don't have fibre and cannot get an answer as to when or if it is likely to evaluate eventuate the programming of works could be done so much better thank you thank you very much so that sort of comes to the end of the time but uh a number of submitters have focused on something that we'll be um looking at carefully as part of the ltp so thank you very much for your submission uh kyra foley and I think cora scott and rasha erie as well from school strike for climate welcome there's only two of you um thank you for taking the time to hear us school striver clement ototahi is a group that focus on focuses on holding central and local government accountable on climate action and demanding demanding that funding and resources are allocated towards our client your climate strategy that reflect the fact that you have declared a climate emergency we think that many of the points made in the long term plan are good first steps however there are several areas we feel um where we feel more as needed we want to see a focus on providing green infrastructure particularly cycleways in the near future this would mean bringing forward funding forward and construction of the aventakahrut a palaho river route and southern lights routes if we are to mitigate climate change the transition to sustainable modes of transport needs to come soon in an nzta study 60 of non-cyclers show at least some openness to cycling more the infrastructure needs to be there to encourage them older cycleways also need to be upgraded and many of the cycleways that we currently have are disjointed and stop with little to no warning transport is all about reaching a destination and if the city's cycleways aren't connected then they are not accessible therefore we support the local connections program but recommend that I have a particular focus on connecting students to their schools at the moment too many students feel unsafe biking and several people we know choose not to bike because they don't feel it safe um according to the last census 50 of students travel to school by motor vehicle this is too many we also asked the single agency be created to oversee public transport in all its forms the current system is inefficient and has led to a lack of accountability over the city's public transport networks climate education for future generations is also important future generations need to grow up understanding the problems they will face education programs such as enviro schools librarians and libraries are also incredibly valuable and it is a great source of education and resources for both climate change and a whole host of other issues as a group we rely on services on these services and proposed changes will affect us we ask that you continue to fund libraries especially in rural or low socio economic areas we support the council's new plan to deal with waste particularly the focus on changing our throwaway culture as in a sustainable world it will not be possible to live the same high consumption lives that we do currently we also recommend that the council provide an incentive for businesses to pursue low waste options such as sustainable packaging for example for food and to encourage them to lower overall consumption change needs to come from the businesses that are providing services to communities and producing large amounts of rubbish without this leadership it is a greater challenge for individuals to lower their waste production further education about recycling and lowering waste would also be beneficial to communities we have also made a that the funding and resources put towards this reflect the gravity of the situation climate change is the greatest challenge we face and though it is often spoken of as a challenge that our generation will face this is not entirely true we are not the ones with the power to act now at this time when action is vital you are and it is important that this is reflected in all your policies we will continue to hold you to account thank you is there are we willing to take questions yes no thank you um james great presentation thank you and it's good to see the younger people of christchurch um coming and putting their views forward so my question is and I'm serious would you take the time to think about standing for council at some stage during this next long-term plan uh someone like vicky buck who was the mayor for three terms here she was elected council at age 19. so that'll be within this next 10 years for you guys so good luck the question that's question um I think to make change in different ways obviously but there are definitely people within our group who would be looking at entering politics and making a tangible change in their area that's great hey it's a perfect answer thank you very much for um making the time and the effort to come in and I know that when the group came there was a real sense that there was an immediacy wanted for answers and and I asked you to come you know and you've come and I want to say thank you it makes a difference it makes a difference when you front up and um and put that in front of the whole council so thank you very much thank you is there a separate climate change submission that they're doing as well I don't know oh okay there is a different date different okay cool great thank you thank you uh right I've got uh k page coming up next good morning I wish to express my concerns at the possible closing of the record and metro lounges for safety reasons and other than those initially I was not keen on the lounges but now I see the benefit of them especially if you have to wait up to half an hour for a bus currently there are eight buses that service these stops two of every ten minutes which covers the number three that goes to the airport every half hour the number five route is every 15 minutes with a half hourly destination to rolleston vial templeton the other five routes are every half hour the pavement will become even more cluttered with potential passengers standing around with luggage walkers prams to go alongside e-scooters and the pack and save trolleys which are currently moved by the security staff with the congestion of the pavement how will the drivers be able to recognize who wants their bus as there are always someone heading to and from the mall at present it can be difficult to negotiate with four buses unloading and loading passengers so what will be like what would it be like if everyone has to wait outside in the elements now that the buses are going to be it more difficult for the visually impaired especially if they have to signal down every bus are you trying to discourage anyone from using the bus to ricketten because with no seating for the elderly and disabled who cannot stand for very long and the visually impaired will find it even more difficult to connect with the bus they want due to the congestion and obstructions I for one would not find it safe to use the stop should the lounges be closed the lounges provide somewhere safe to relax while waiting and also provides a place to get information for which bus which bus you wish to catch because they've got the timetables and they've also got a map showing the routes presently there are passengers who choose to change at rickard and because they find it difficult and unsafe at the central station interchange in the 10-year plan you state that you wish to create safe and healthy communities but closing the bus lounges and the foranui swimming pool would be the opposite thank you very much and it's actually really good to hear from a number of people oh I have I have to because I'm visually impaired but it's fantastic to hear from you and I just wanted to say thank you for coming and making this submission it's very very helpful indeed so thank you the next one is k risdon good morning madam chair councillors and residents may I take you on a trip to central rickett and show you what brings joy to our area it's wednesday not just another day the phone starts to ring who's up for it today we'll meet on the corner and let our feet do the walking while we do the talking on round the roads and what do we see a pothole sign missing rubbish dumped stream not flowing but don't worry we're on to it snacks and solve time for a cuppa at one of our lovely cafes which one we should support today because each one needs our help okay then it's on with a rush to the library bus with its height this is the highlight for a lot of us gather and go up the stairs to make a selection not for some the digital connection the browsing the fines what's this your book was great can I have it next oh what a bonus large text the rest this recipe was lovely and easy to bake and god bless jocelyn she brought the cake our old community library sadly all gone the connection community bond that gives so much pleasure this bus is a treasure let's walk down the road sun beating down or cold wind blowing rain bust lounge oh oh the difference it brings when you pop in the doors warmth comfort security somewhere to rest your aching feet keep the little ones close by your seat all of these tourist gifts the council wants us to feel now walk on to the pool don't worry won't be too cool this pool has taught generations life skills of determination reaching for goals team sports and perspiration all things we need to encourage in the young generation warren is is like a mother that's nurtured us from the cradle to the grave she population attire it's getting pumped to the brim and you want us to fit more in you want us for the amount of amenities I spoke of it's grim but these amenities make up the rim without them the wheel will fail I thank you for listening to my whale that was outstanding oh look we would love to have a copy of your submission please would you mind if we published it on newsline I just honestly think that's the best submission I've ever had in my life thank you right sorry about that um wow uh donald derrick thank you wow it's a heartache to football I can't top that one at all but I do have to say that um I'm also here to speak in defense of keeping the funding for the maintenance of the faranui pool I moved into rickerton about four years ago bought a small house there and I go to the farron areas center all the time I go to box fit two to three times a week I do yoga there once a week I found already that it's much easier to swim during the summer months than the winter months because in the winter months I'm not good at sharing a lane with two or three other people and that's the only option that ends up being left at the swimming times for us and I know that the reasoning behind closing down um the the funding for maintenance of the fahrenheit pool is that there's a new center that's being built in the middle of the city that will meet a lot of needs and I'm very grateful for that but the swimming needs in this city are multiples of what is already being provided and there's no way that this pool won't still be full all the time if it's kept open also while I have a good income I don't own a car and don't want to own a car to go out and swim I would basically have to get a car or losing quite a lot of time on mass transit I have a very busy life that kind of time so I'd end up getting a car if I wanted to swim I don't want to use those resources and I don't want to pollute the environment in order to access the pool so I definitely stand in defense of the pharaoh newly pool a side thing I also mentioned um I'm noticing that there's a thought about adding a new tax relation in relation to water use that tax in some ways makes sense to me but the way it seemed to be written is it's going to be based on household if you use a certain amount over which will be very hard on families in particular we have a lot of stresses on families in our society we don't do much in general to encourage people to have children it's basically an expense that people take on themselves it's very hard on them and I would like to support keeping on seeing wonderful families in my neighborhood that's it thank you um that's um does anyone have any questions I think it much thank you uh josh olds on behalf of alpine presbytery preston's project jordan good morning good morning kia ora tattoo thank you for having me this morning it's good to be here um I'll keep things short just to allow for any q a at the end my name's josh I'm here wearing two hats this morning I'm a preston's resident my family and I live in preston's park in marshland and I'm also here on behalf of alpine presbytery who are the governing body of the presbyterian church in this region I have a role that we call the prestons project based in prisons it's a community-facing role effectively exploring what it means to be church and a brand new community such as prestons both of those hats would lead me to have a vested interest in my community and one of the things you notice quite quickly in pristin's is that there's no communal spaces there's nowhere for community groups together there's nowhere for community meetings to be held we run a preschool club which while we make it work it's definitely not ideal and there's a fair amount of feather and poo sweeping every week but we make it work effectively what I'm what I'm hoping to see is a partnership emerge an opportunity here for council and alpine presbytery to come together and establishing a community space and so what I'd love to see happen is some land made available by council potentially in say the marshland domain and for alpine presbytery to be responsible for funding some kind of a building whether it's a prefab or something like that that doesn't have to be permanent that would hopefully allow for community groups to to use the space but it would also make possible some of the things we're hoping to do in the community as well um yeah maybe I'll leave it there just to invite you to ask any questions that you might have um aaron yeah thank you for your presentation um the uh did you ever visit the one that was in uh colombo street the one that prefab like a school prefab style with a couple of office spaces in a meeting room that you know maybe lions international put it in there before we put the permanent one up yeah no I haven't but I've I've visited the shirley community trust which maybe have a similar setup yeah so that's right it's moved there now yeah is that the style you're talking about saying just a basic right okay just a roof right it's gonna be better than the pitching club yeah yeah okay okay it's just just good to know where people are setting their their goals yeah um excellent thank you james pauline I'm just wondering um which side of marshland road you're thinking of yeah I mean we we uh the the biggest space that seems to be available is in that marshland domain there on the um the side between preston's and mighty ho road um no that's further up behind the news it's on the the preston's park side oh yeah right yeah I mean I don could go that just seems to be where there's some space possible right thank you I'll take phil as the local councillor thank you very much I'll I'll catch up with you outside that uh there is there is a ticket and stuff like that there is some work well in progress with the martian school trust who have sold their building down the road and we're in discussions with the developer that the cdl that did it the guy is very helpful and they're looking to build something and I'll show you a little picture of it I've just drawn up great and I'll put you in touch with um kelly barb's actually on I was going to ask about the martian hall because that's on the other side of martian road now they've sold it because it's old and naked yeah yeah got a handful now well I didn't know so I'm what you were saying is actually very interesting to all of us so yeah thank you number one yep it's just a quick question from me thank you for your dignitation have you approached the school there's a big new school there and are you able to access their space we have approached to school um the times that we were looking to use it weren't we weren't going to work we run our preschool music group on a wednesday morning which obviously would collide with school activity um the sunday morning space is is already used by other community groups zumba classic kind of thing um but yeah that'd be an ideal space it's a major development here too you know there's been a lot of lot of a lot of housing going there after the earthquake so yeah I'm told it's it's going to accommodate 12 000 people when it's all finished it's an amazing amazing development but yeah no it's good it's right to raise this and this is the right time to raise it um well we're just going to yeah so I thank you and I'm I'm sure that update you on what's going on with the local community up there as well cool thank you raymond dawson children welcome good morning so I'm here as an individual and I want to talk first of all about your job and then about people in the city and then a little bit about me in that order so first of all I think from your point of view about the ricketton bus shelters is my topic I think it's probably I suggest it's poor economics to close down something which costs so much to research and set up and is doing such an utterly brilliant job so um everyone I've spoken to and I've never used it this is just as a christchurch citizen that I am speaking everyone says that it's warm and safe and clean and comfortable and if they didn't have it they would not use the bus so in fact if you close it down you are listening your revenue from buses so good point to you as council other point to you is council on your website building a better future congratulations I think closing the rickett and bus shelters would in fact destroy a really strong building block for the future and I i recommend that you rethink that financial decision the people that I have interviewed and talked to about this they say it keeps hundreds of school children safe each day as you know ricketton is quite a dangerous street not because of school children basically I hope but because of the traffic in all directions at all speeds it also helps the elderly and the disabled keeps them warm and healthier and thus it saves you money in the hospital so I think that's that's a brilliant idea I've already mentioned the bus revenue just talking about myself very quickly I belong to the core disability group and to the disabled persons assembly I do not represent them with any authority I just belong to them and I heard a lot of comments about people who didn't have the speaking experience that I have to get up and speak so that's why I'm speaking as an individual financial area apart from the cold water I heard someone talk about about this ricketton the bus lounges being closed so I wanted to represent them and say please rethink that decision and about me for 20 seconds I am a published writer and a speaker but I chose the rickerton bus lounges as my priority before the mobile bus all right so thank you very much um thank you it's much appreciated I've got richard ball atlas body corporation um and on behalf of a number of submitters welcome tinakota my name is richard ball and I'm here today as the kawafakari or chair of the atlas quarter body corporate um and as mir dalzell just said also speaking on behalf of a number of other submitters from the atlas quarter the issue that I want to raise with you today is actually really really simple we pay a significant amount of rates for waste collection and we do not receive a service and this has continued for some time instead we are required to organise private collection and we pay for that through our body atlas quarter for those of you who are not familiar with it uh it's in 36 well street it's a modern apartment block it's got 113 residential units in that one development and on the ground floor in wales street they're three commercial units it's high density by uh christchurch standards and it epitomizes the sort of development that the council's own policies are promoting for central city revitalization the issue is that the council's solid waste regime and what I mean by regime is your your policies your bylaws your service contracts hasn't kept up with the reality on the ground for what's happening in the central city so in practical terms as I outlined that means we pay between three and four hundred dollars per unit per year for waste collection but the council does not provide that service to us instead we have to pay for it through our body corporate levies we think that's grossly unfair and it's certainly inconsistent with other developments and residential units across the other parts of the central city so service for this type of development or stop charging us and at this point our strong preference is to stop charging us because the system that we have arranged privately keeps is working for us and if you want to know more about that I'm happy to answer any questions about that the issue is not new we raised it in december uh and in the hope that it might be able to be addressed in the ltp now I understand the ltp is a big long process and it was probably a little bit late to be included in that hence we're here today but what we were told when I discussed it with a staff member in february was that council staff were looking to undertake a comprehensive review and over the next year and it will be addressed at some point in the future a recent conversation I had just in the last couple of weeks with someone else on this issue when I told them that they laughed and the reason they laughed is because they said that's what we were told in which you can able to address it and it hasn't been so by all means undertake that comprehensive review and we know there's a whole lot of issues about waste and your vitals it is complicated it does take time but just stop charging us in the meantime we've already paid over the last three years probably a thousand dollars per household we need to totally add up 113 units you know 113 000 so it's a significant amount of money and just to be clear on a few things we strongly support the council's strategic objective of central city revitalization we've voted with our feet we live there we're advocates for it but we've been penalized for it and so that's what we're wanting to address we also strongly support your objectives of waste minimisation we provide all the same waste streams the council provides as well as some bins for corrugated cardboard recycling because they take a whole lot of space and we do that all at our own cost and it's not about not wanting to year of rates and when I look at your ltp personally I think there's lots of great stuff in there I'd love to see something like the red zone be a hagley park of our generation that we can pass on to the future or I'd also like to see more money spent on uh things like banks peninsula pest control for example so there's lots of great things that I support and I know other residents support so it's not just about that but the current situation is grossly unfair and inconsistent across the cbd so I'll just go through some slides and if I can hopefully this will work so first of all um to not charge us is very easy and some in the central city already have it that quote is from this little brochure here which I received with my rates last year a guide to my rates and as you'll see there's talking about the waste minimisation rate and it says central city properties do not pay this since they have a separate waste regime well separate waste regime we do pay it but we receive nothing and that line highlighted is from my waste from my rate spill it's only the waste minimization part of highlighted there the red bins I understand are paid for through general rates so it's not the full picture it's in terms of consistency across the central city that's looking off my balcony to the other side of wales street on the other side at number 25 well street is a low density development there are um I think six or seven residential units above commercial uh above some shops and they utilize the council's own uh waste stream no idea where they pay for it but they they do utilize the council service if we were to apply that to our development and in fact that's only half of the bins so our street footage is roughly twice the length but we would need to have 339 separate bins uh and put out 226 of them each week and they'll be in front of commercial units not against wool like that so eight of those provide the same waste streams as the council bins and four of them are for corrugated cardboard and it's small and it's compact because it's all shared and it's right it covers all the same waste streams and it's paid for privately by our body corporate so just in summary the current charging we see is unfair it's inconsistent across the central city it works against your strategic objectives of central city revitalization because we've been penalized for it and there's a clear mechanism to stop charging and if you want to undertake a comprehensive review go ahead but please stop charging us in the meantime thank you madame thank you very much I mean it's a very um graphic I love the fact that you overlaid the number of bins over I'm a central city dweller as well I live in a very small development apartment building over the road is the west fitzroy they also have the private service that you've described so um thank you and you've made it very clear it to check has someone told you that you can't have the service or can you have the service if you choose to have it what people have told us is it requires a council policy decision to me the the key policy decision is probably your ltp in terms of the funding side of it there are there are operational policies that the council has on sorry just let me be clear you're currently paying for a service yep if you as a resident ring up the council and said I want my three wheelie bins because I'm paying for the service are you told that you can't have it or could you have the three bins we could have the three bins but completely impractical yeah for our development I i I'm not to be honest I'm not sure because we we haven't asked for the three pins because it just doesn't work for the fact that we've got 340 we need 340 pins yeah no I get that but um yeah I mean this has been going on since submission and there's been a lot of work done I don't know if it's public that we can share with you over potential options so just I guess to reassure you that there is a lot of work that's been done already um that came in december last year so yeah I don't know those reassurances um is what we're looking for we're looking for a solution no sorry there was a comment made that we're doing a comprehensive review and that people laugh because they were told that a year of a different matter it's not in relation to a very simple question which is pay for or provide yeah I can show you the report if you want uh thanks so much um when it comes to the increasing number of high density developments across um not just the central city but mostly it's interested in other places as well do you think it makes sense for council to have some sort of standardized collection system for those rather than everyone doing their individually over time rather than yeah look I can understand that the council might want to ensure that if people are doing their own thing it's got to provide for the same waste streams yeah as part of your waste minimization objectives and we can understand that and support that one of the things that we the reason that we prefer uh to stop paying rates and organize it ourselves is actually the cost that we pay is probably about half of what we pay in rates because of the fact that it's consolidated down you know we're not collecting 226 each time the other thing is that it allows us because we've got a direct relationship with the provider if we want to change things around so for example last year we found that our cardboard recycling bins were overflowing so we just I can have another one and we're happy to pay with it when we first moved in there was no green bin so we said actually we want that so we asked for it so it provides for that sort of you know direct relationship which the organising party but if you're able to provide it we we absolutely thanks so the key for you is that relationship where you can negotiate what is required within your development correct right james kiara richard uh great presentation and I got to say what you're doing with your waste as a body corp is is admirable um are you happy to to tell us what that's costing you yeah so it's about twenty thousand dollars a year spread amongst I spread among 113 residential households so that's probably about half of what we're paying in rates right okay um and the other thing is that you've sold that you've made your point really really well I think you you're resonating with all of us um to the extent that I'm almost keen to uh to live it atlas except except accept that I know that I'd be living near john hutchison look around atlas I'm very happy to to show you around because I think it does epitomize the sort of development that the council and and thank you for the um other residents that have entrusted you with the time to make the presentation I actually think it was a much better presentation for the additional time and the methodology that you um used and especially the graphics so thank you very much thank you oh right we're having a quick break so if we could be back here at um that team past 10 past 11. get back underway and I'll invite case craig to make his deportation welcome madame mayor chief executive distinguished councillors you can't say it but you know it's true heritage protection has been a contentious issue in christchurch regardless I wish to take this opportunity to commend the heritage team on their 2024 delivery package and a long-term plan which includes repairs to the bridal path today I come to you not with a problem but a unique opportunity for our city to celebrate the bridal path if I could reach out and speak to my great great grandmother who as an early pioneer stood upon the summit of the bridal path overlooking the here to escape the famine in ireland I'm proud of the way she traversed the bridal path while pregnant and caring for a three-year-old toddler and I'm proud to be representing her pioneering spirit here today however when retracing her steps on the bridal path over summer I found it in a dilapidated condition graffiti on monuments overgrown with weeds historic walls crumbling before me and the wayside cross missing there is a need to prioritize the necessary bridal path restoration much earlier in the long term plan it is arguably the most important piece of heritage our city is responsible for by chronologically pre-dating restoration projects already underway in the central city the opportunity I present to you in this chamber today is to do something different and once in a christchurch city councillor's career christchurch has successively won the bid to host season two of an exceptional event called sail gp on littleton harbour next year this is a huge coup for our city as season one attracted a global event audience of 1.8 billion across broadcast social media press and in venue audiences by can show off the surrounding area of the littleton heathcote sale course to a global audience and distinguish otahi christchurch on the international stage let's not disappoint australian fans who can finally travel here and could walk up the bridal path to spend money at the gondola between races imagine how sail gp this global sailing event links together with the bridal path by remembering the pioneers also came to christchurch by boat the event can take on added meaning by effectively paying homage to our city's roots and as a quick win for you as councillors before your election campaigns kick off next year but importantly a vision like this is a win for the city the people and our heritage today I have outlined an opportunity to restore the bridal path for the pioneers in a timely and constructive manner for our city council and before fans arrive for sale gp next january using your position and influence together let's stand up and celebrate our otatahi christchurch pioneers this is why when reviewing the long-term plan I urge you to join me in the call so we can honour our pioneers in time for sale gp because their way will always be the christchurch way and I for one choose to believe their pioneering spirit is calling you to take bold action here today thank you thank you it's um thank you it's a it was a very unique submission and now our list of submissions but um the way that you presented it and linking it to sale gp I do think it does present an incredible opportunity so thank you very much for bringing it to our attention I'm sure it will allow us to consider it it's good to see you thank you thank you very much for your time take care now broader community support for the submission as well and now we have the uh representatives of the faranui sports centre to um present and thank you very much for undertaking the presente presentation in this manner uh it's really appreciated it's great to see so many young people here participating um and and this and you're gonna see a lot of councillors I'll take one from up here well thank you very much mayor and our councillors and we really appreciate um giving us this time to talk about all things foreign I'm the president of foreign swim club and firstly I'd just like to introduce murray mcgurr here who's our club patron murray's been um catherine it's you know I know I'm sorry I'm sorry to I'm sorry to disappoint but uh it's not appropriate for a counsellor that has to contribute to a decision with an open mind to actually participate in the and no just hand it back hand it back to somebody who's allowed here catherine thank you very much for that it was very kind of you to contribute it well yes I'm just going to introduce our murray um he's our club patron he's been with foreign for over 70 years and he's not much older than 70 so murray was keen to speak today but we've we've let him have a day off from speaking today've learned to swim we're here to talk about the legacy of the foreign army swim club and the many swimmers that have gone through it and just as importantly we're here to talk about all the community groups and schools that use farnui on a regular basis we've we've had over 45 submissions that we've submitted them and a lot of the history of foreign is in those submissions so we don't want to spend this valuable time going over a lot of the history and the issues around that we would rather just focus on on the future and how we can work together to keep the pool open so the plan for our submissions will briefly touch on the past and and then what we'd like to do is focus on the future and on a way forward so and we've also got a couple of people would like to speak to the history of the club I mean the first pool was built in 1911 it was started it was called the coronation pool and that started became 1920s in the 1940s it became the foreign swing club and um and that continues to grow it was they replaced the pool in the 1950s and then in the 1960s the it was the first pool in the south island to get a cover and incidentally there was also a um it was the first new zealand televised swimming event of a first live televised swimming event because it had had to celebrate getting a cover um the pool's had a tremendous record of uh success from a swimming position perspective we've had 56 of our alumni who have represented new zealand at the world champs or the olympics or commonwealth games as well as thousands of national record holders and canopy record holders and we've got a lot of them a few of them are here today what happened as well in 1960 there was a the pool was always owned by a trust that was formed in 1911 and in 1960 that trust was the pool was gifted to the the council on the condition that the pool in the land would always stay's something that we we really want to see go forward in the future on that in terms of the um the community groups that the the club looks after not only we have um five or six hundred learn to swim people coming through every week we have a lot of competitive swimmers and a lot of them here today so thank you very much everybody for coming along so it's a lot love it's wonderful to see you all supporting us we also have a lot of masters swimming swimmers going and some of us have been swimming doing the masters here for for nearly 50 years now I know it makes me a bit old 40 years we'll say we've always got power swimmers water polo players triathletes we also have um some of the muslim groups coming first they love the privacy and we also have 22 schools that use it for various purposes and we also have special olympics the fair nash school for the death also come in and we also have terreyo's lessons and which has been very to wakapurnuma groups that come in we have equis and also the stadiums used a lot as well so it really is um a fully utilized uh community asset and you know for example in february we had 22 000 people come in one day and in the month just using the pool or the the stadium so it's a a really you know useful well utilized asset um so on that what we'd like to do before we introduce a couple of our speakers and then we'll hand over to dave to talk about our plans we do have a petition here which has got over 5000 signatures um for people who would like to keep the pool open so I'm not sure who I give that to but would like to have that as a table please so first of all we'd like just to have um from foreign school felicity ray would like to come and say a couple of words just about her involvement with the with the school um I'm a reasonably experienced teacher and I've been working seen the value that faranui paul has given to so many of our students today I'd like to tell you the true story of a ten-year-old boy called daniel this story is daniel's but one that is not unique to our students daniel arrived in my class in 2016 as a ten-year-old his second day at school was when we started our week of daily swimming lessons at faranui pool his first lesson was the first time he had ever been in water deeper than his ankles daniel was naturally very nervous it took the five lessons just to get him to the stage of putting his shoulders under but I am proud to say that after multiple chances to build his confidence playing in the pool during school time and after another three blocks of swimming lessons in years six to eight daniel became a confident and competent swimmer without this opportunity daniel could have easily become one of new zealand's drowning statistics and without this opportunity right there many of our students could become one of new zealand's drowning statistics having furanui pool next simply cannot afford and that we as a school if required to travel for swimming lessons could not afford to provide our students either thank you I'd also just like to read out a letter from um a lady called sue williams now sue's dad was doug cain who was involved with the club since the 1940s and throughout new zealand doug is known as mr swimming so I'd just like to read out a letter from sue who couldn't make it today good morning my name is sue williams I am the daughter of doug cain whose involvement with the foreign oe swim club dates back to 1937. doug was elected club captain of foreign swim club in 1945 as time went on doug became known throughout new zealand as mr swimming and he was awarded an obe for his services to the community doug was involved in every fact facet of foreign growth and improvement of facilities for example heating and covering the pool by negotiation and fundraising doug's ability to raise funds was legendary his lucky splash tickets and housing nights in financially as we grew up it was natural for my brothers and me to be involved with foreign from a very early age under doug's guidance we learned to swim and often competed at foreign and inter-club competitions the forunui community was very proud when every single medal won by new zealand at the 1974 commonwealth games and there were seven of them went to a swimmer from farrell newly however it was doug's ambition that not only should the foul nearly pool be used to train competitive swimmers but also little johnny and little mary should have the opportunity to learn to swim doug also thought other sectors of the community should should able to use the pool for recreational purposes and on that note we have a myriad of swim trophies that we give away every year and the two biggest and most sought after these little cups this big and they're given to the kids who try the hardest and you call the little johnny and the little mary crow so that that's a wonderful tribute to doug kaine therefore as a family wider new zealand swimming fraternity we are passionate and enthusiastic in our support for the friday swim club the maintenance and operation the pool must continue not only for competitive swimming but for the myriad of community groups which use the pool now um you know that was really coming from uh survived because he'd be he'd be he's sitting down watching us um what we do with paul because he really was his he was it was his pull now what I'd like to do is to hand over to david ormsby who's going to talk about what we'd like to do for the future of the pool now david is a board member he's also his family have also had a huge involvement with the pool and also his son tycho is one of the top swimmers in new zealand to carry the new zealand team so he's got a a broad range of experiences um with with the pool so david chris uh thanks chris um look I i feels funny for me in my cultural paradigm to be most importantly it is appropriate for me to do that and an honor for me to be selected on behalf of our club and our community to represent them here today as well I think probably the key thing for me in the club in terms of our deliberations has been the reflection of every member around this table on the many battles that you've had to fight with each other and amongst the group and in the community and if you haven't already the fights that you will be having to look after those small members of the community it is the small community that always needs the support so we're here today to ask you to support us because having worked through this process we realize we're a small part of this community up against a juggernaut called the council and it is rather scary for our community and probably a relative question as to why we haven't fronted up before on previous plans because it has been quite uh scary for our community and now we've decided it is time to that and in that reflection I probably just have kind of googled a couple of things or thought about some things in my reality in christchurch city and you know on how some of you have fought for the small guy and just recently thinking about uh phil and uh james there the two vigilantes over natanui digging a hole in a trench to create some drainage for that small community I mean I admire the the courage to step out and do that got a little bit freaked out that in turn you got a little bit of smack on the hand from some of the council bureaucracy but you stood up for that community I also want to acknowledge council cotter as a resident of saint albans um for the last uh 15 years I think I want to acknowledge your tireless work to look at to get the re-establishment of eduard pulled back up and running pool that was demolished after 73 years and the tireless week that still goes on and then so we offer our support as much as possible as we can there lynn in 2004 and I think you remember this one fondly where we had to attend a hui far together uh over its insolvency and trying to save it from for our community and uh what leanne did was what whipped out of the room had a five conversation with the minister of finance and came back in and looked at me and said we've just decided that pune corker is going to pay off all the bills for this organisation and looked at me to make that happen look the outcome of that is that we do have an mri that still exists it's fraught with difficulty just like whatever it's never been safe it's always been at risk and we do ask for the same kind of support here as well the outcome of that is a governance approach and a partnership that naha far has with this council and a mandatory position on the governance board of that mural and that goes back to its inception when the council provided the land for that pool and it's in a similar situation to this was always there supporting this community and has never been not part of the partnership so we're really looking to help that as well and amongst the swimming community as well there is it's well known amongst those in the in in the pool community that people like councillor yani there and the fight to make sure that a pool goes into linwood a similar community to that that we've got in the small community of ricketton around the wadini pool because the social demographics in that area suggest that this community needs as much support as it can and community development only happens when they're involved in that and we're part of that community want to be involved in that community moment as well so that's just some examples of what we see going on so recognizing that our time is running out and I can go on forever and I was warned not to by the committee late last night when I got in off the plane we've got a number of recommendations here and happy to discuss those accordingly but of foreign pretty simple recommendation for this council given all the information that we've got and the information that we can debate and bring to the table for a a good conversation with staff on what what could be a better situation and a better future for our community and we want that pool to be there for the continued use and enjoyment of the people of the area you know and we note that both farinui and parikyori can operate in a complementary manner not a competitive manner in order to service all of the communities that we live within we don't need to exist in a pool type environment which currently exists which is very competitive between pools and their operators it's not necessary in our community and we're happy to collaborate and cooperate complementarily accordingly I think the second recommendation that we've got is that we want to acknowledge the foresight of our predecessors that someone telling me to hurry up we want to acknowledge the foresight of our predecessors and those gone before us and recommitting to the 1960 deed of and that is something that we can sit down and discuss and talk about to make it better it doesn't have to be what we've had today and it doesn't have to be what it looked like in 1960 it can be future focused for our not just for those who have come in the past but for those future mokopuna that will come in the future I think thirdly we want to recommend the re-establishment of the board of management has laid down in the trust deed and through that partnership we want to sit at the table with the council and the school and look at what that should be in the future and one of our acknowledgments is that we need to do better by our local school and we can do a better job with everybody's help we think as part of that plan through this board of management once established they can go away with your membership and develop further what this partnership looks like and the solutions for the future given the time frame for metro to be opened we to give us that time to achieve it so I'm going to finish the I do have a gift that I want to hand to leanne if that's okay can I give her a thing as well chris it's all paper red blue and some white red blue add some white fast so just to close liam I've just handed you over 200 pages of your own archives relating to foreign pool and over a hundred pages of uh new zealand archives from the watery school relating to the pool history as well I wonder if we've just saved you ten thousand dollars of staff time and photocopying which you could probably put aside to help us save this pool um it's probably not necessary to use it on flash lawyers to go through the deed because we've got flash laws behind us that you can use for free in that sense but it is it is something that's important to us and special as as the future of our pool so on that I'll close with something that the other day and it goes like foreign and how I've interpreted that is and it goes for everyone behind me as well it's that farenui is me and I am fading is our pool and our home and faring is the fenua it doesn't walk and it can't move it has a history it has a whakapapa and we want to add to that for our mokopuna the future we've spent a lot of time analyzing the numbers and researching things so we'd really like the opportunity to field some questions about what we want to do and if you've got any general questions please please use the time to ask them we'd love to well could we just start off with just perhaps um exploring that concept of partnership a little bit further about whether we can both bring something to the table is that what you've got in mind well then I think that's already started because we've got good communication and dialogue going with david bailey at the moment and david even sent a we and that's been that's that's nice and we have been working on that and through the whole last few weeks in terms of understanding that getting the right numbers on the table we have sort of both agreed to work in a partnership with it clearly the their idea of partnership is that we the pool closes and we move somewhere else so we're trying to work together so that our of cr options we can stay at the pool and work from there so I think that partnership model is definitely established and moving forward you think that there's a there's a model of partnership that could enable you to remain there as part of a different way of working rather than just council providing and and you operating yes I mean I at the moment it's the council effectively managed the capital and do the capital expand and we do the operational side I mean I think in terms of all the pools in town we run a very lean model um three or four years ago we completely restructured runs it we've turned quite substantial loss into a good profit now so and we've also got a wonderful new head coach carl gordon who is running a wonderful program and our numbers are increasing I mean it hasn't helped that it's now out of the you know the poor may shut so that's the sooner we can sort of rectify that and get a way forward that will help with our numbers because there is some uncertainty out there yeah but um I i definitely dave you had some good ideas on partnership too I suppose I'd put it down to something in my room wife reminds me of every day is it partnership and their marriage is never equal you know I'm more and I'm always on the wrong side of that uh that arrangement but more importantly if you look at the history of the fattini pool and the nature relationship between the council the school in foreign it has always been rocky and it always has been hard and it has required people to sit down and have to continue it's really a three-way partnership education that's right yeah so all of that is there and we're absolutely keen to ensure that we can cater for all of that okay uh catherine look can I thank you all so much for coming and speaking on this especially on a saturday um morningslash afternoon we've had a number of um verbal submissions over the last few days from individuals um in our area as well it's just to emphasize on the support a few things that I wanted to ask one was actually about the partnership the second one was I understand foreign poll is not just important to the community and ricketton in vodanoe but also the wider christchurch you mentioned that you had 22 000 visitors in a month um I spoke to junior general manager and I asked her about the statistics of where those 22 000 come from um is it justin rickerton or is it from the white of christchurch no it's the wider christchurch I mean I think one of the the real strengths of foreign it problem what it is at the moment because we're building a cycle line um so everyone have to cycle there in future um but it's it's you know it is a um it's it's going really well and so um yeah it's very positive and david you know I think as I said I use the word to work complementary to each other's we we provide services we think that are unique to other pools in christchurch and that shows what the number of families that travel from across town to whatever you use the facility including families from schools that are actually on on sites with council pools and a lot of the kids like the people because you know we do have very clean water I mean on a we're I think we're the only pool in christchurch that hasn't had a brown out in the last couple of years so for people who like clean water that's a that's that's a positive um and I think what's important is for those that know zealand and and he reminded me this time last year is what foreign has as a pool and a facility and a club is like no other in new zealand and it should be the envy of every club and swimming pool is the nature of the relationship it is with council and the facility and with that there's no reason why that club and that pool's not producing the best of everything worldwide and that is his dream and his challenge to us as is now that he's hidden there in retirement but I'd hate to think that we lose something that's been built over generations and he sees that is something that is the envy of new zealand now jimmy chen you had a question my question is over the uh past 110 years your long history in the brilliant history and you have a 200 000 people have swim in this pool have any the two generation even the three generation like a parents grandparent teeth swing in the same pool or not which I want to know okay absolutely I mean grandchildren are some of them here today they've swum and all sorts of them in mali grandchildren or wonderful that's all it's it's they're all still here and they're wonderful stories and so it's been some exceptional you know the response we've had over the last month for people coming out of the woodwork to talk about their experiences and you know with forunui not just in for swimming and learning to swim but also you know life-changing um changes to them and and how it's made them much better people and it's given them an out and for me I i work in the mighty community development space so things mildly come naturally to me but non-maori spaces don't come naturally and and the whanau maori who've been at farinui over the generations is incredible it's just not as obvious as we think it might be but but from a maori perspective the whakapapa goes back a long way can we and and james will know we can talk about families like uh the pitama family father was one of the coaches and they've got whanau that still swim at that pool now it's just an incredible whakapapa for all different community groups at that pool like no other and I think from another side as we can look at almost every other club in christchurch today that exists from a competitive experience perspective their whakapapa all comes back to starting at farini okay thank you thank you thank you very much and I i think that um you know to have a a a whole community come collectively in order to offer this level of support it does help us uh in terms of the decisions that we have in front of us so I want to thank everyone for coming and and thank you for the presentation that you've made and the and the cheeky haka there when in the background thank you very much appreciate it thank you very much thank you you can come forward you can come forward column yes I see you speaking thank you thank you you could give them welcome there's obviously been one little person there's been a lot of excitement with the previous submission so um but we've been looking forward to yours too colin so if you want to fire off now uh kyotokoto we have three minutes to save the planet um right as an ecologist I can tell you that business as usual is not going to save us it's not going to work we have to achieve a lot in a short time ecological literacy and connection with nature will be a significant part of that to achieve well-being and to achieve a sense of place in history and to some extent this will displace the paradigm of of the material expectations that we've had there's a whole lot of elements everything that I say from now on it seems might seem disparate but it's all connected I'll get on with it biodiversity equals identity protect all we've got um and that's for the plants for the wildlife for the fungi for us visibility of nature is key to its survival extinction of experience leads to extinction of more stitches and time habitat alone is not enough we need protected sanctuaries in order to support our charismatic endangered wildlife and for people to experience it and to add transformational value to the red zone and through the halo effect out through stepping stones to the wider city and across to the banks peninsula tui corridor all the heritage layers need to be reflected in the heart of our city not out the back out of sight out of mind we've got to get on with it and represent all of the layers of our rich historical tapestry within the heart of the city as for example a bush city in the cathedral square we also need to revisit the weaving of the symbols of the strength of the titility through the english and the and the natural and cultural heritage woven like strands of a rope down the central part of the avon otakuro river not just on the extremities you'll hear more about this for sure the christchurch 360 trail I've just done it and I've had people on that trail telling me than the el camino there's a people have actually done it and have been there and been on those other trails we support like the estuary trust a dog-free sanctuary with smart gates to keep out dogs that can't read even the godwits are happy with walkers at a safe distance as you can see in that and the walkers in the bush they're not along the edge of the estuary but in in an obscured pa um down the the bush between the estuary and the um oxidation ponds out of sight of those sensitive wildlife we've just concluded the city nature challenge through inaturalist and we tick all the boxes you can see there in the graph we're way ahead of all the other cities in new zealand that entered and we're probably in the top 25 in the world out of 400 cities in the world that have recorded as many observations and species as they could within their cities the concept is a marketing and branding exercise an umbrella to promote consistent focus joined up policies and actions within the a people nature centred concept and branding and marketing as I said for well-being and a slow ecotourism for service industries and I just reiterate there without people there is no conservation respectful connection to nature is key to conservation ethic guardianship and kindness and we know all of the other issues and tensions with people a complicated diagram but you've seen it before it's an elevated visual pathways to all the natural and cultural diversity of our city embracing all of that rich diversity and pushing back hate as I heard mazaharudin syed ahmed exhort us yesterday with tears streaming down my eyes as I listen to him recount the terrible tragedy of the 15th of march but he is positive and I believe we can enact symbols like this that demonstrate that we are one and we are uh embracing all of our richness of both natural and cultural diversity one of the things uh key messages I wish to leave you with is the enormous amount of effort that volunteers and donors are making to this planet to the city and the danger of burnout exhausted and to me the solution is not continual submissions year after year which for many may seem to go into a black hole but to bring together people around the table from staff the centres of higher learning manifenoa and the community able people who are concerned and especially often left out are those with an ecological mind I don't mean that we don't all have an ecological mind but we all perhaps there's a sense there's a there's a tendency to think oh we all know about the environment so why do we need a specialist you know we need more ecologists in that quadruple bottom line represented at the co-design co-creating table before decisions get made that then take enormous amount of energy and effort to unpick how do we pay for it all how do we develop this courageous and build on the courageous intelligent leadership that we already have well I believe we need to change the paradigm of what constitutes success these are much bigger picture things but these are things which all of us and all of our're in a privileged position in this part of the world we've got an opportunity to make a difference for the world we can be a leader we need to change the paradigm of what constitutes success we've got to stop feather betting and gold plating everything we can't afford it we need to be a destination province of long stay reflective echo heritage tourism with our story telling our narrative we need precautionary and accessible alternatives and transport urban sprawl on prime and land a whole host of things all of those things that are mentioned there there's talk about you know shrinking down you know council staff and shrinking down things we can't do this we need more staff we need more actions on the ground service actions that support the people of the city and I'm afraid to say the only way that that's likely to happen I've literally run away and I've let you run I took into account your statement at the beginning that it is hard to save the planet in three minutes but you other submitters so I thought it was worth just allowing you to complete the submission so thank you very much for your time and contribution thank you the next one is alana james nice to see you yeah you too do I just go for it do I okay great um I'm here today to oppose the 75 proposed reduction in the evening tours at the christchurch art gallery now these tours are free they're 45 minutes long and they're led by volunteers like me there are 40 of us our services are totally free but why take a tour why not just wander around by yourself well I want to convince you that this huge value in these tours and taking a tour an example the ralph hotery exhibition that's on right now if if you go into one of the rooms there in the exhibition you'll see there are paintings pretty much covered in numbers with the word sangro on some of them now I've seen uh visitors to the gallery without much background on hote or his art and they'll they'll just meander on out and they don't appear to have any significant connection with this artwork but the people on the tours do because this is what they are told they are told when hotary was 11 years old his brother jack died in world war ii at the sangro the river in italy and the hote family were poor none of that family could afford to go to the grave in the military cemetery where jack was buried but many years later when hotary was 31 he got himself there he got himself to the military cemetery he walked up and down the rows of tombstones of the young men of the maori battalion that were buried in that cemetery and he looked at the ages on the tombstones 19 20 21 22 and so on they were so young he took the ages on those tombstones and those are the numbers in his paintings and in one painting he formed the numbers into a huge cross and circled in the middle of that cross is the number 21 the age jack was his brother when cross that was his symbol symbol for negation he was saying no to those deaths no to war now I have seen people on the tours I have led who have been riveted looking at those paintings when they hear that back story they connect with those paintings they have empathy with hotary his pain his loss his grief uh and it there's huge value added for them when they are on those tours and and they have those feelings and they make that connection and after the tours you can go to the visitors book you can read this for yourselves there are dozens and dozens of comments which basically say I got so much more out of the art by taking one of those tours so the point I'm making is the tours they add value they give people a much better experience not only of the art but of the art gallery and um it would be very sad if we deprived hundreds of people a year of this excellent experience so I um respectfully ask that the number of evening tours at the art you I've made the comment to other submitters today that when people bring personal experience to the table it makes such a huge difference for all of us so thank you very much thank you howard dawson my submission is the ten year plan should not include the decommissioning of the week of the folinoui swimming pool my submission is my own I'm not associated with the club other than the parent of a club member this pool this council exists as a creation of parliament through the local government act 2002 and that and in that act it states the council exists for specific purposes which include the promotion of the social well-being of communities in the present and for the future the faranui swimming pool is 100 years old and I expect that during most or all of that time it has been supported by the local government of the time and this must have been because it has been good to do so in the words of the act because it promoted community social well-being so what has changed now why is it proposed in hundred years why is a good idea to support the pool not a good idea maybe it costs too much not so everything the council does costs fireworks community events infrastructure projects administration all cost but the quick the correct question is not what what is the cost but rather what is the cost benefit and the benefits are substantial indeed from spending something like two hundred thousand dollars a year at the latest count and a total council expenditure of more than one billion dollars per year spending this money on the pool achieves what the council is required to do maybe furunui is not needed with the new pools being built not so folanui is a dedicated training and recreational facility no lazy river no toddlers beach and the facilities of foreign of the of the following new kind are in fact in short supply I understand one christchurch swim club trains at three different venues because of the shortage of pool space and time yes para kaure will be a fantastic competition venue but consider this the crusaders will compete tonight at orange theory stadium but they's old and it doesn't look good yes it's older than the entertainment pools but it works really well at what it is and it's part of christchurch's history we've only had one international games in christchurch and in 1974 swimmers from this pool won gold medals medals at those christchurch commonwealth games christchurch streets are named after these swimmers and a part of christchurch history will be lost if the swimming pool is closed this council has a statutory purpose the promotion of social well-being in the community now and in the future enclosing the vibrant well-used cost-benefit positive facility which is forunui swimming pool will be manifestly inconsistent with this purpose thank you for listening to me thank you that was a perfectly timed submission so thank you very much thank you thank you um jim turpin is not here oh dorinda do you want to come forward now is that okay because jim's not here yet I mean we're ahead of schedule a little bit so thank you and you've got two submissions the ltp and the climate change one yeah and so I cannot price them no you don't need to price them apart but we'll just automatically throw it onto the six minutes yes is that right or the no still got a limited time less than six minutes as I understand it she's going to do three no no it says five minutes each yeah so two minutes yeah yeah so you're 10 minutes so free flow all right um thank you for the invitation today um I have had a look at um councillor sarah templeton and I had a conversation recently about aspirational business and she suggested I submit to the plan the long-term plan and the climate change strategy I my view is that they're both the same thing that we need to look at the future as a system and um we need to create as I said an aspirational business environment that attracts a different kind of thinking to our music we need to celebrate our difference I think we feel that we're different in christchurch but we're not yet celebrating it and taking about placing social environmental and cultural as well as financial values at the core of business I think that tells our story better than merely pumping up business to be successful to help design robust businesses that embrace trade change and attract young people and if we're designing a city and I i take on board all of the long term plan planning and necessary actions that you must take to maintain and grow a city I do think if we look at the future generation they might want something a little different they might not require huge highways they might not require the things that we currently think are important so it's really we think about long-term planning we need to think about the next generation I spend a lot of my time mentoring young people I only employ students from the university of canterbury in my business the reason I do that is because they keep me clear and focused on the future I'm in my 70s so I could never do that alone and I'm aware of and I'd like to set really like to to tell and that is of new zealand's first bee corp and it started in christchurch do you know eagle protect does anyone know eagle protect uh it's worth following up actually if you're interested um steve ada set up a business to make not we used to call them rubber gloves but to make synthetic gloves that we all need and surgery and food production all of that and be a bee corp now there's no harder task than that to be a b corp to do good in the world and create synthetic protective equipment he is now residing in the states as businesses run from christchurch he resides in the states and he is making it big time in the states why because he's set up around a set of values that reflect who we are in christchurch and what we stand for and he's not the cheapest brandon on the planet but he takes care of the production values he takes care of the transportation he takes care of employing people he's the best employer I are our values there are 40 50 something b corpse in new zealand there are we about have about three times as many bee corpses in new zealand as as australia does nationally and christchurch was the first and I would suggest that our front-facing organizations our christchurch nz look known not only at the financial value of businesses or the technology value of businesses but how we run our businesses it is the best attractor we can we can create it's the best wealth hook we can create in today's world I think I do believe that christchurch nz and the super nodes are doing a good job they're raising the profile of important business sectors but success in new zealand will not be about technology on its own but how we apply it for the good of humanity and I know this because I'm involved heavily in the tech industry in new zealand I've been a judge of the high tech awards for nearly 25 years nationally I've been part of the food and fibre challenge you name it I'm there will be those businesses who care who are great employers who care for the environment and also and and and society and care for the bottom line as well of course so in thinking about the long-term plan I'm also thinking about the climate change strategy and I'm thinking that businesses such as those who apply and obtain the b corp rating it's an international rating can lead by example faster than any it's a carrot not a stick and I believe we need carrots here not sticks our business community if our business community do embrace social environmental and financial values the impact will spread to the communities they serve faster than anything else that we can do by placing the design of caring businesses at the center of our planning we will more effectively bring together the minds we need to innovate and to mitigate the effects of climate change now for someone who's involved in technology involved and understands the aerospace space understands the food space it isn't just about technology once again I say it's about how we apply you thank you very much that's um an incredibly valuable submission because it raises the whole issue of how christchurch nz reaches out to increase uh you know sort of business opportunities here in in christchurch um has anyone got any questions yeah thank you um thanks for the submission I've never heard of the b corp so I've just had a quick block and it's really interesting I'm embarrassed but but I wonder whether obviously council's an organisation not not a company but in terms of our companies that we do have as a council do you think something we should be considering is how our companies can can look at that certification I do I do um better to demonstrate how it works as as leaders than to oblige other people to do it without testing it yourselves I think it's it's it's quite a process that you have to go through but you can step through it and it's good for business and all the people I know have set up b corps are doing better now in the states with steve ada it's open doors to him getting audiences that are unbelievable he wouldn't have got otherwise so I'm you know I think that it's time for christchurch to wake up to the fact that we have a reputation for holding on to values but we've not been able to articulate really and truly what those values are and and and build our businesses around them and this is the time I have to say that this is the work that I do I i teach businesses to do this but this is not about me this is about the big picture and I only work toward the big picture that's what gets me out of bed in the morning sorry james um yeah thanks for your submission it has um I've got to say that it's enlightened me so I was along with yani googling b corp as well after you mentioned it how many are there in christchurch uh you must have said it but I was no I didn't_''_8606.72 I couldn't find the in christchurch even the uh even the online learning development company that I work with doing online learning is a big corp so it applies to all sorts of companies if you can do it with making rubber gloves you can do it for anything really it's just how you approach it well as I say it's it was really enlightening and and I wish you all the best and I i think I don't know I'm trying to phrase this into a question did you do you realize that you've reminded me if not everyone else that we've got to think we've got to think of the future when we make these decisions that's what I think you've brought to the table as well today so thanks thank you I believe it I think oh aaron yeah um just at the start dorinda when you said about employing only people from canterbury uni what did you meet so you only employ people that have been to uni or if they're from a uni only canterbury no I at the I live and work around the corner from the university it's a relationship I value I do a lot of work um mba engineering across the university and a lot of mentoring volunteer mentoring I it's it's a it's a thing that challenges me I do it to challenge me right because with the britain institute and the dyslexic people and stuff and john only having gone to night school and things I thought you might be searching for those pockets of people that are genius but undeveloped underperforming that do you know what I mean like I do know what you mean I didn't choose to talk about that today it's another conversation um because those people are everywhere but usually untapped absolutely and I would love to talk to you about that because that's another thing that I'm working on is giving opportunities to dyslexic people bringing them into teams but that's another conversation I'm afraid thank you very much because that does wind us back to the connections between what we do as a council what other community does so thank you very much it's been a very enlightening submission thank you and I've overlooked derek roberts roberson robertson is it so I do apologise please come forward because your submission was out of sequence I was looking at my agenda rather than at the names on the submission so I do apologize apologies accepted thank you come forward I'm speaking uh in favor of retention of the warrenery pool in my opinion enrichment of community living to provide cohesion for all age groups is the key to a successful city particularly in a world nowadays where people in all countries are striving for an identity a stability and a meaning to their lives by closing waranui swimming pool and its gymnasium and other localized amenities the people who live nearby are lost for a meaning to their lives I'm thinking of the substantial health benefits many many kiwis derive from team and solo participation in swimming exercise in the side sports of canoeing life-saving etc it is all very well to say there will be a metro sports centre this can be as the city ever expands outwards closing warranty pool is very short-sighted for my part at age 81 and living in merivale I have swum at warren area on a regular basis since 1980 over 40 years and would like to continue to do so transport to warrenery my private car is easy for me but for many others to go into the city for a swim will not occur the guts will be ripped out of the ricketin area leaving young people with nowhere to go and worse still nothing to do except hang out in the shopping malls and for what it makes no sense to close warrenoi when the council is building or proposing to build additional pools including a pool in hornby costing many millions of dollars many areas of christchurch want new pools all will cost a lot of money expensive to run and a constant drain on the ratepayer why close warrenery when its amenities are so widely used by nearby schools for water confidence and swimming lessons water polo triathletes surf lifesavers para swimmers master swimmers exercise groups of all ages and kayak to swim over 110 years and produced 56 swimmers and water polo players who have represented new zealand overseas all this must count for something surely please leave the pool alone thank you madam chair thank you very much and um that's a perfectly timed submission as well very timely indeed thank you uh the next one is jim turpin thank since about the 1950s or the 1960s was the treasurer of the first world masters the world master swimming games oh my god my wife was on the committee yes she was with you that's right yeah my darling um good on you I actually you being witness to this on my closing bit what does that say save the waranui poll by now I'm saying that's awesome that's awesome it is what the club that would have to be the best demonstration of what the presentations have been about this morning than I've seen so well done that's you waiting to hear this one no it was it was you two connecting with each other you two connecting with each's amazing yeah well hello thank you very much um good morning you've no doubt had time to read and digest my recent supplementary submission as well as my original one so briefly so now so there's time for you to question me or tell me where I'm wrong don't know where there's only three minutes of this thing I'd like to just go over the two main things and just the headlines so you've got the time you'll have seen the veiled threat and you could and should reject the officer's proposal for the land drainage targeted rates on this alone it's not becoming this council to send out stuff that's got veiled threats on it amongst things there's also an equally and compelling reason to reject it though and that's because in support of its reasoning the proposal it mentions then completely ignores the original and continuing 100 benefit to those serviced by the land drainage rate and then promotes to unjustly penalize those who don't share any of that benefit and you may drainage there'd be no buildings and there'd be no rates and the officers said the it's targeted mainly for the central business and if you understand my note if I did it clearly enough on the economy that's how it gets back to other people like this what you're trying to understand charge so think about it our founding councils did and they were smart enough to put it in the right place and handle it fairly and properly so this council must reject that proposal from its offices and act to that please don't forget the other things that I've put in my things now you've got two minutes I hope to question me and tell me where I'm wrong um and then I'll say say the warren report again we've had a number of submissions on the on the subject matter I mean you've raised an an element uh of it in relation was that was that in relation to the the letter that was sent or was that my supplementary I decided when I had that perhaps the councillors hadn't read because it was a supplementary letter that went out on the 31st of march yeah related all you might say right yeah I've got it so I included that in my supplementary thing so that uh perhaps my submission made a little bit more sense will make more sense right okay I've got I haven't got the letter in front I said it's very biased it's it's in my view designed to confuse and obscure what it's trying to achieve and if someone doesn't look at it very closely there's a lot of words and lots of figures and misleading things in there um you never get through to some of it that's my view right so that's that's how you've taken the way that that has been written that's what it's yes that no that's not I take it that's what it says it actually says that doesn't say it's dismissed it it says well if we don't get this through we um we've got the policy to do it yet two pages earlier on they say they don't know what the policy is so they've got an undefined policy the officers I just think well you just stopped me I'm happy to sit down with anyone outside of this meeting if anyone wants me to go and try and clarify what I'm saying or I'm doing at any time if they'd like me to yeah okay um but there's two reasons that's one on its own that I read is that if the council does resolve to proceed with this change the targeted rate will be introduced over three years anyway that's right yeah sorry no I'm I'm I'm just I'm struggling to find the actual phrasing that's all and um if you'd like me to come up and show you I've got to copy the letter here too it's if you look at the thing that said that the main heading there's a covering letter then there's the proposal and of it I think it's alternative option two no change to existing land policy drains rating so that if we don't do the change today they say if we made no changes to the existing land drainage rating policy we would aim to change our practices and to come more in line with the policy key changes would be they would then move to consistently do what you haven't passed today that's a threat okay I i I i I if you just and they'll just do it on anything okay you gotta laugh on any property that's got a roof structure larger than a garden shed would you just about be any property in the world any property you've got so they're going to do it even if you don't pass it that's a threat no I i don't yeah I think it's um I mean the way that I read that was that it was I didn't read that as a threat I read that as a that was the other option that they looked explained to me I would read that a slightly different way but it look you've drawn it to our attention and I think that's the most important thing and um it is something that we will get advice on so thank you very much for bringing that to our attention there are a number of people who've submitted on the subject generically so I think we'll be looking at it very carefully yeah oh that's good well there are more reasons than just that too by the way no I understand that thank you thank you very much and save the waranui pool uh juliet hendry on behalf of generation zero jordan welcome to childhood apologies from my colleague elliot who wasn't able to make it today because his flatmate parked behind his car I would just first of all really like to acknowledge the time that you guys are giving us uh to speak on our submission I understand that the week that's just been in the week to come on the ccc strategy is probably a pretty busy week for you us um I'd really like to acknowledge the fact that the ltp isn't a pivotal time for both christchurch's growth and the next seven years we have before irreversible climate change and therefore generation zero takes uh our actions towards public transport very seriously and the whole aim at the moment is to try and make public transport attractive to current drivers not just acceptable to current drivers because that's not going to change people from single-use private cars that are convenient to get to work if it's just you know the bare minimum of what they expect and safety and fears all those kinds of things therefore we understand and appreciate so much your concern for lower income households in terms of the rates increases particularly when they're combined with uh ecan however we will want to reiterate that action now is an investment into the future so that you're not fixing mistakes in seven years time that we do not have the time to fix in particular we really want to make sure that your operational costs don't conflict with particular I want to draw attention to the rickett and bus lounges when I'm talking about this we did a quick submit for generation zero we received uh 228 responses most of them in favour of keeping the bus lounges for the two main reasons of safety both in from other people and from congestion on foot past especially when it comes to the e-scooter sort of situations that are happening at the moment um and also in an opportunity for an engaging entertaining bus travel trip you guys have the opportunity to make these lounges into something you know get get with the ministry of awesome and do some workshops in there or you know put some entertainment on make some brain engaging activities so that if it so happens that congestion makes your bus late or things like that people aren't upset about it because they have something to do and it's not you know the end of their day um I'd also like to just draw attention to the lack of bus stop access in the cbd that's kind of been lacking the cbd that are inaccessible without at least a two three block walk which simply isn't accessible for a lot of people with accessibility mobility issues and sometimes just not very attractive particularly in bad weather um I understand that there used to be a bus in the central business district before the earthquakes um and we recommend that either this being stated or you in state something quite similar to the timaru my way service that's being provided at the moment just in the central business district um we'd also like to draw attention to the other issue being as I mentioned before timings of the buses and a lot of this comes down to congestion so what we recommend and what I'll use an example of here is between morehouse and buchan street I think the two highways um on colombo where the sydney shops are what we recommend is having on peak bus lanes such as they have in mana in the in the north island um where between uh seven and nine am for example and between four and six pm uh into a bus lane so that the businesses that are nearby can still use the parks during the day but however the congestion particularly in between those two highways um because as a person who takes bus route number one to get to my house in cashmere it takes easily 25 minutes to get between that so it's it's often like quicker walking that distance and it is actually sitting on the bus after 5 pm um and so uh overall we'd just like to again really reiterate that we um appreciate your attention on um and your efforts towards trying to make this a really good public transport system um but we feel like it falls short of actions that will create tangible change to the lives of residents in terms of really wanting to make the switch to public transport rather than just doing it because they feel like they have to thank you thank you very much um right well look thank you very much that's the end of the submissions this morning that's right yes so thank you for being the and much appreciate your thoughts and very helpful thank you thank you very much now I'm going to adjourn this meeting to 9 30 a.m monday morning the 10th of may we'll see you then you
Uh juliet hendry on behalf of generation zero welcome no matter apologies from my colleague elliot who wasn't able to make it today because his flatmate parked behind his car um I would just first of all really like to acknowledge the time that you guys are giving us uh to speak on our submission I understand that the week that's just been in the week to come on the ccc strategy is probably a pretty busy week for you guys and I really appreciate the time that you give us um I'd really like to acknowledge the fact that the ltp isn't a pivotal time for both christchurch's growth and the next seven years we have before irreversible climate change and therefore generation zero takes uh our actions towards public transport very seriously and the whole aim at the moment is to try and make public transport attractive to current drivers not just acceptable to current drivers because that's not going to change people from single-use private cars that are convenient to get to work if it's just you know the bare those kinds of things therefore we understand and appreciate so much your concern for lower income households in terms of the rates increases particularly when they're combined with ecan however we want to reiterate that uh action now is an investment into the future so that you're not fixing mistakes in seven years time that we do not have the time to fix um in particular we really want to make sure that your operational costs don't conflict with the ltp values of having a livable city and in particular I want to draw attention to the ricketton bus lounges when I'm talking about this we did a quick submit for generation zero we received uh 228 responses most of them in favour of keeping the bus lounges for the two main reasons of safety both in from other people and from congestion on footpaths especially when it comes to the e-scooter sort of situations that are happening at the moment um and also in an opportunity for an engaging entertaining bus travel trip you guys have the opportunity to make these lounges into something you some workshops in there or you know put some entertainment on make some brain engaging activities so that if it so happens that congestion makes your bus late or things like that people aren't upset about it because they have something to do and it's not you know the end of their day um would also like to just uh draw attention to the lack of bus stop access in the cbd that's kind of been lacking since the uh earthquakes um there's a lot of spaces in the cbd um that are inaccessible without at least a two three block walk which simply isn't accessible for a lot of people with accessibility mobility issues and sometimes just not very attractive particularly in bad weather I understand that there used to be a bus in the central business district before the earthquakes and we recommend that either this being stated or you and state something quite similar to the timaru my way service that's being provided at the moment just in the central business district um we'd also like to draw attention to the buses and a lot of this comes down to congestion so what we recommend and what I'll use an example of here is between moorhouse and buchan street I think the two highways on colombo where the sydney shops are what we recommend is uh having on peak uh bus lanes such as they have in mana in the in the north island um where between uh seven and nine am for example and between four and six p.m uh those like uh the car parks that are there turn into a bus lane so that this the businesses that are nearby can still use the parks during the day but however the congestion particularly in between those two highways um because as a person who takes bus route number one to get to my house in kashmir um it takes easily 25 minutes to get between that so it's often like quicker walking that distance and it is actually sitting on the bus after 5 pm um and so uh overall we'd just like to again really reiterate that we um appreciate your attention on really good public transport system but we feel like it falls short of actions that will create tangible change to the lives of residents in terms of really wanting to make the switch to public transport rather than just doing it because they feel like they have to thank you thank you very much um right well look thank you very much that's the end of the submissions this morning that's right yes so thank you for being the the the last one to wrap things up for the day and um much appreciate your thoughts and um very helpful thank you thank you very much now I'm going to adjourn this meeting
Uh right I've got uh k page coming up next good morning I wish to express my concerns at the possible closing of the and metro lounges for safety reasons and for the fact that there's no uh seating available other than those initially I was not keen on the lounges but now I see the benefit of them especially if you have to wait up to half an hour for a bus currently there are eight buses that service these stops two of every ten minutes which covers the number three that goes to the airport every half hour the number five route is every 15 minutes with a half hourly destination to rolleston via templeton the other five routes are every half hour the pavement will become even more cluttered with potential passengers standing around with luggage walkers prams to go alongside e-scooters and the pack and save trolleys which are currently moved by the security staff with the congestion of the pavement how will the drivers be able to recognize who wants their bus as there are always someone heading to and from the mall buses unloading and loading passengers so what will be like what would it be like if everyone has to wait outside in the elements now that the buses are going to be all the same color except the orbiter it has made it more difficult for the visually impaired especially if they have to signal down every bus are you trying to discourage anyone from using the bus to ricketten because with no seating for the elderly and disabled who cannot stand for very long and the visually impaired will find it even more difficult to connect with the bus they want due to the congestion and obstructions I for one would not find it safe to use the stop should the lounges be closed the lounges provide somewhere safe to relax while waiting and also provides a place to get information for which bus which bus you wish to catch because they've got the timetables and they've also got a map showing the routes presently there are passengers who choose to change at rickard because they find it difficult and unsafe at the central station interchange in safe and healthy communities but closing the bus lounges and the foranui swimming pool would be the opposite thank you very much and it's actually really good to hear from somebody that utilises the particular service we've heard from a number of people oh I have I have to because I'm visually impaired but it's fantastic to hear from you and I just wanted to say thank you for coming and making the submission it's very very helpful indeed so thank you the
Do you want to come forward now is that okay because jim's not here yet I mean we're ahead of schedule a little bit so thank you and you've got two submissions the ltpn the climate change strategy is that right respectfully I think they are all one yeah and so I cannot price them no you don't need to price them apart but we'll just automatically throw it on to the six minute yes is that right or the no I've still got a limited time less than six minutes as I understand it recently oh yeah six minutes she's going to do three no no it says five minutes each yeah so 10 minutes yeah yeah so you're 10 minutes so free flow all right um thank you for the invitation today um I have had a look at um councillor sarah templeton and I had a conversation recently about aspirational business environment and she suggested I submit to the plan the long-term plan and the climate change strategy I my view is that they're both the same thing system and we need to create as I said an aspirational business environment that attracts a different kind of thinking to our music we need to celebrate our difference I think we feel that we're different in christchurch but we're not yet celebrating it and and taking advantage of it I want to thank you to think about placing social environmental and cultural as well as financial values at the core of business I think that tells our story better than merely pumping up business to be successful to help design robust businesses that embrace trade change and attract young people and if we're designing a city and I i take on board all of the long term plan planning and necessary actions that you must take to maintain and grow a city I do think if we look at the future generation they might want something a little different they might not require huge highways they might not require the things that we currently think are important so it's really we think about long-term planning we need to think about the next generation I spend employ students from the university of canterbury in my business the reason I do that is because they keep me clear and focused on the future I'm in my 70s so I could never do that alone and I'm aware of and I'd like to set an example for you and use a story that I really like to to tell and that is of new zealand's first bee corp and it started in christchurch do you know eagle protect did anyone know eagle protect uh it's worth following up actually if you're interested um steve ada set up a business to make not we used to call them rubber gloves but to make synthetic gloves that we all need and surgery and food production all of that and be a bee court now there's no harder task than that to be a b corp to do good in the world and create synthetic protective equipment he is now residing in the states his businesses run from christchurch he resides in the states and he is making it big time in the states that reflect who we are in christchurch and what we stand for and he's not the cheapest brandon on the planet but he takes care of the production values he takes care of the transportation he takes care of employing people he's the best employer I know of all of those things reflect what I believe are our values there are 40 50-something b corpse in new zealand there are we about have about three times as many b-corps in new zealand as as australia does nationally and christchurch was the first and I would suggest that our front-facing organizations our christchurch nz look known not only at the financial value of businesses or the technology value of businesses but how we run our businesses it is the best attractor we can we can create it's the best wealth hook we can create in today's world I think I do believe that christchurch nz and the super nodes are doing a good job they're raising the profile of important business sectors but success in new zealand will not be about technology on its own but I know this because I'm involved heavily in the tech industry in new zealand I've been a judge of the high tech awards for nearly 25 years nationally I've been part of the food and fibre challenge you name it I'm there um and and so I witnessed that that the winners will be those businesses who care who are great employers who care for the environment and also and and and society and care for the bottom line as well of course so in thinking about the long-term plan I'm also thinking about the climate change strategy and I'm thinking that businesses such as those who uh apply and obtain the b corp rating it's an international rating can lead by example faster than any it's a carrot not a stick and I believe we need carrots here not sticks our business community if our business community do embrace social environmental and financial values the impact will spread to the communities they serve faster than anything else that we can do by placing the design of caring businesses at the center minds we need to innovate and to mitigate the effects of climate change now for someone who's involved in technology involved and understands the aerospace space understands the food space it isn't just about technology once again I say it's about how we apply it and the values we that sit behind it thank you thank you very much that's um an incredibly valuable submission because it raises the whole issue of how christchurch nz reaches out to um increase uh you know sort of business opportunities here in in christchurch um has anyone got any questions yani thank you um thanks for the submission um I've never heard of the b corp so I've just hit a quick block and it's really interesting I'm embarrassed but I wonder whether obviously council's an organization not not a company but in terms of our companies that we do have as a council do you think something we should be considering is how our companies can can look at that certification I do I do um better to demonstrate how it works as without testing it yourselves I think it's it's it's quite a process that you have to go through but you can step through it and it's good for business and all the people I know have set up b corps are doing better now than they did beforehand and it's open doors and in the states with steve ada it's opened doors to him getting audiences that are unbelievable that he wouldn't have got otherwise so I'm you know I think that it's time for christchurch to wake up to the fact that we have a reputation for holding on to values but we've not been able to articulate really and truly what those values are and and and build our businesses around them and this is the time I have to say that this is the work that I do I i teach businesses to do this but this is not about me this is about the big picture and I only work toward the big picture that's what gets me out of bed in the morning james um I've got to say that it's enlightened me so I was along with yani googling b corp as well after you mentioned it how many are there in christchurch you must have said it but I was no I didn't I i couldn't find the numbers in christchurch but I know of at least six in christchurch um even the uh uh even the online learning development company that I work with doing online learning is a big corp so it applies to all sorts of companies if you can do it with making rubber gloves you can do it for anything really it's just how you approach it well as I say it's it was really enlightening and um and I wish you all the best and I i think I don't know I'm trying to phrase this into a question did you do you realize that you've reminded me if not everyone else that we've got to think we've got to think of the future when we make these decisions that's what I think you thank you I believe it I think uh aaron yeah um just at the start dorinda when you said about employing only people from canterbury uni what did you meet so you only employ people that have been to uni or if they're from a uni only canterbury no I at the moment I employ only students right undergraduates or postgraduates um I live and work around the corner from the university it's a relationship I value I do a lot of work mba engineering across the university and a lot of mentoring volunteer mentoring I it's it's a it's a thing that challenges me I do it to challenge me right because with the britain institute and the dyslexic people and stuff and john only having gone to night school and things I thought you might be searching for those pockets of people that are genius but undeveloped underperforming that do you know what I mean like I do know what you mean I didn't choose to talk about that today it's another conversation um most people are everywhere but usually untapped that because that's another thing that I'm working on is giving opportunities to dyslexic people right bringing them into teams but that's another conversation I'm afraid thank you very much because that does wind us back to the connections between what we do as a council what other agencies do and how that links them with what the community does so thank you very much it's been a very enlightening submission thank you and I've overlooked derek

Thank you uh howard dawson my submission is the 10-year plan should not include the decommissioning of the week of the photography swimming pool my submission is my own I'm not associated with the club other than the parent of a club member this pool this council exists as a creation of parliament through the local government act 2002 and that and in that act it states the council exists for specific purposes which include the promotion of the social well-being of communities in the present and for the future the following swimming pool is 100 years old and I expect that during most or all of that time it has been supported by the local government of the time and this must have been because it has been good to do so in the words of the act because it promoted community social well-being so what has changed now why is it proposed in the draft plan that the poor be decommissioned after a hundred years why is a good idea to support the pool not a good idea maybe it costs too much not so everything the cost but the quick the correct question is not what what is the cost but rather what is the cost benefit and the benefits are substantial indeed from spending something like two hundred thousand dollars a year at the latest count and a total council expenditure of more than one billion dollars per year spending this money on the pool achieves what the council is required to do maybe forunui is not needed with the new pools being built not so whatenui is a dedicated training and recreational facility no lazy river no toddler's beach and the facilities of foleonui of the of the following new kind are in fact in short supply I understand one christchurch swim club trains at three different venues because of the shortage of poor space and time yes para coyote will be a fantastic competition venue but consider this the crusaders will compete tonight at orange theory stadium but they train at rugby park that's their home maybe it's old and it doesn't look good yes it's older than the entertainment pools but it works really well at what we've only had one international games in christchurch and in 1974 swimmers from this pool won gold medals medals at those christchurch commonwealth games christchurch streets are named after these swimmers and a part of christchurch history will be lost if the swimming pool is closed not with this you for listening to me harirah thank you that was a perfectly timed submission so thank you very much thank you
The next one is alana james nice to see you yeah you too do I just go for it do I okay great um I'm here today to oppose the 75 proposed reduction in the evening tours at the christchurch art gallery now these tours are free they're 45 minutes long and they're led by volunteers like me there are 40 of us our services are totally free but why take a tour why not just wander around by yourself well I want to convince you that there's huge value in these tours and taking a tour an example the ralph hotery exhibition that's on right now if if you go into one of the rooms there in the exhibition you'll see there are paintings pretty much covered in numbers with the word sangro on some of them now I've seen uh visitors to the gallery without much background on hote or his art and they'll wander in there they'll have a look and then they'll just meander on out and they don't appear to have any significant connection because this is what they are told they are told when hotary was 11 years old his brother jack died in world war ii at the sangro the river in italy and the hotari family were poor none of that family could afford to go to the grave in the military cemetery where jack was buried but many years later when hotari was 31 he got himself there he got himself to the military cemetery he walked up and down the rows of tombstones of the young men of the maori battalion that were buried in that cemetery and he looked at the ages on the tombstones 19 20 21 22 and so on they were so young he took the ages on those tombstones and those are the numbers in his paintings and in one painting he formed the numbers into a huge cross and circled in the middle of that cross is the number 21 the age jack was his brother when he died beneath that huge cross is hotarI's own cross that was his symbol symbol for negation he was saying no to those deaths no I have led who have been riveted looking at those paintings when they hear that back story they connect with those paintings they have empathy with hotary his pain his loss his grief and it there's huge value added for them when they are on those tours and and they have those feelings and they make that connection and after the tours you can go to the visitors book you can read this for yourselves there are dozens and dozens of comments which basically say I got so much more out of the art by taking one of those tours so the point I'm making is the tours they add value they give people a much better experience not only of the art but of the art gallery and it would be very sad if we deprived hundreds of people a year of this excellent experience so I respectfully ask that the number of evening tours at the art gallery are maintained at their current level thank you thank you I've made the comment to um other submitters today that when people bring personal experience to the us so thank you very much thank you howard dawson
Well we'll wait we'll wait until the door's closed there's obviously been a lot of there's a lot of excitement one little person it's been a lot of excitement with the previous submission so um but we've been looking forward to yours too connor so if you want to fire off now kyotokoto we have three minutes to save the planet right as an ecologist I can tell you that business as usual is not going to save us it's not going to work we have to um achieve a lot in a short time ecological literacy and connection with nature will be a significant part of that to achieve well-being and to achieve a sense of place in history and to some extent this will displace the paradigm of the material expectations that we've had there's a whole lot of elements everything that I say from now on it seems might seem disparate but it's all connected I'll get on with it biodiversity equals identity protect all we've got and that's for the plants for is key to its survival extinction of experience leads to extinction of species there's a biosecurity nightmare out there we need more stitches and time habitat alone is not enough we need protected sanctuaries in order to support our charismatic endangered wildlife and for people to experience it and to add transformational value to the red zone and through the halo effect out through stepping stones to the wider city and across to the banks peninsula tui corridor all the heritage layers need to be reflected in the heart of our city not out the back out of sight out of mind we've got to get on with it and represent all of the layers of our rich historical tapestry within the heart of the city as for example a bush city in the cathedral square we also need to revisit the weaving of the symbols of the strength of the titity through the english and the and the natural and cultural heritage woven like strands of a rope down the central part of the avon otakuro river not just on the extremities you'll hear more about done it and I've had people on that trail telling me it's better than the great walks it's better than the el camino there's a people who've actually done it and have been there and been on those other trails we support like the estuary trust a dog free sanctuary with smart gates to keep out dogs that can't read even the godwits are happy with walkers at a safe distance as you can see in that and the walkers in the bush they're not along the edge of the estuary but the bush between the estuary and the um oxidation ponds out of sight of those sensitive wildlife we've just concluded the city nature challenge through inaturalist and we tick all the boxes you can see there in the graph we're way ahead of all the other cities in new zealand that entered and we're probably in the top 25 in the world out of 400 cities in the world that have recorded as many observations and species as they could within their cities the concept is a marketing up policies and actions within the city acknowledging the interdependence with nature it's very much a people nature centered concept in branding and marketing as I said for well-being and a slow eco-tourism for service industries and I just reiterate there without people there is no conservation respectful connection to nature is key to conservation ethic guardianship and kindness and we know all of the other issues and tensions with people a complicated diagram but you've seen it before it's an elevated visual pathways to all the natural and cultural diversity of our city embracing all of that rich diversity and pushing back hate as I heard mazaharudin syed ahmed exhort us yesterday with tears streaming down my eyes as I listen to him recount the terrible tragedy of the 15th of march but he is positive and I believe we can enact symbols like this that demonstrate that we are one and we are embracing all of our richness of both natural and cultural diversity one of the things uh key messages I wish to leave you with is the enormous amount of effort that volunteers and the danger of burnout fatigue and so on people are exhausted I'm pretty exhausted and to me the solution is not continual submissions year after year which for many may seem to go into a black hole um but to bring together people around the table from staff the centers of higher learning manufa and and the community able people who are concerned and especially often left out of those with an ecological mind I don't mean that we don't all have an ecological mind but we all perhaps there's a sense there's a there's a tendency to think oh we all know about the environment so why do we need a specialist you know we need more ecologists in that quadruple bottom line represented at the co-design co-creating table before decisions get made that then take enormous amount of energy and effort to unpick how do we pay for it all how do we develop this courageous and build on the courageous intelligent leadership that we already have well I believe we need to change the paradigm of what constitutes success these all of us and all of our cities and all of our region and our country we're in a privileged position in this part of the world we've got an opportunity to make a difference for the world we can be a leader we need to change the paradigm of what constitutes success we've got to stop feather betting and gold plating everything we can't afford it we need to be a destination province of long stay reflective echo heritage tourism with our story telling our narrative we need precautionary and accessible alternatives and transport urban sprawl on prime and land a whole host of things all of those things that are mentioned there there's talk about you know shrinking down you know council staff and shrinking down things we can't do this we need more staff we need more actions on the ground service actions that support the people of the city and I'm afraid to say the only way that that's likely to happen I've let I took into account your statement at the beginning that it is hard raised new points that haven't been raised by other submitters so I thought it was worth just allowing you to complete the submission so thank you very much for your time and contribution thank you
Uh the next submission is jan buckland good morning thank you for the time I'm speaking on the uh rural rates differential policy which is not a good policy as it has just one point of measurable criteria with the rest being subjective and contradictory which leaves it open to interpretation and results in inconsistent application and lack of transparency I sent an email to senior staff requesting the quantifiable criteria on points in the policy the response ignored the questions and used deflection tactics the questions I guess couldn't_''_39.52 be answered because they don't have the answers the policy uses terms like can't_''_44.399 be grazing a few stock must be farming can't_''_47.2 be commercial to me that's contradictory where does grazing become farming and where does farming become commercial the staff can refer us to uh dictionary meanings farming actually the dictionary meaning is the activity or business of growing crops or raising livestock it also uses terms of is more likely to be where say the presumption is tends more towards all very subjective currently you have cases of neighboring properties of 2k more a year and often has far more real farming activity happening how is that fair justifiable and equitable to all what tax service are they paying the extra for the use of aerial photographs google street view drive buys information from rate payers which isn't great for community spirit to determine and monitor classifications are merely a snapshot of a moment in time yet the logical option of zoning doesn't appear to carry much weight if the staff were able to hand on heart competently say rural properties are correctly classified 100 of the time that would take an enormous amount of staff time to implement a monitor which could be put to far better use elsewhere within the council why aren't more people speaking up about it they won't go public in fear of becoming a target as observations show is happening every rape power is entitled to know why they are rated as they are and if the staff aren't able to provide that then the policy is systemically flawed council I urge you to instigate some form of rate power that is clear measurable consistent and efficient in its application like the district plan community funding please don't reduce that as these organizers organizations pick up so much of what the council doesn't have the resources for there's a good opportunity for the time spent on drive-bys and looking at google earth and the rural sector fibre there are many properties that don't have fibre and cannot get an answer as to when or if it is likely to evaluate eventuate the programming of works could be done so much better thank you thank you very much so that sort of comes to the end of the time but uh a number of submitters have focused on some elements of the rural differential so it's obviously something that we'll be um looking at carefully as part of the ltp so thank you very much for your submission uh kiera foley and I think
And now we have the uh representatives of the faranui sports centre to um present and thank you very much for um undertaking the presente presentation in this manner uh it's really appreciated it's great to see so many young people here participating um and and this and you're going to see a lot of councillors taking pictures of you so if you just hang fire I'll take one from up here well thank you very much mayor and our councillors and we really appreciate giving us this time to talk about all things foreign I'm the president of uh foreign swim club and firstly I'd just like to introduce murray mcgurr here who's our club patron murray's been um catherine it's you know I know I'm sorry I'm sorry to I'm sorry to disappoint but um it's not appropriate for a counsellor that has to contribute to a decision with an open mind to actually participate in the just hand it back hand it back to somebody who's allowed here catherine thank you very much look yes I'm just going to introduce our murray um he's our club patron he's been with foreign for over 70 years and uh he's not much older than 70. so murray was keen to speak today but we've we've let him have a day off from speaking today um look we're here to represent two hundred thousand cantabrians who've learned to swim we're here to talk about the uh the legacy of the foreign army swim club and the many swimmers that have gone through it and just as importantly we're here to talk about all the community groups and schools that use farnelli on a regular basis um we've we've had over 45 submissions that we've submitted them and a lot of the history of foreign is in those submissions so we don't want to spend this valuable time going over a lot of the history and um the issues around that we would rather just focus on on the future and how we can work together to keep the pool open so the and and then what we'd like to do is focus on the future and uh on a way forward so and we've also got a couple of people would like to speak to the history of the club I mean the first pool was built in 1911 it was started it was called the coronation pool and um that started became the rocket and amateur swim club in the in the 1920s in the 1940s it became the foreign swing club and and that continues to grow it was they replaced the pool in the 1950s and then in the 1960s it was the first pool in the south island to get a cover and incidentally there was also a it was the first new zealand televised swimming event of a first live televised swimming event because it had had to celebrate getting a cover um the pools had a tremendous record of uh success from a swimming perspective we've had 56 of our um alumni who have represented new zealand at the world champs or the olympics or commonwealth games as well as thousands of national a lot of them a few of them are here today what happened as well in 1960 there was a the pool was always owned by um a trust that was formed in 1911 and in 1960 that trust was the pool was gifted to the the council on the condition that the pool in the land would always stay for the purposes of a swimming pool um and so that's something that we really want to see go forward in the future on that in terms of the um the community groups that the the the club looks after not only we have um five or six hundred learn to swim people coming through every week we have lot of competitive swimmers and a lot of them are here today so thank you very much everybody for coming along so it's wonderful to see you all supporting us we also have a lot of masters swimming swimmers going and some of us have been swimming doing the masters here for for nearly 50 years now I know it makes me a bit old 40 years we'll triathletes we also have some of the muslim groups coming first they love the privacy and we also have 22 schools that use it for various purposes and we also have special olympics the fair nash school for the death also come in and we also have um ts lessons and then which has been very popular and we've also got uh some tawakapura number groups that come in we have equis and also the stadiums used a lot as well so it really is um a fully utilized uh community asset and you know for example in february we had 22 000 people come on one day and in the month just using the pool or the the stadium so it's a a really you know useful well utilized asset um so on that what we'd like to do before we introduce a couple of our speakers um and then we'll hand over to dave to talk about our plans is we do have a petition here which has got over 5 000 signatures um for people who would like to keep the pool open but would like to have that as a table please so first of all we'd like just to have um from foreign school felicity ray would like to come and say a couple of words just about her involvement with the with the school kiara everyone um I'm a reasonably experienced teacher and I've been working at faranui school for over a decade now I have seen the value that faranui pool has given to so many of our students today I'd like to tell you the true story of a ten-year-old boy called daniel this story is daniel's but one that is not unique to our students daniel arrived in my class in 2016 as a his second day at school was when we started our week of daily swimming lessons at faranui pool his first lesson was the first time he had ever been in water deeper than his ankles daniel was naturally very nervous it took the five lessons just to get him to the stage of putting his shoulders under but I am proud to say that after multiple chances to and after another three blocks of swimming lessons in years six to eight daniel became a confident and competent swimmer without this opportunity daniel could have easily become one of new zealand's drowning statistics and without this opportunity right there many of our students could become one of new zealand's drowning statistics having furanui pool next door gives us our students skills and experiences that many simply cannot afford and that we as a school if required to travel for swimming lessons could not afford to provide our students either thank you I'd also just like to read out a letter from a lady called sue williams now sue's dad was doug kane who was involved with the club since the 1940s and throughout new zealand doug is known as mr swimming so I'd just like to read out a letter from sue who couldn't make it today good morning my name is sue williams I am the daughter of doug kane whose involvement with the foreign away swim club dates back to 1937. doug was elected club captain of foreign swim club new zealand as mr swimming and he was awarded an obe for his services to the community doug was involved in every fact facet of fire news growth and improvement of facilities for example heating and covering the pool by negotiation and fundraising doug's ability to raise funds was legendary his lucky splash tickets and housing nights in the wrecking community were time consuming but well worth worthwhile financially as we grew up it was natural for my brothers and me to be involved with foreign from a very early age under doug's guidance we learned to swim and often competed at foreign and inter-club competitions the forunui community was very proud when every single medal won by new zealand at the 1974 commonwealth games and all seven of them went to a swimmer from farani however it was doug's ambition that not only should the fauneri pool be used to try and compete with swimmers but also a little johnny and little mary should have the opportunity to learn to swim doug also thought other sectors of the community should should able to use the pool myriad of swim trophies that we give away every year and the two biggest and most sought after these little cups this big and they're given to the kids who try the hardest and you call the little johnny and the little mary crow so that that's a wonderful tribute to doug kane therefore as a family and alongside ferrari swift club committee foreign members in the wider new zealand swimming fraternity we are passionate and enthusiastic in our support for the frontier swim club the maintenance and operation the pool must continue not only for competitive swimming but for the myriad of community groups which use the pool now um you know that was really coming from uh survived because he'd be he'd be he's sitting down watching us um what we do with paul because he really was his he was it was his pool now what I'd like to do is to hand over to um david ormsby who's going to talk about the what we'd like to do for the future of the pool now david is a a huge involvement with the the pool and also his son tycho is one of the top swimmers in new zealand to carry the new zealand team so he's got a broad range of experiences um with uh with the pool so david chris um uh thanks chris um look it feels funny for me in my cultural paradigm to be doing to me after our president has already spoken but most importantly it is appropriate for me to do that and an honor for me to be selected on behalf of our club and our community to represent them here today as well I think probably the key thing for me in the club in terms of our deliberations has been the reflection of every member around this table on the many battles that you've had to fight with each other and amongst the group and in the community and if you haven't already the fights that you will be having to look after those small members of the community it is the small community that always needs the support so we're here today to process we realized we're a small part of this community up against a juggernaut called the council and it is rather scary for our community and probably a relative question as to why we haven't fronted up before on previous plans because it has been quite uh scary for our community and now we've decided it is time to step up and have a conversation so thank you for that and in that reflection I probably just have kind of googled a couple of things or thought about some things in my reality in christchurch city you know and how some of you have fought for the small guy and just recently thinking about phil and james there the two vigilantes over natanui digging a hole in a trench to create some drainage for that small community I mean I admire the the courage to step out and do that got a little bit freaked out that in turn you got a little bit of smack on the hand from some of the council bureaucracy but you stood up for that community I also want to acknowledge last 15 years I think I want to acknowledge your tireless work to look at to get the re-establishment edge we've pulled back up and running pool that was demolished after 73 years and the tireless week that still goes on and then so we offer our support as much as possible as we can there leon I do remember ahui that you and I attended in 2004 and I think you remember this one fondly where we had to attend a hui far together over its insolvency and trying to save it from for our community and uh what leanne did was what whipped out of the room had a five-minute conversation with the minister of finance and came back in and looked at me and said we've just decided that tapuni cooked he's going to pay off all the bills for this organisation and looked at me to make that happen look the outcome of that is that we do have an mri that still exists it's fraught with difficulty just like it's never been safe it's always been at risk and as well the outcome of that is a governance approach and a partnership that naha far has with this council and a mandatory position on the governance board of that mural and that goes back to its inception when the council provided the land for that pool and it's in a similar situation to this one when we go back to 1911 when the council was always there supporting this community and has never been not part of the partnership so we're really looking to help that as well and and amongst the swimming community as well there is it's well known amongst those in the in in the pool community that people like councillor yani there and the fight to make sure that a pool goes into limbwood a similar community to that that we've got in the small community of rickard and around the wadini pool because the social demographics in that area suggest that this community needs as much support as it can and community development only happens when they're involved in that and we're part of that community want to's just some examples of what we see going on so recognizing that our time is running out and I can go on forever and I was warned not to uh by the committee late last night when I got in off the plane we've got a number of recommendations here and happy to discuss those accordingly but we think that the council should have approved the retention of foreign pool pretty simple recommendation for this council given all the information that we've got and the information that we can debate and bring to the table for a a good conversation with staff on what what could be a better situation a better future for our community and we want that pool to be there for the continued use and enjoyment of the people of the area you know and we note that both farinui and metro can operate in a complementary manner not a competitive manner in order to service all of the communities that we live within we don't need to exist in a pool type environment which currently exists which is very competitive between community and we're happy to collaborate and cooperate complementarily accordingly I think the second recommendation that we've got is that we want to acknowledge the foresight of our predecessors that someone telling me to hurry up we want to acknowledge the foresight of our predecessors and those gone before us and recommitting to the 1960 deed of trust and recommit to an authentic partnership for the future and that is something that we can sit down and discuss and talk about to make it better it doesn't have to be what we've had today and it doesn't have to be what it looked like in 1960 it can be future focused for our not just for those who have come in the past but for those future mokopuna that will come in the future I think thirdly we want to recommend the re-establishment of the board of management has laid down in the trust deed and through that partnership we want to sit at the table with the council and the school and look at what that should be in the future and one of our local school and we can do a better job with everybody's help we think as part of that plan through this board of management once established they can go away with your membership and develop further what this partnership looks like and the solutions for the future given the time frame for metro to be opened we have time to find those solutions and we ask you to give us that time to achieve it so I'm going to finish the I do have a gift that I want to hand to leanne if that's okay can I give her a thing as well chris it's all paper we know that you all are scared so just to close leanne I've just handed you over 200 pages of your own archives relating to foreign pool and over 100 pages of new zealand archives from the forum school relating to the pool history as well I i wonder if we've just saved you ten thousand dollars of staff time um and photocopying which you could probably put aside to help us save this flash lawyers to go through the deed because we've got flash laws behind us that you can use for free in that sense but it is it is something that's important to us and special as as the future of our pool so on that I'll close with something that I was thinking about what does this mean to me the other day and it goes like and it goes for everyone behind me as well it said farinui is me and I am fading is our pool and our home and farinu is the whenua it doesn't walk and it can't move it has a history it has a whakapapa and we want to add to that for a mock upon the future kyoto okay I'd just like to say too you know um we've spent a lot of time analyzing the numbers and um researching things so we'd really like the opportunity to field some questions about what we want to do and if you've got any general questions please please use the time to ask them we just perhaps exploring that concept of partnership a little bit further about whether we can both bring something to the table is that what you've got in mind well then I think that's already started because we've got good communication and dialogue going with david bailey at the moment and david even sent a text this morning saying good luck so you know because we and that's been that's that's nice and we have been working on that and through the whole last few weeks you know in terms of understanding that getting the right numbers on the table uh we have sort of both agreed to work in a partnership with it clearly the their idea of partnership is that we the pool closes and we move somewhere else so we're trying to work together so that our obviously our options we can stay at the pool and work from there so I think that partnership model is definitely established and moving forward you think that there's a there's a model of partnership that could enable you to remain there just council providing and and you operating yes I mean I at the moment it's the council effectively manage the capital and do the capital expand and we do the operational side I mean I think in terms of all the pools in town we run a very lean model um three or four years ago we completely restructured and we've we've employed a general manager who runs it we've turned quite substantial loss into a good profit now so and we've also got a wonderful new head coach carl gordon who is running a wonderful program and our numbers are increasing I mean it hasn't helped that it's now out you know the pool may shut so that's the sooner we can sort of rectify that and get a way forward that will help with our numbers because there is some uncertainty out there yeah but um I i definitely david you had some good ideas on partnership too oh I suppose I'd put it down to something in my room wife reminds me of every day is that partnership'm always on the wrong side of that uh that that arrangement but more importantly if you look at the history of the water pool and the nature relationship between the council the school in foreign it has always been rocky and it always has been hard and it has required people to sit down and have difficult conversations and I think there's room for that to continue it's really a three-way partner of education that's right yeah so all of that is there and we're absolutely keen to ensure that we can cater for all of that okay uh catherine look can I thank you all so much for coming and speaking on this especially on a saturday uh morningslash afternoon we've had a number of verbal submissions over the last few days from individuals in our area as well it's just to emphasize on the support a few things that I wanted to ask one was actually about the partnership the second one was I understand paranoid pool is not just important to the community in rickerton in vodanoe but also the in a month um I spoke to junior general manager and I asked her about the statistics of where those 22 000 come from um is it justin ricketten or is it from the white of christchurch no it's the white of christchurch I mean I think one of the the real strength of foreign it's got a family atmosphere parking is um not a problem what it is at the moment because we're building a cycle line um so everyone will have to cycle there in future um but it's it's you know it is uh um it's it's going really well and so um yeah it's very positive isn't david you know I think as I said I use the word to work complementary to each other's we we provide services we think that are unique to other pools in christchurch and that shows with the number of families that travel from across town to fading who use the facility including families from schools that are actually on on sites with council pools and a lot of the very clean water I mean on a we're I think we're the only pool in christchurch that hasn't had a brown out in the last couple of years so for people who like clean water that's uh that's that's a positive um and I think what's important is for those that know clive power he's like the guru coach in new zealand and and he reminded me this time last year is what foreign has as a pool and a facility and a club is like no other in new zealand and it should be the envy of every club and swimming pool is the nature of the relationship it is with council and the facility and with that there's no reason why that club and that pool's not producing the best of everything worldwide and that is his dream and his challenge to us as is now that he's hidden there in retirement but I'd hate to think that we'd lose something that's been built over generations and he sees that as something that is a question my question is over the uh past 10 years your long history in the brilliant history and you have 200 000 people swim in this pool have any the two generation even the three generations like their parents grandparents swing in the same pool oh okay absolutely I mean yes we talked um murray for example I mean his grandchildren are some of them here today they've swum and all sorts of them in marlene grandchildren or wonderful that's all that's that's they're all still here and um they're wonderful stories and so it's been some exceptional you know the response we've had over the last months for people coming out of the woodwork to talk about their experiences and you know with forunui not just in for swimming and learning to swim but also you know life-changing um changes to them and and how it's made them much better people and it's given them an out for me I i work in the mighty community development space so things maori come naturally to me but non-maori spaces maori who've been at farinui over the generations is incredible it's just not as obvious as we think it might be but but from a maori perspective the whakapapa goes back a long way can we and and james will know we can talk about families like uh the pitama family swam there in the 1960s all national champions and their father was one of the coaches and they've got whanau that still swim at that pool now it's just an incredible whakapapa for all different community groups at that pool like no other and I think from another side as we can look at almost every other club in christchurch today that exists from a competitive experience perspective their whakapapa all comes back to starting at whakafatini okay thank you thank thank you thank you very much and I i think that um you know to have a a a whole community come collectively in order to offer this level of support um it does help us uh in terms of the decisions that we have in front of us so I want to thank presentation that you've made and this and the cheeky um haka there when in the background thank you very much appreciate it thank you very much thank you uh
Get back underway and I'll invite um case craig to uh make his dedication welcome madame mayor chief executive distinguished counsellors you can't say it but you know it's true heritage protection has been a contentious issue in christchurch regardless I wish to take this opportunity to commend the heritage team on their 2024 delivery package and a long term plan which includes repairs to the bridal path today I come to you not with the problem but a unique opportunity for our city to celebrate the bridal path if I could reach out and speak to my great great grandmother who is an early pioneer stood upon the summit of the bridal path overlooking the canterbury plains I would say I'm proud she came here to escape the famine in ireland I'm proud of the way she traversed the bridal path while pregnant and caring for a three-year-old toddler and I'm proud to be representing her pioneering spirit here today however when retracing her steps on the bridal path over summer I found it in a dilapidated condition graffiti on monuments overgrown with missing there is a need to prioritize the necessary bridal path restoration much earlier in the long term plan it is arguably the most important piece of heritage our city is responsible for by chronologically pre-dating restoration projects already underway in the central city the opportunity I present to you in this chamber today is to do something different and once in a christchurch city councillor's career christchurch has successfully won the bid to host season two of an exceptional event called sail gp on littleton harbour next year this is a huge coup for our city as season one attracted a global event audience of 1.8 billion across broadcast social media press and in venue audiences by restoring the bridal path in time for sale gp you can show off the surrounding area of the littleton heathcote sale course to a global audience and distinguish otahi christchurch on the international stage let's not disappoint australian fans who can finally travel here and could walk up the bridal path to spend money at the gondola between races imagine how sail gp this global sailing event links together with christchurch by boat the event can take on added meaning by effectively paying homage to our city's roots and is a quick win for you as councillors before your election campaigns kick off next year but importantly a vision like this is a win for the city the people and our heritage today I have outlined an opportunity to restore the bridal path for the pioneers in a timely and constructive manner for our city council and before fans arrive for sale gp next january using your position and influence together let's stand up and celebrate our ototahi christchurch pioneers this is why when reviewing the long-term plan I urge you to join me in the call for repairs to be scheduled to the bridal path earlier so we can honour our pioneers in time for sale gp because their way will always be the christchurch way and I for one choose to believe their pioneering spirit is calling you to take bold action here today thank you thank you it's um thank you it's a it was a very unique submission in our um list and linking it to sale gp uh I do think it does present an incredible opportunity so thank you very much for bringing it to our attention I'm sure it will um allow us to consider it it's good to see you thank you thank you very much for your time take care thanks now
Uh kiera foley and I think cora scotch and russia eerie as well from school strike for climate welcome there's only two of you um thank you for taking the time to hear us school striver clement ototahi is a group that focus on focuses on holding central and local government accountable on climate action and demanding demanding that funding and resources are allocated towards our client your climate strategy that reflect the fact that you have declared a climate emergency we think that many of the points made in the long term plan are good first steps however there are several areas we feel um where we feel more as needed we want to see a focus on providing green infrastructure particularly cycleways in the near future this would mean bringing forward funding forward and construction of the aventakahrut a palaho river route and southern lights routes if we are to mitigate climate change the transition to sustainable modes of transport needs to come soon and 2025 to 29 2029 is not good enough according to an nzta study 60 of non-cyclers show at least some openness to them older cycleways also need to be upgraded and many of the cycleways that we currently have are disjointed and stop with little to no warning transport is all about reaching a destination and if the city's cycleways aren't connected then they are not accessible therefore we support the local connections program but recommend that I have a particular focus on connecting students to their schools at the moment too many students feel unsafe biking and several people we know choose not to bike because they don't feel it safe according to the last census 50 percent of students travel to school by motor vehicle this is too many we also asked the single agency be created to oversee public transport in all its forms the current system is inefficient and has led to a lack of accountability over the city's public transport networks climate education for future generations is also important future generations need to grow up understanding the problems they will face we would like to see more funding available for climate education programs such as enviro schools librarians and libraries are also incredibly resources for both climate change and a whole host of other issues as a group we rely on services on these services and proposed changes will affect us we ask that you continue to fund libraries especially in rural or low socio economic areas we support the council's new plan to deal with waste particularly the focus on changing our throwaway culture as in a sustainable world it will not be possible to live the same high consumption lives that we do currently we also recommend that the council provide an incentive for businesses to pursue low waste options such as sustainable packaging for example for food and to encourage them to lower overall consumption change needs to come from the businesses that are providing services to communities and producing large amounts of rubbish without this leadership it is a greater challenge for individuals to lower their waste production further education about recycling and lowering waste would also be beneficial to communities we have also made a submission on the climate change strategy and once more demand that the funding and resources put towards this reflect the gravity of and though it is often spoken of as a challenge that our generation will face this is not entirely true we are not the ones with the power to act now at this time when action is vital you are and it is important that this is reflected in all your policies we will continue to hold you to account thank you is there are we willing to take questions yes no thank you um james great presentation thank you and it's good to see the younger people of christchurch coming and putting their views forward so my question is and I'm serious would you take the time to think about standing for council at some stage during this next long-term plan someone like vicky back who was the mayor for three terms here she was elected council at age 19. so that'll be within this next 10 years for you guys so good luck the question that's question um I think well everyone within our group has different aspirations and aims to make change in different ways obviously but there are definitely people within our a tangible change in that area great thank you hey it's a perfect answer thank you very much for um making the time and the effort to come in and I know that um when the group came there was a real sense that there was an immediacy wanted for answers and um and I asked you to come you know and you've come and I want to say thank you it makes a difference it makes a difference when you front up and um and put that in front of the whole council so thank you very much thank you is there a separate climate change submission that they're doing as well I don't know oh okay there is a different difference okay cool great thank you thank you uh right I've got
I've got richard ball um atlas body corporation and on behalf of a number of submitters welcome to uh my name's richard ball and I'm here today as the kawafaka hari or chair of the atlas quarter body corporate um and as uh mir dalzell just said also speaking on behalf of a number of other submitters uh from the atlas quarter the issue that I want to raise with you today is actually really really simple we pay a significant amount of rates for waste collection and we do not receive a service and this is continued for some time instead we are required to organise private collection and we pay for that through our body corporate levies so up on the screen is the atlas quarter for those of you who are not familiar with it uh it's in 36 well street it's a modern apartment block it's got 113 residential units in that one development and on the ground floor in wales street they're three commercial units it's high density by christchurch standards and it epitomizes the sort of central city revitalization the issue is that the council's solid waste regime and what I mean by regime is your your policies your bylaws your service contracts hasn't kept up with the reality on the ground for what's happening in the central city so in practical terms as I outlined that means we pay between three and four hundred dollars per unit per year for waste collection but the council does not provide that service to us instead we have to pay for it through our body corporate levies we think that's grossly unfair and it's certainly inconsistent with other developments and residential units across the other parts of the central city so what we're asking for is either provide a suitable service for this type of development or stop charging us and at this point our strong preference is to stop charging us because the system that we have arranged privately keeps is working for us and if you want to know more about that I'm happy to answer any questions about that the issue is not new we raised it in to be addressed in the ltp now I understand the ltp is a big long process and it was probably a little bit late to be included in that hence we're here today um but what we're told when I discussed it with a staff member in february was that council staff were looking to undertake a comprehensive review and over the next year and it will be addressed at some point in the future a recent conversation I had just in the last couple of weeks with someone else on this issue when I told them that they laughed and the reason they laughed was because they said that's what we were told in 2018. so there's already been a long time by which you can able to address it and it hasn't been so by all means undertake that comprehensive review and we know there's a whole lot of issues about waste and your vitals it is complicated does take time but just stop charging us in the meantime we've already paid over the last three years probably a thousand dollars and 113 thousand dollars so it's a significant amount of money and just to be clear on a few things we strongly support the council strategic objective of central city revitalization we've voted with our feet we live there we're advocates for it but we've been penalized for it and so that's what we want him to address we also strongly support your objectives of waste minimisation we provide all the same waste streams the council provides as well as some bins for corrugated cardboard recycling because they take a whole lot of space and we do that all at our own cost and it's not about not wanting to pay rates we're very happy to pay our fair share of rates and when I look at your ltp personally I think there's lots of great stuff in there I'd love to see something like the red zone be a haggly park of our generation that we can pass on to the future or I'd also like to see more money spent on things like banks peninsula pest control for support and I know other residents support so it's not just about that but the current situation is grossly unfair and inconsistent across the cbd so I'll just go through some slides and if I can hopefully this will work so first of all um to not charge us is very easy and some in the central city already have it that quote is from this little brochure here which I received with my rates last year a guide to my rates and as you'll see that's talking about the waste minimisation rate and it says central city properties do not pay this since they have a separate waste regime well guess what we're a central city we have a separate waste regime we do pay it but we receive nothing and that our line highlighted is from my waist from my rate spill it's only the waist minimization part of highlighted there the red bins I understand are paid for through general rates so it's not the full picture it's in terms of consistency across the central city that's looking on the other side at number 25 well street is a low density development there are I think six or seven residential units above commercial above some shops and they utilize the council's own uh waste stream no idea where they pay for it but they they do utilize the council service if we were to apply that to our development yeah and in fact that's only half of the bins so our street frontage is roughly twice the length but we would need to have 339 separate bins and put out 226 of them each week and they'll be in front of commercial units not against war like that so what we have instead is we have 12 bins and eight of those provide the same waste streams as the council bins and four of them are for corrugated cardboard and it's small and it's compact because it's all shared and it's right it covers all the same waste streams and it's paid for privately by our body corporate so just in summary the current charging we see is unfair it your strategic objectives of central city revitalization because we've been penalized for it and there's a clear mechanism to stop charging and if you want to undertake a comprehensive review go ahead but please stop charging us in the meantime thank you madame thank you very much I mean it's a very um graphic I love the fact that you overlaid the number of bins over it I'm a central city dweller as well live in a very small development apartment building over the road is the west fitzroy they also have the private service that you've described so um thank you and you've made it very clear it's one or the other yani um I just wanted to check has someone told you that you can't have the service or can you have the service if you choose to have it what people have told us is it requires a council policy decision to me the the key policy decision is probably your ltp in terms of the funding side of it there are operational policies that the council has on for a service yep if you as a resident ring up the council and said I want my three wheelie bins because I'm paying for the service are you told that you can't have it or could you have the three bins we could have the three bins but they're completely impractical yeah for our development I i I'm not to be honest I'm not sure because we we haven't asked for the three bins because it just doesn't work for the fact that we've got 340 we need 340 pins yeah no I get that but um yeah I mean this has been going on since 2015 so it's great that you've made the submission and there's been a lot of work done I don't know if it's public that we can share with you over potential options so just I guess to reassure you that there is a lot of work that's been done already um that came in december last year so yeah I don't know those reassurances is what we're there was a comment made that we're doing a comprehensive review and that people laugh because they were told that a year of a different matter it's not in relation to a very simple question which is pay for or provide yeah I can show you the report if you want all right thanks so much when it comes to the increasing number of high-density developments across um not just the central city but mostly it's interested in other places as well do you think it makes sense for council to have some sort of standardized collection system for those rather than everyone doing their individually over time but rather than each development doing maybe a slightly different thing over time yeah look I can understand that the council might want to ensure that if people are doing their own thing it's got to provide for the same waste streams yeah as part of your waste minimisation objectives and and we can understand that and support that one of the things that we the reason that we prefer uh to stop paying rates and organizing ourselves half of what we pay in rates because of the fact that it's consolidated down you know we're not collecting 226 each time the other thing is that it allows us because we've got a direct relationship with the provider if we want to change things around so for example last year we found that our cardboard recycling bins were overflowing so we just oh can we have another one and we're happy to pay with it when we first moved in there was no green bin so we said actually we want that so we asked for it so it provides for that sort of direct relationship which is probably fairly cumbersome to provide through the council as the organising party but if you're able to provide it we absolutely thanks so the key for you is that relationship where you can negotiate what is required within your development correct right james kiara richard uh great presentation and I've got to say what you're doing with your waist as a body corp is is admirable um are you happy to to tell about twenty thousand dollars a year spread amongst I spread among 113 residential households so that's probably about half of what we're paying in rates right okay and the other thing is that you've sold that you've made your point really really well I think you you're resonating with all of us um to the extent that I'm almost keen to live it atlas except except except that I know that I'd be living near john hutchison the world's not perfect but look if anyone wants to come and have a look around atlas I'm very happy to to show you around because I think it does epitomise the sort of development that the council's advocating for thank you very much for your presentation and and thank you for the um other residents that have entrusted you with the time to make the presentation I actually think it was a much better presentation for the additional time and the methodology that you um used and especially the graphics so thank you very much thank you
Uh raywin dawson children welcome good morning so I'm here as an individual and I want to talk first of all about your job and then about people in the city and then a little bit about me in that order so first of all I think from your point of view about the ricketton bus shelters is my topic um I think it's probably I suggest it's poor economics to close down something which costs so much to research and set up and is doing such an utterly brilliant job so everyone I've spoken to and I've never used it this is just as the christchurch citizen that I am speaking everyone says that it's warm and safe and clean and comfortable and if they didn't have it they would not use the bus so in fact if you close it down you are lessening your revenue from buses so good point to you as council other point to you as council on your website you say you have a passion I like this for building a better future congratulations I think a really strong building block for the future and I i recommend that you rethink that financial decision the people that I have interviewed and talked to about this they say it keeps hundreds of school children safe each day as you know ricketton is quite a dangerous street not because of school children basically I hope but because of the traffic in all directions at all speeds it also helps the elderly and the disabled keeps them warm and healthier and thus it saves you money in the hospital so I think that's that's a brilliant idea I've already mentioned the bus revenue just talking about myself very quickly I belong to the core disability group and to the disabled persons assembly I do not represent them with any authority I just belonged to them and I heard a lot of comments about people who didn't have the speaking experience that I have to get up and speak so that's why I'm speaking as an individual they were really concerned more than anything else in your financial area apart from the cold water lounges being closed so I wanted to represent them and say please rethink that decision and about me for 20 seconds I am a published writer and a speaker but I chose the rickerton bus lounges as my priority before the mobile bus all right so thank you very much um thank you it's much appreciated
Right sorry about that um wow uh donald derek thank you wow that's a heart actually I can't top that one at all but I do have to say that um I'm also here to speak in defense of keeping the funding for the maintenance of the faranui pool I moved into rickerton about four years ago bought a small house there and I go to the foreign center all the time I go to box fit two to three times a week I do yoga there once a week and I swim there as often as I can and I found already that it's much easier to swim during the summer months than the winter months because in the winter months I'm not good at sharing a lane with two or three other people and that's the only option that ends up being left at the swimming times for us and I know that the reasoning behind closing down um the the funding for maintenance of the farah pool is that there's a new center that's being built in the middle and I'm very grateful for that but the swimming needs in this city are multiples of what is already being provided and there's no way that this pool won't still be full all the time if it's kept open also while I have a good income I don't own a car and don't want to own a car to go out and swim I would basically have to get a car or losing quite a lot of time on mass transit I have a very busy life as a lecturer at the university and don't have that kind of time so I'd end up getting a car if I wanted to swim I don't want to use those resources and I don't want to pollute the environment in order to access the pool so I definitely stand in defense of the fair new way pool a side thing I also mentioned um I'm noticing that there's a thought about adding a new tax relation in relation to water use that tax in some ways makes sense to me's going to be based on household if you use a certain amount over which will be very hard on families in particular we have a lot of stresses on families in our society we don't do much in general to encourage people to have children it's basically an expense that people take on themselves it's very hard on them and I would like to support keeping on seeing wonderful families in my neighborhood that's it thank you um that's um does anyone have any questions I think it's it's very very helpful submission thank you very much thank you
Great thank you thank you right I've got uh k page coming up next good morning I wish to express my concerns at the possible closing of the record and metro lounges for safety reasons and for the fact that there's no uh seating available other than those initially I was not keen on the lounges but now I see the benefit of them especially if you have to wait up to half an hour for a bus currently there are eight buses that service these stops two of every ten minutes which covers the number three that goes to the airport every half hour the number five route is every 15 minutes with a half hourly destination to rolleston via templeton the other five routes are every half hour the pavement will become even more cluttered with potential passengers standing around with luggage walkers prams to go alongside e-scooters and the pack and save trolleys which are currently moved by the security staff with the congestion of the pavement how will the drivers be able to recognize who wants their bus as there are always someone heading difficult to negotiate with four buses unloading and loading passengers so what will be like what would it be like if everyone has to wait outside in the elements now that the buses are going to be all the same color except the orbiter it has made it more difficult for the visually impaired especially if they have to signal down every bus are you trying to discourage anyone from using the bus to ricketten because with no seating for the elderly and disabled who cannot stand for very long and the visually impaired will find it even more difficult to connect with the bus they want due to the congestion and obstructions I for one would not find it safe to use the stop should the lounges be closed the lounges provide somewhere safe to relax while waiting and also provides a place to get information for which bus which bus you wish to catch because they've got the timetables and they've also got a map showing the routes presently there are passengers who choose to change at rickard and because they find it difficult and unsafe state that you wish to create safe and healthy communities but closing the bus lounges and the foranui swimming pool would be the opposite thank you very much and it's actually really good to hear from somebody that utilizes the particular service we've heard from a number of people oh I have I have to because I'm visually impaired but it's fantastic to hear from you and I just wanted to say thank you for coming and making this submission it's very very helpful indeed so thank you the next one is k risden good morning madam chair councillors and residents may I take you on a trip to central rickett and show you what brings joy to our area it's wednesday not just another day the phone starts to ring who's up for it today we'll meet on the corner and let our feet do the walking while we do the talking on round the roads and what do we see a pothole sign missing rubbish dumped stream not flowing but don't worry we're on to it snap sand cafes which one we should support today because each one needs our help okay then it's on with a rush to the library bus with its height this is the highlight for a lot of us some arrived with walkers trolleys parts we chatter as we gather and go up the stairs to make a selection not for some the digital connection the browsing the fines what's this your book was great can I have it next oh what a bonus large text the rest this recipe was lovely and easy to bake and god bless jocelyn she brought the cake our old community library sadly all gone the connection community bond that gives so much pleasure this bus is a treasure let's walk down the road sun beating down or cold wind blowing rain bust lounge oh oh the difference it brings when you pop in the doors warmth comfort security somewhere to rest your aching feet keep the little ones close by your seat all of these tourist gifts the council wants us to feel now walk on to the pool don't worry won skills of determination reaching for goals team sports and perspiration all things we need to encourage in the young generation warranui is is like a mother that's nurtured us from the cradle to the grave she deserves to be saved central ricketten is called a hub population attire it's getting pumped to the brim and you want us to fit more in you want us for the amount of amenities I spoke of it's grim but these amenities make up the rim without them the wheel will fail I thank you for listening to my whale that was outstanding oh look we would love to have a copy of your submission please would you mind if we published it on newsline I just honestly think that's the best submission I've ever had in my life thank you right sorry about that um
Uh the next uh submission is sarah dunkley who's joining us by zoom the benefits of technology welcome thank you very much um yeah it's a pleasure to be talking to you all um and um yeah and to be able to put this on my shin thank you very much um now I um most of my submission was about the council plan to dispose of the property in diamond harbour the hunters road property um yes um now the only things that I was really concerned about was the um with the tracks and the um sort of reserved land that's there um now um I guess it's probably quite obvious to most people that the bits that have been planted by the local community and the tracks through those areas should be kept as reserve and as access but the one part that I wanted to emphasize was important to keep that might not be so obvious is the section of track between ngatiya road and the school which is actually um goes through grazed land um yeah and it's probably I track because it's the end bit before you get to the school so um a lot of kids would go through there to get to school yeah and I'm just a way of trying to retain that track um as part of the disposal process um yeah and the there was a couple of other things that I wanted to say as part of the submission as well um oh but and I also wanted to emphasize that um the other access ways to get to the school from the the top of waipapa avenue are not that good for um like for instance for my family we'd have to go all the way down to the main road which is a really long way or up to the um or up to the um gravel road which is actually quite direct but it's quite dangerous because it's narrow and there's no footpath yeah um yeah and and the other thing I wanted to say um was about the water metering um yes I think it's a really good thing to have the wanted to make sure that it wasn't going to discourage people from using cloth nappies um and I said this in my submission just because um it at the moment it like like you don't have to pay for the water um and it might actually make it it actually disincentifies people that are already using cloth nappies from using them just because of the cost um and whether there's a way to increase the limit if people apply for it if they're using cloth nappies or something yeah well thank you very much and uh I mean your submission is very helpful we've had a number of um submissions from across across the um the harbour and uh so that you've raised the specific issue of the track so that's good and um I don't think anyone else has raised the the cloth nappies one but um it's a very good point because of course we all do want to encourage um what our own mothers used back in the day before they were disposable nappies um filling our landfill appreciated thank you okay you're very welcome all the best thank you thank you thank you
Thank you thank you uh josh olds on behalf of the alpine presbytery preston's project jordan good morning good morning kia ora tato thank you for having me this morning it's good to be here um I'll keep things short just to allow for any q a at the end um my name's josh I'm here wearing two hats this morning I'm a preston's resident my family and I live in preston's park in marshland and I'm also here on behalf of alpine presbytery who are the governing body of the presbyterian church in this region I have a role uh that we call the preston's project based in prisons it's a community facing role effectively exploring what it means to be church and a brand new community such as preston's um both of those hats would lead me to have a vested interest in my community and one of the things you notice quite quickly in preston's is that there's no communal spaces there's nowhere for community groups together there's nowhere for community once a week in the north christchurch pigeon club which while we make it work it's definitely not ideal and there's a fair amount of um feather and poo sweeping every week but we make it work um effectively what I'm what I'm hoping to see is a partnership emerge an opportunity here for council and alpine presbytery to come together and establishing a community space and so what I'd love to see happen is some land made available by council potentially in say the marshland domain and for alpine presbytery to be responsible for funding some kind of a building whether it's a prefab or something like that that doesn't have to be permanent that would hopefully allow for community groups to to use the space but it would also make possible some of the things we are hoping to do in the community as well um yeah maybe I'll leave it there just to invite you to ask any questions that you might have um aaron yeah thank you for your presentation um the uh did you ever visit the was the sin albans transitional community facility which was like a prefab like a school prefab style with a couple of office spaces in a meeting room that you know maybe your international put it in there before we put the permanent one up yeah no I haven't but I've I've visited the shirley community trust which maybe have a similar setup yeah so that's right let's move there now yeah is that the style you're talking about just basic right okay just a roof right it's gonna be better than the pitching club yeah yeah okay okay it's just just good to know where people are setting their their goals yeah um excellent thank you james pauline I'm just wondering um which side of marshland road you're thinking of yeah I mean we we uh the the biggest space that seems to be available is in that marshland domain there on the um the side between preston's and mighty high road um no that's further up behind the news it's on the the preston's park mean I don't have any firm ideas as to where where it could go that just seems to be where there's some space possible right thank you I'll take phil as the local councillor thank you very much I'll I'll catch up with you outside that uh there is there is a ticket no I'll give you some contacts and stuff like that there is some work well in progress with the martian school trust who have sold their building down the road and we're in discussions with the developer that the cdl that did it the guy is very helpful and they're looking to build something and I'll show you a little picture that I've just drawn up great and um I'll put you in touch with um kelly barb's actually on I was going to ask about the martian hall because that's on the other side of martian road now they've sold it because it's old and naked yeah yeah they've got a handful well I didn't know so I'm of us so yeah thank you number one is it no it's a good thing it's a good thing thank you just a quick question from me thank you for your distribution have you approached the school there's a big new school there and are you able to access their space we have approached to school um the times that we were looking to use it weren't_''_266.72 we're going to work we run our preschool music group on a wednesday morning which obviously would collide with school activity um the sunday morning space is is already used by other community groups zumba classic kind of thing but yeah that'd be an ideal space it's a major development there too you know there's been a lot of lot of a lot of housing going there after the earthquake so yeah I'm told it's it's going to accommodate 12 000 people when it's all finished it's an amazing amazing development but yeah no it's good it's right to raise this and this is the right time to so thank you and I'm I'm sure that um phil pepper we catch up with you and um update you on what's going on with the local community up there as well thank you
Thank you thank you rosie belton welcome I'm just going to turn that around hello everyone I'm speaking in support of the proposed grant for capital grant for the arts center the christchurch arts centre buildings have featured in my life more than 50 years first in the late 60s as the canterbury university site which I attended as an undergraduate student and later as an arts tenant at what had become the art centre from the early 1980s through to 2009 I now along with other christchurch residents and visitors to the region am a frequent user of the art center site as a diner shopper concert goer and film viewer as well as just an ambler enjoying the beauty of the site this group of magnificent victorian gothic buildings are a treasure for us all in christchurch and canterbury residents and visitors from all parts of new zealand and other parts of the world when that starts happening again I urge you our mayor and deputy mayor and councillors to not only action this one-off grant of 5.5 million which will enable two more spaces to bring in more funds but also to look at ongoing annual funding to top up the running costs of this heritage gem of an asset to our city the art centre buildings and precincts survived the earthquakes 2010-2011 and have re-emerged over the past 10 years due to dedicated restoration to a majority of the buildings on site most of it funded by art center insurance settlements we the people of christchurch are fortunate recipients indeed of these beautiful buildings for our use through cultural commercial tenancies and recreational activities in the past the christchurch city council did give annual financial support to the running costs of this site some years ago this diminished and then disappeared altogether now I understood that when the the building was not being used during the time that it was being restored after the earthquakes but it's now back up and running and the ccc should be there to help support the ongoing running costs these heritage buildings my opinion there should never be anxiety about the financial viability of running this site for those who have the task of managing it it the running of such buildings between keeping rentals fair keeping buildings maintained and being able to cover the high insurances that are demanded for these heritage buildings there should and must be not only the payment of this one-off grant but an ongoing reasonable support which would demonstrate the commitment to and gratitude for such a gem in the heart of the city we must get the balance right about what public money is spent on in our city for future generations who have the right to enjoy these buildings and tenancies they house my view is the art centre should be seen as a shining example of what is good for people of our city and benefits it brings to we the rate that we the ratepayers should be in a small part supporting it thank you very much and again perfect timing covering off um obviously this most significant part of your submission which we've read and thank you very much for coming and speaking for the art centre thank you thank you fill former
Uh the next uh submission is uh bill swatto and bill carroll network of the islands trends I loved your pictures and your submission by the way we want more of this in elizabeth or none of this very good good morning thank you um so we're here to represent notice which is the network of the island stream and our society has been working over the last almost 20 years now in improving the amenity value of the stream for the local community and so this as part of the society there's bill carroll who's our chair and I'm bill swallow who's the secretary now we'd like to thank the mayor and the city council for this opportunity to comment on the long-term plan it's greatly appreciated and so what and where is the island stream it's uh one of the north west tributaries of the avon and is located mainly in the uh the waimaari ward now in common with other tributaries to the springs to to the avon the springs which supply the water have been drying up for this is depriving the streams of their lifeblood and degrading much of their immunity value it is an insidious process and doesn't always attract the attention it deserves so our local community has a wonderful potential asset in the island stream its beds and bank add contour and curves to a largely flat and rectangular part of the city so that's really quite important for us it provides a substantial green corridor of vegetation which doubles as an attractive and safe pathway for native birds in fact this time of the year it's absolutely wonderful to see the fan tales and listen to the bell birds an excellent part of it however our stream does have a split personality and if I can uh slide one yeah that's our stream on a good day that's flowing through uh avon head park when it's like that when it has a moderate flow of water it's an enchanting soothing babbling brook which is highly attractive to residents now in the next photo this is what it's like on a bad day when there's which is unattractive to virtually everyone and so the whole idea of notice is we want to get more of the first picture and none of the second one if we can now as part of our planning we have consulted extensively with neighbours friends of the stream including local businesses and sports clubs and also city council representatives the christchurch city council has done its part and come up with a good plan to augment the flow of the stream from a reliable source and the cost of doing this has been estimated at 130 000 and by way of comparison the rates contributed by the ymari ward alone are just slightly under 35 million dollars per annum now the finnelton why murray hereward community board has been an excellent sounding board for our society they've been very effective for probing the thinking behind our proposals to ensure that they deliver the benefits that we promise and also that they're cost effective they've also helped us in our consultation with both the community and the council so that's been really great and I guess after us in terms of the pro proposal I'm delighted to say that they made it their top priority uh for implementation so I feel that that's really important so just to sum up given the circumstances we strongly believe that augmentation of the island stream should be included as part of the city council's long long term plan the way that I think agree read your submission was that you know that we can talk about the flagship projects but these these projects are the ones that are the life and blood of the community yes it's during the lockdown where the stream flowed through some of the public parks particularly crosby park uh there was a track worn beside the stream just by the number of people that were using it for recreation and I guess a bit of mental health getting away from the house for a while so it is a great amenity for the community well thank you thank you for your submission thank you for what you do and thank you for working so collaboratively with your community board I think you
Of submissions so I'll invite mark todd to come forward thank you uh kia ora and good morning everybody uh for those of you who don't know me I'm mark todd um I am a recently retired trustee of the art center of christchurch I'm also a director of city care and a number of other public companies and I'm making a submission specifically about the arts centre on the basis of having recent retired and hoping to encourage you that the proposal to grant the monies for the completion of the event center are a no-brainer for the council uh on and if we go back sort of eight or ten years three key planks to the arts centre's generation of funds to support the arts and community activities at the centre the hotel and the event center the university and other core tenancies and the hospitality and retail tendencies at the centre itself so with the provision of the grant you will enable the bridging of the completion of the last of those three key planks I don't want to understate the art center have been as for use as a function of an event center for the people of christchurch the event center in the old court theatre will be a magnificent addition to that and I have no that but many of the people here and and and as councillors and your friends and colleagues will enjoy the pleasure of the using the event center for weddings um special events and the like so I'm just commending that but I also have another little lateral thing that I want to put to you as a recently retired and now able to be independent member of the arts centre board we have three major community assets the art gallery the arts centre and the museum and the robert mcdougall arts uh center right but with each other within one block of one another those three huge precincts of canterbury history and canterbury curated matters of I guess emotional attachment to all of us should work far more closely together they're physically close they have so many opportunities to share back office services simple things finance payroll hr background as an executive and one of the city's most successful enterprises where we ran everything for australasia for our business from this place makes it a no-brainer for me I've used that word twice apologies that you could actually as a we could as a city save the ratepayer or the public of christchurch hundreds of thousands of dollars a year if we took a shared services approach to those three facilities and we actually made some effort in the future to bring them together in a community type basis I mean it's just blindingly it's always been blindingly obvious to several members of our trust board that that's an opportunity so I'm just seating that as an opportunity for the future for all of you because you as the counselor the only entity here who can actually use leverage to see those three entities work together in the back of a sense and bring together probably the most attractive and closely linked set of community assets that we have that also have great opportunities in a business sense outwardly for visitors to seed that for the future thought and um I'm happy to take any questions if I've got any time to answer well no time for questions but I've just sort of indicated because um I mean it's a very good proposal suggestion that you're putting up and I'm seeing nods around the table certainly getting that response from next door from the chief executive so I think um that might be something worth exploring and if you're open for it I'm I'm sure that if somebody from the organization contacted you to help with that happy to help with that thank you very much thank you thank you thanks
Alrighty um yeah thank you for letting me speak uh further to my submission I want to expand on the detrimental impact of the airport operational noise contours that on property rights of landowners around the airport and why they must be reviewed and the 50 to 55 dba contour removed as background our family owned an undersized 1.4 hebrew lot in the 50 to 55 dba operational ice contour the family ownership extends back over 40 years we currently reside on the site under a temporary accommodation permit our site is fully serviced by power water sewer surrounded by residential residential dwellings undersized lots and is accessed by a residential driveway I support the fact that we do need operational contours for the airport so they can protect their ongoing uncurfewed operation however these are not currently accurate and need to be reviewed we were advised by council and the airport company during the district plan hearings in 2015 that the contour they needed to be reviewed likewise in our consent hearing in 2018 we were told that they were underway nearing completion and that the contours would reduce given notice by ccc compliance that our family must leave our land on 30 june 2021 as our permit expires we're only in this position because the inaccurate noise contours and the delays on the airport company if the compliance team were as efficient with dealing with the powerful as they are powerless we wouldn't be in the situation I don't I do not see the need for a 50 to 55 dba contour um we are currently going for a build consent on another site within this contour and there's no additional noise mitigation required on our build um it's purely this contour just seemed to be there at the for the enjoyment of the airport to control landowners for their own commercial gains so that is yeah just wanted to expand on my submission that I put in originally there thank you thank you I mean obviously oh well yeah I need to know the exact straight but I was just trying to figure out the kind of location of where you were uh we're on the meadowcroft lane of crofton road and we go through that residential and then we're just a block out the back so we can't use our land for rural use because we run kids over in the driveway if you take a truck or tractor down there so we were the only family that had a use for this property so so if you go memorial we have towards the airport we're between herewood and sawyer's arms oh yeah cool okay thanks aaron yeah good to see you again ron um the there's obviously hundreds of properties between your place and the airport and the runways anyway as you know just to let other people know you're not trying to build next to the runway but would it be a better plan if anyone building anything in the future signed a waiver that meant they could never that property could never ever have a claim against the airport company on noise that's what we offered in our consent hearing but we were told that council don't sign into non noise complaint waivers but then I had a consent on behalf of industrial owners where there's a residential use in industrial reserve so it seems that it's it's hard it's it's hard to see this fitting into the ltp process though so um I suspect it's an it's another process that we need to link you up with so yeah but sorry yeah it's just it's done it's an opportunity to come along and to present the issue and I'm not I'm not in any way undermining that and I'm pleased that you have chief executive sitting next to me she's got a note now so um we'll we'll follow that up done thanks very much thank you
Um I i haven't seen councillor coca is she and councillor two minutes away so um we'll just we'll just accept an apology for lateness from both of them would someone like to move it tim seconded pauline put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried now with declarations of interest again we're not making decisions we're listening to the submissions uh so um if you have an interest in any of the you know membership organizations or any of the um issues for any particular reason then just just simply state those but it doesn't stop you sitting at the table and we'll move on to hearing of submissions so I'll invite mark todd to come forward
Us thank you um diana shand dana you've got two submissions do you want to run them one to the other or do you want to sort of separate them I want to run them together yeah no that's fine so just put up six minutes yeah I'll reset it okay and thank you for this opportunity um I want to talk together with the two submissions together because everything is interrelated in the end and if you don't thread what you're doing for climate change into your city planning and think of it all the time really it's not as successful and it's not going to have the outcomes you want so yes it's all interrelated I might just say briefly that I was the national program manager for eckley I at the local governments for sustainability had the opportunity to look at europe and what they were doing there to make their cities more sustainable and you will notice in my uh submission I actually talk a great deal about transport and the need to address transport and rapid transport consider the amount of density that they have in their landscape considering that the um landscape is also full of open rural spaces and working farms to this day you have to say what is the key and it is the rapid transport that actually collects small communities in a major network and consequently I think we really have to consider if we want to address climate change emissions we want to address housing if we want to address a great number of things that rapid transport is going to be the key and therefore I would urge it as a priority and when you consider that housing needs can be met and there are so many people that actually I know who maintain either jewel houses in ashburton or timaru or somewhere like that and also a spot in christchurch it is actually uh I think a chance to actually free up quite a lot of housing and as well we have to consider that we are constantly expanding on to productive land which is it is a crime that makes my heart bleed I i do emphasize also a priority of rapid transport over the extended cycle waste now listening to the previous submission I'm a bit concerned that I have not got the research to say that older people would not be using those but I do travel out twice a week unfortunately by car to amberly to visit my sister who is in a nursing home and to that I i am constantly looking at the cycleways that line the highways and in the first week I was cheering because there seemed to be a lot of people out but that is not the trend now so I think people were trying those cycle ways and I do think that you actually have to look at where you're going to get the bang for your buck and that's in terms of getting commuters out of cars onto rapid transport and coming into the city so I would urge looking at that now the other thing I thought I might concentrate on in this few minutes I have is the need for looking at maintaining and enhancing heritage in this city we have lost when I was a student every great old victorian edwardian house had been utilized by students they were brought up by the clifford family um they all had rooms and things and a lot of them still exist and if you just want an example of where people that would not get housing in the new developments that we're getting now you only need to look at the corner of gloucester street and worcester bull of montreal street and worcester boulevard now that old house which used to be the university bookshop but before that was a family home had been housing eight people now because I live very close I talked to those people all the time as I went past and I would say these were people that are going to struggle to find homes having been ejected eight people had living in that house and some had been there for years maybe it was not up to standard and certainly it would be caught by the new tenancy requirements and that and that's why we need to keep heritage rants and keep on making sure are actually also doing a major social function and I really urge you to look at your decrease of heritage investment and heritage because it has multiple purposes I would recall that when I was involved in another branch of local government we did a study of what attracted men good management caliber to the city why did people come to the city from other cities in new zealand and take up major posts and a lot of them said it was because the heritage of the city the quality the culture which applies to other things that are in my submission about keeping library hours and arts art center um art gallery hours you've got to consider the ramifications of cutting those sort of things and heritage is the thing the quality and the character of heritage and character is very important in making an attractive city and you've got to keep that and think of the other purposes as well so there are many uh ramifications of those things and uh I just want you to think about them okay that's um that's very appreciated I like the way that you weed the two of them together and focused on those those core elements um in relation to uh rapid transit which fixes us all and and also the heritage component so thank you very much for your submission thank you
Submission all right we'll move on to the next one and that's the south brighton residents association submission good afternoon all of you I have to point out in in addition to jackie's submissions here that you know south brighton is one of these uh areas where we do not have a proper community house we've got a recycled one from the qe2 and then a building that was I was supposed to be demolished it was 10 of building code but it has been a lot of money has been poured into that but uh on to our submission seamus dina calto mayor councillors and so we're back to the the point raised in the previous submission partially but we won't ask you to comment the submission process for the long-term plan is certainly an example of democracy in action but unfortunately in the experience of south brighton residents association which we represent democracy in action for the christchurch city council is two words rather than three words because inaction has been the only response since 2010 uh sbra has been lobbying for almost 10 years without any meaningful response from the council so our question for you today to think about when you consider the long-term plan is on the screen if we can bring it up well I'll read it since we're having technical problems is is the council taking the submissions process seriously so um do you listen to what people actually say do you decide to take action or is it simply just um going through the motions and continuing with the plan that you had before the submissions process started so we're obviously not going to get the graphics the council technical side here it is here's a list of uh sbra and empower crashes meetings submissions deputations etc and with council since the earthquakes it excludes most of the correspondence and oia requests discussions with council at sbra meetings and as well as phone calls meetings and discussions with council funded organizations like the community board regenerate questions and the how team the cost of futures and the like okay on to the next one so in in parallel with our attempts to council has engaged in a series of initiatives but has still not addressed the problems of seismic risk land subsidence high groundwater and the assessment of the risk to life from a stop bank failure which is the biggest threat in our area the latter assessment was resolved by council on the 29th of august 2019 but the results have still not been made public this is risk to life you would think this was absolutely urgent but nothing has been done nothing has been made public since then and here are some of the key dates over the last years in our interactions with the council uh next slide that's one missing is it yeah next one up over here uh yes the next one yeah we're interested in seeing finding out what the long-term plan provisions are for the lower haven once again the area which is worst affected and subject to the stock banks is south brighton north of pritz street now it's categorized with lower haven instead of the south brighton and south shore area another confusion with the boundaries there is no intention is to delay the process even further can the risk to life at least be addressed as a matter of urgency the land drainers problems and the enhanced risks were caused by seismic events this situation is unlikely to improve given that further earthquakes are to be expected more than 10 years after the first earthquake these risks need to be carefully considered on the in the long-term this is the reality we are dealing with here there are stock banks there which were not in place before the earthquakes they are 1.2 meters high the difference between the tide level highest measured tide level and the land level is 98 centimeters last when it was measured the children come in much smaller sizes than 98 centimeters why is it that council just leaves this forever can you do something about this situation I offer you you know more information videos photographs all sorts of evidence if you want to go through this stuff but this is reality this is serious I really would like to see some action there is it too much to ask for no but that's in the nature of the submission that you've just presented so we've come to the end of the time allocated for the hearing today but thank you both very much for coming in and for presenting to us and we will respond in whatever way that we do in relation to the decisions that we make on the long-term plan so thank you very much thank you very much nice weekend
Uh fiona bennett how do I pull up my slideshow yeah that's me okay great uh tina kota uh thank you for having me here to speak to you um how do I do this there we go um so I'm demanding that you do more to tackle climate change so this is both an ltp submission and a climate change strategy submission combined um because the same issues come up in both uh I'm a regular bus user I cycle as much as I can I can't pull when I can't do either of those two things and we need to do more I'm not going to read out everything on that list because you can read for yourselves but um more must be done across the city and across the region I have submitted to ecan waimakariri and salwan as well and already spoken to two of them uh I would like to see lower speed limits on urban roads to make them safer so we don't have to put cycle weight on every single road every every road should be it's the users of that road and so if cars are going too fast it seemed it seems that it's too dangerous to bike on and so you just don't bike on it or you just don't bike anywhere um some other benefits of active transport we need to reduce congestion on our major roads we need to reduce congestion on our urban roads I've heard about uh the effect of people coming in from salwan all driving their vehicles not enough people on the buses and poor people in eddington are stuck with all these vehicles going through their suburb that used to be so lovely and quiet and obviously air pollution is a major issue as well I suffer from asthma and winter it's it's terrible with with all the vehicle emissions that I inhale while cycling some images from a friend of mine who has a camera strapped to his chest while he cycles because he's had so many accidents now that his insurance company won't believe him unless he's got footage so the one on the to a cycle lane so it's just a shoulder I get cut off here every single day just like this it's it's very scary uh the image on the right is herewood road where we are hopefully getting a cycle away um most of these are also huge road and it's the same kind of thing so vehicle vehicles they either don't know they're so close or they're intentionally trying to scare you um or they're intentionally using the cycle lane or unintentionally using the cycle lane it's just um negligence so this is why we need protected cycleways on major roads and and reduce speed limits so that it's less damage done once you are hit it's I'm I'm loving seeing the over 65 pluses especially using the cycleways I go out to rangiora on my bike a lot and the most common demographic is over 65s it's amazing I was going to say um here's uh city council's map of current infrastructure including cycle lane cycle ways uh shared paths etc western edge of the city that's where I live it's great not I'd like to see lots of connections into the existing christchurch northern corridor so connecting in preston subdivision connecting in marshland's connecting and northwood all these roads are very scary to bike on at the moment and some of the existing infrastructure that used to be on preston's road is now gone here's some lovely images to finish and any questions thank you very much questions uh tim um we've only got so much money but with regards to our cycle ways if for instance just to get the links in my area that there are concerns especially from parents that there are gaps between the bike lanes with regards to not needing the rolls royce or the gold plated but just say putting the wands down or in paint etc so we don't need to spend on the real concrete infrastructure but getting those delineations done just to train cyclists and car drivers would you be in favor of that absolutely the wands or flexi posts are fantastic I around the university are fantastic they definitely remind the drivers to stay out of your circle lane yeah and the ones around um like cashmere road and stuff exactly yeah great thank you very much for that james sorry I could ask the question again go on I think the answer will be the same yeah but thank you very much and um thanks for merging the two into the one submission very very effective thank you the next person is
Okay thank you very much so um hugo christensen empowered christchurch is he doing stuff oh he's doing both to see two separate ones obviously I'm not hugo christiansen but he's sitting beside me and this is paul smith um so I'm here to speak on behalf of empowered christchurch I've been a member of empowered christchurch since 2015. um so the question we've been asked in this um in this process is what's the right game plan for the ccc and so I'm noticing that equity is a word that's we've often used in the past has empowered christchurch with the council councillors and mayor and we're starting to note that this term is becoming popular in council publications so I guess the use of this term equity begs the question how exactly does ccc define equity so what does that term actually mean in your view so if we're going to use terms it's really important that we have definitions so if we think about equity we're probably thinking about equitable outcomes and our to survive and thrive is that a fair definition of equity it's not equality it's equity some people might need more to end up surviving and thriving council has an obligation to enable equitable outcomes for all residents in terms of funding capital works health and safety well-being and economic recovery this council's earthquake response has not met this obligation why were the worst affected areas left until last after the earthquakes and when will the areas where loss and hardship have actually become endemic when will these be prioritized by the council are the residents of these of these areas not important and is their economic well-being health and safety and their living conditions of no concern to this council so it occurs to me that in order to answer your initial question which is what's the right game plan I need an answer to another question a different question and that is what exactly is ccc's game plan your job please tell me how in the long term plan this council is ensuring an equitable outcome for all of the residents of this to you does anyone have any questions I mean we're here to listen to people's submissions so I don't think it's appropriate given that we're not we're not here to um to respond to questions we're here to listen to what people have to say so I'm sure you've got a view on um on how you think that we have responded to our own goals so I'd rather spend the time listening to you than individual counselors to express an opinion when we haven't actually signed off on the long-term plan yet okay so one example that I'd like to give of an inequitable outcome is the inequitable reinstatement of community centres across the city so this is an area where inequity is really obvious okay so can you comment on why some areas are getting their community centres reinstated I think you're misunderstanding the approach so the approach is is that um we want to hear from you if you feel that there are areas that have been um uh responded to an equity inequitable just gave you an example community centres okay well some have some people haven't got their community centre back such as 10 shelly road other areas are getting beautiful beautiful community centres so I'm the mount pleasant one for example fantastic yeah what about hornby they're getting one yep hornby is an example so where's the equity in that well it's I'm you're here to make a submission on the plan um and I mean it would be appropriate for you to comment on that not for counsellors to respond to you on an individual personal basis well I think I just have I think I've talked about inequitable outcomes all right is there anything else you'd like to quickly cover because we'll move on to the next submission
And so on uh eric jensen thank you hi I'm speaking here in regards to uh quarries and I'm aware that there have been a number of other people who have also put in submissions and though I'm sympathetic to what they have said because we have also been affected in the time that we since the earthquake we've had five quarries set up in and around our area but the thing that concerns me is that there seems to be almost an ad hoc approach to this I'm aware that the independent hearings commissions at the time was set up also partly in due to the fact that there was not going to be enough gravel to sustain and rebuild christchurch part of that is the fact that um the old west coast road was an allocated quarry zone um and there there'd be nothing else identified to it now dare I say it I believe that there's been a failure on part of the quarry association and also the city council to identify future land and the uh the associate the there would be no more gravel required irrespective of the earthquake because we also had the northern and the southern motorway which was on the books and that was going to be taken a huge amount of gravel but what has happened now is that we're finished up with an ad hoc approach to quarries popping up left right and center creating uncertainty for residents um so I've accepted the fact that we are effectively almost going to be pushed out of our area but what we are going to be left with is holes scattered all over the boundary or the outskirts of christchurch now what are we going to be doing with that that's my question um we're going to have these vast gaping holes either back filled with rubbish because at the end of the day it's concrete and whatever else that is backfilled into there and as I've said in my submission what sort of a legacy are we going to leave to our future generations and the sense of um we only need to look at the corner of old ashby's pit in there that had been backfilled that had to be then re cleaned out dug out and backfilled under a supervision of an engineer likewise to the one on the corner of avon head road and grays road and by the airport there so I suppose for me my question is what are we what is the council and it's planning endeavouring to look at um and how is it going to be planned out I have put a suggestion I've said suggested that to ecan staff and I've said it to even city council staff that I believe that the city grows as the cities grow that rollerston templeton and christchurch effectively will become one over due course how long how many years that takes who knows and we're going to be left with these gaping holes in between now we also know that there's not enough backfill to fill these holes and I think mr major can agree to that um and so I I've suggested to a few of them and I've been met with a know to look and identify a suitable bit of land that can be quarried out that then in future time years for the greater christchurch cell when um that that could be either turned into a lake for recreational use or could also be used for just other recreational uses so rather than this ad hoc approach that we actually plan ahead and I'm not you know for me it's not going to affect me but it will affect the next you know generations after us are we going to leave them with holes that they're going to have to dug out and re-fill again to uh to build on so thank you and I mean because of the variety of planning processes that were where we're involved in ltp isn't entirely relevant to the points that you're making because it's the bigger picture it's around the district plan we did actually try and find a suitable alternative land zone for quarries and in the christchurch boundary what you're saying is is that it should be a more greater christchurch overview with us collectively about what our future needs are and then thinking about what what the rehabilitation looks like afterwards all of these projects have rehabilitation requirements and you might be interested to know that fulton hogan actually appeared in front of the council yesterday and came up with a proposal which would see the development of a former quarry into an extraordinary park planted out a huge park um alongside residential so um and in a in many respects they're all starting to think that they can't leave things just as as as um pasture you know so um and if you think of the hallsville quarry park um that's a magnificent asset for the city so I think people are willing to have these conversations now but I think you're encouraging us to make sure that we've got the resources on budget to make sure that we can actually deliver the better outcomes than perhaps that were the the focus of the past and I think also the fact I think you know council has a requirement also to create certainty within residence you know out our way um yoldhurst and to salon and whatnot there is no certainty we tried to get a bigger buffer and we're not successful so um but I think that uh the only way that we can transition into a better future is to think about the thinking about needs in advance and planning for it in advance as you suggest so I think it's been a very helpful submission thank you okay thank you very much so hugo
You everyone if I could invite um murray smith thank you yoda welcome thank you um thanks for hearing me and uh apologies uh I didn't realize it was uh yourself made amir and the full crowd and I would have printed more than nine copies of my submission apologies for that we all have them electronically okay yeah okay um I believe the council should be brave enough to increase the rates by the amount required and not fiddle around with using levies here and there my provisos for this statement are the council needs to make full use of debt funding to improve our infrastructure and to me this is more than we've done before interests are all-time low and I believe debt loading should be over the lifespan of infrastructure and this could be over a 75-year period not shortened time frames frames as are currently used don't sell council assets for example keep the ownership of the airport as I see any short-term gain of sale so these sort of assets are only at the expense of future rate pose and user levies behaviors for example water is a core function of the council therefore using it as a way to raise more rates I believe is a very poor idea one reason for this could be we call ourselves a garden city we won't be if all the gardens dry up but an even larger reason is even though water levees may work in other cities where water is a short supply it will only enrage the residents of christchurch as a drive in any direction outside the city limits and you'll see massive irrigators pumping out millions of liters of water for free in fact christchurch has over 65 of the irrigated land in christchurch in new zealand one reason I believe the public would be so strongly against water levy out of a dairy link newsletter I preside given these facts uh reference papers the canterbury farmers use 4.4 billion cubic litres of water a year from our own crusher city website I've worked out the average resident uses 81 cubic meters of water a year so just pretend that we use this irrigation water for the to use the same amount of water currently used by canterbury farmers 4.4 billion divided by 81 gives a population of christchurch of about 54 million people so the 0.6 is not to get at the farmers but the question is around the logic of why would people of christchurch pay for a levy for water when there is enough water for free being used used outside the city limits to grow christchurch by 136 times why would the council want this battle in closing my number one issue is I want chemicals out of that like chlorine out of my water supply but to use debt funding heavier than previously before and to be brave enough to increase the rates by the level required without fancy accounting or user charges to create a lot more public scrutiny and drive unexpected behaviours thank you very much you just covered that often and the time allocated and really appreciate that thank you very much thank you thank you rosie belton
Um welcome ah thank you kia dakota everybody um my name is hamish fehrberg and I am the regional manager for conservation volunteers new zealand I'm very grateful for this opportunity to talk to my submission thank you I'm also grateful for the seed funding that we received back in 2017 for us to reestablish our presence in order tahi post earthquakes cbnz conservation volunteers new zealand is a nationwide community focused charitable trust that was established in 2006. we have three staff in aututahi our current funding comes from rada foundation through local volunteer engagement christchurch city council unkind contribution for paterson households will cry quarry which is where we have our office which we're very grateful for environment canterbury for supporting the arthas pass wildlife trust and the department of conservation community fund where we are planting forty thousand carcatea and cranford basin this is in partnership with christchurch city council and trees for canterbury we also receive some funding through whakaura healthy harbour which is for delivery days conservation volunteers new zealand manages a national employment pathways program called conservation work skills and this is a 12-week program where participants gain skills qualifications work experience pastoral care we value this output at around about one hundred thousand dollars per program and we have delivered five of these to date in christchurch therefore have contributed half a million dollars to local conservation since 2018 in oretah alone we have managed 24 000 mahi or volunteer hours and we have planted 35 000 trees much of this work has been done in christchurch city council parks and reserves where we are supporting rangers and staff this is a very solid return of investment for christchurch city council in return free of charge we have delivered four unsafe hands workshops engaging with approximately 40 community groups park staff valued at around about 12 000 dollars cvn zed would like to see future long-term funding for christchurch city council community partnerships team with a continuation of the community partnerships coordinator and programs and partnerships ranger these two roles have assisted us with organising events publicity and comms connecting with groups providing additional support at large planting events plus helping us with equipment these include cranford basin again where the slide there we go so that photo was taken just last week at cranford basin with a corporate group um world rivers day on the opao ho and spay dating which happened at victoria park on valentine's day we've also worked with christchurch city council rangers uh organizing a planting with pride day and we also have a million metres project which is happening on wadadapa stream in jelly park cbnz has a strong connection with whakaropoul littleton harbour and supports various conservation groups and organizations with their projects whakalopo has a unique landscape with high biodiversity values whakaropo has a uni um so I'm repeating myself here conservation volunteers new zealand would like to see long-term support through whakaura healthy harbour to support these groups we are planting trees dealing to invasive pest plants and predators we are protecting tangle species this mahi supports waka aura healthy harbour management plan and with whakaora funding today we have delivered 72 mahi days or days of work supporting the likes of rapaki schools in the harbour orton bradley living springs bank's peninsula conservation trust various reserve kamehameha nature application with ngati feki in living springs and if successful with his application we require support from christchurch city council staff this is a huge opportunity not only for biodiversity within the harbour but also for the local community will further complement this work thank you that's um can I do one more we can do one more okay this no no and and we've been I'm sorry I'll keep it succinct not thirsty tired tired thank you cvnz has a partnership with rotary we manage a planting program forests of peace and remembrance under this partnership we are looking to plant 50 000 trees in the darlington landing of the red zone we have support from christchurch city council staff and community we have trees allocated plus a plan we have confirmed funding of 130 000 from rotary and 100 000 through a work skills program and potentially a department of conservation jobs for nature workforce we have applied twice for a temporary licence we however we seem to be going around on circles our objective is to obtain a two-year temporary license coupled with a letter of agreement or mou to support long-term planting and maintenance we have a fast approaching rotary deadline by the end of may though we are not asking for preferential treatment failure to get an agreement would likely mean loss of funding from rotary and msd which would be a great disappointment and a lost opportunity I suspect we don't own the land yet so it may be that there's a conversation that we have to take into another another environment can you drop me an email please with the specifics I would love to yeah because this isn't the route to do it just pick up the phone and I'll talk with linz yeah yeah thank you very much okay thank you very much okay okay uh eric
Uh catherine bates can I use your slides bates I'm here to do a submission individually not of my capacity as a the project leave for the head of harbor in whakarapu or for the o pawaho heathcote river network which I'm also a part of however my submissions do cover those two things um first of all I'd just like to cover um my general submissions around the inclusion of rural areas within the city's council jurisdiction and I get the feeling from the work that I've been doing that it's largely missed out those rural areas are part of the christchurch city council these days and I don't see a lot of maintenance and infrastructure spend there there's a particularly around water and water supplies and also road cuttings and road maintenance um so you've got a strategic priority of ensuring a high quality drinking water supply that's safe and sustainable yet you expect these rural land owners to supply their own water um so they they have to largely fend for themselves and in terms of infrastructure do but it's become apparent that perhaps the time has passed for areas that come under the jurisdiction or city council that they still be allowed to do this um not so much allowed but you know there should be some uh capacity within the city council infrastructure budget to reticulate these areas especially in whakarapu and banks peninsula in general um it's not just about the clean water for those people but it's an environmental impact there's a huge impact on individual water takes on very seasonable water supplies a lot of this is up to ecan to the police but it would be really useful if the city council would include at least whakaropoul in the reticulated water supply network um you know if you included it in that as well as the surge network um which actually currently stops at sort of the governor's bay and next right next door to a bunch of people they have to get their own water supply you would achieve both a safe and sustainable part of that strategic priority really easily for me working in of those dreams are dry completely I mean as I know it's been a very dry summer very dry couple of years but we need to do something about it and this is one way that that can be helped secondly road cuttings um I work with private land owners and there are some really badly designed culverts that are increasing the sediment load into the harbour and I'm really keen on seeing those being dealt to in a well a good environmental manner oh my god am I already up geez that goes fast um and also I would like to see into my capacity opal heathcote river network to see more urban park ranches funded there cannot just be two or three of these people they are an incredible resource for the city and for those community groups um I just want to add you need to increase your operational budget for that places like the avenue takara corridor are reliant on the big spending spend on these things as well as the opa wahoo heathco river network uh river sorry the climate crisis I'm small spend on climate change mitigation and looking at redesign of things I know that the city council have a working group working towards this with co in terms of coastal design but I would like to see more as part of the disposal surplus city council owned properties please do not get rid of sam and morgan's gullies from your portfolio those are really important areas uh in terms of erosion and it's increasing sediment load into the harbour if the city council gives those up in terms but for private ownership then there's a big there's going to be huge issues in future and I think they need to be put aside as reserves and only reserves thank you very much thank you you've gone over time there so I'll just flick a question through just yeah sorry sorry yeah thank you okay any questions hamish fear bin again
Pronounce your name correctly when you come back sorry mark here good afternoon councillors I'm here today as a resident of the greater christchurch but someone is a metro bus user regardless of any other roles you may know me from this is my personal submission but its views are supported by others in our community when I say we in our I mean in the larger sense of myself my family my community and our greater christchurch community I hope that we want we need a reduction in the number of single occupant vehicle trips in our takiwa I'm sure we can all agree on that the provision of attractive infrastructure encourages people to choose public transport over personal transport the wrecking bus lounges encourage people to choose to bust from salon to christchurch and back to shelwyn with a 30 minute service frequency people need somewhere to wait for their next bus I bust today at a considerable cost in time because I choose to bus I acknowledge the budgetary constraints you are faced with however closing the record in lounges will make busing less attractive us want or desire I commend my submission for your consideration thank you mike thanks mark for this just one question if actually frequency was addressed and there wasn't half an hour waits and actually the buses will come in at much quicker intervals would that would you still need to have a bus lounge in written in it's still it's an attractive part of the system people don't want to wait as has been suggested me or you can wait in the mall I don't want to wait in the mall by the time I get to the bus lounge I've done whatever business I want to do in the mall I've been to sweat to ecan on the metro bus system recent changes have not made it better the um the proposals for the next five years offered very little for someone this takes away another little chips away at it your council has continuously criticized selwyn for the volume of traffic that it sends into christchurch this will contribute to that so you can't have it both ways it make it any more attractive mike if it was 15 minutes quick on that frequency like less than 10 minutes you still have to wait in rickett road in the winter to catch your bus okay thanks and it takes me it was 45 minutes from rolston just to wreck it in the bus I can drive there and back in that time if you want me to use the bus the system has to be attractive very good I think you've made your point thank you very much mark good to see you and good to see you contributing constructively to our ltp process thank you um ryan tear sorry now
All right um haley uh guglietta ava no takaro or takaro ltp submission sorry maybe you've got the climate change submission as well do you want to do them two separately or do you want this one I've kind of weaved it through the other merge them together okay give me 10 minutes yeah go for it thank you network and I've got peter beck here with me today and sierra butterfield who's our secretary treasurer and basically general dogs bully really um in a really good way um you guys must have had a huge week it must be feeling fairly tired so I'm going to keep it as quick as I can I promise the submission obviously hopefully has been read and I have seen this week lots of other submissions from other groups uh relating to the otakuro avon river corridor and the theme seemed seem to be generally the same and we support the submissions from the other groups in what they're saying to you so I really just want to focus on some some key things that are really and and how they relate to this long-term plan um so as you heard from celia yesterday from greening the red zone the stock banking is seems to us to be quite a a big issue um and I just want to reiterate that the stock banks are critical to this regeneration plan and it undermines the plan if there's no money set aside the whole point is to regenerate the area and let the river flow naturally we also fear that if there's no budget for these stock banks that the work will get done in in the easy picking areas rather than the areas that actually need it and there are communities that are sitting there at high risk of a flood incident although of late we've had no rain but hopefully at some stage we will so if we if we don't prioritize that work um you know do we want to be responsible for that those communities and those communities have already been hit hard enough in the last 10 years so we're asking really to look seriously at making sure work um these it's really been a challenge for us with these budgets um the line items at a at a very high level which makes it really difficult for us to give you an accurate submission we understand why that is because the work only has just started and the quantity surveying and the design of these infrastructure works but it does make it really tricky so you know um you've put together this awesome team of redzone people they're really a fantastic bunch of humans so far we've found them to be enthusiastic knowledgeable and willing to get in boots and all with the communities if we don't provide funding to allow this team to do that work then in the resources to walk alongside the communities to do this work engage with nature and implement plans then I feel like we're going to lose that enthusiasm so these guys will essentially just become lawnmowers and rubbish pickers for the next four years so we are asking at the very least for the line item for the avenattica river corridor of parks high level is the work around supporting the infrastructure that needs to take place we're asking that perhaps even the first year 2024 money be spread from 21 right through to enable these guys to you know do the work that they've been hired to do um I had planned on requesting that resources be put in place to enable a person or persons with the right expertise knowledge to carry out the work required to bring the co-governance conversation together however I see from submissions yesterday and the mayor's report for next week that there is going to be an update on this and we are very grateful that this seems to be underway with the regen legislation coming to a close in june and the land titles still not being transferred from linz this is a really time of limbo and to ensure that we don't lose all of this really good energy that surrounds the space we really need strong leadership to control the tempo and to display transparency as we progress through if I can be so bold as to say that in this long-term plan the regeneration of the ivan otakuro river corridor is the only one that hits the bull's eye in the proposed climate change policy this policy that we fundamentally support but feel is not worth the paper it is written on if it is a separate document sitting on a shelf somewhere if we are calling a climate change emergency these policies must be part of the strategic framework at the very least and at the very best it must be part and parcel of every decision budget project customer interaction and purchase that comes out of this building it it really needs to be taken seriously and we must have more measures put in place around it so just recently I've been part of the walking festival and which is has been a great success so I encourage you to keep that going next year so I did a few walks in the avon otakuro space and most of the people that came on the walks came from outside of east christchurch and I was really surprised by the lack of understanding about the so we know I've seen and read some of the other submissions from other parts of the city asking for their project at the expense of the regeneration plan it concerns me that if they held the knowledge that the regeneration plan is for the benefit of the whole city then perhaps they might not make those choices yes is nice to haves in this project eden project's looking fantastic the rowing proposal you've seen is coming along really well and is exciting and it's for the benefit of all of christchurch the climate change academy is for the benefit of everybody as well but what underpins everything is this opportunity to regenerate the river and restore mohingakai every person dwelling business car naughty dog walker and enthusiastic duck feeder are contributing to the destruction of our waterways every ward in the city has storm water they have a stream that's either visible or invisible that ends up in the hapaho hithket the takara avon and finally the estuary it's the whole city's responsibility to ensure the health of our waterways and re-establishing we can do this and let's not forget that 500 homes nearly 20 000 people were displaced in order for this city to do this work so let's honor their sacrifice and invest in getting the work done for the benefit of the whole city not just east christchurch and leave a legacy for the future generations okay I'm sad thank you very well um could I just because I mean it's always been a bit of a frustration uh from well a sort of outsider coming in perspective about the sort of different silos you know so um if we were to take a more holistic approach to the funding arrangement so uh some colleagues would have heard me say single activity management plan for otakuro avon river corridor that would pick up transport it would pick up stormwater it would pick up infrastructure that has to come up without the infrastructure that needs to go in um would that would that be something that would be easier for the community to engage with I to be fair after you know listening and reading these um team the staff about this about how we can better communicate what this means to everybody so perhaps combining that may well do certainly in a regular news bulletin packs coming out that that that updates people on on all of the projects and not just council projects but actually what the community is doing as well quite possibly that's a good idea yeah having better comms around it yeah because I think it's become lost and I think a lot of people outside of who who are passionate about this project and outside of east christchurch uh it's kind of sticky hearing about it first but they're not really grasping what it means for the for the whole city and we really need to communicate that and that's why this has been a struggle for our groups in the analyzing the budgets because they are separated into different places and it's really hard to figure out you know it might be better to tell a bigger story publicly because I mean everyone will benefit this is the legacy project I i fundamentally know this isn't yeah sarah thank you so much so sort of back to the beginning the the one thing that you see underpinning the ability for the rest of the river corridor to be used is that getting the stop bank sorted what I what I was saying was is that we we're all looking at the nice stuff the fluffy stuff yeah cool projects but actually what is the most important thing is the stock banking work in the green screen and yeah in the green spine the other stuff is a bonus and some of it's really fantastic but getting the stop banks means that we can then proceed with the other stuff with certainty and those kind of things absolutely thank you if I could just chip in there if the stock banks are well planned then the planting can proceed on the stock banks so the whole stock bank becomes a riverside forest whatever wetland that works but you can't plant until the stock banks are appropriately contoured yep all right well thank you very much I think that's an give in this space thank you catherine
Thank you uh sarah kerr hello hello I'm here to talk about the bus lounges because I am actually relying fairly reliant actually completely reliant on the buses because I can't drive so to have somewhere that is safe and warm and dry to go is a really good thing recently it was pouring with rain I have I have to stand and wait for the bus so to have that bus down to get out and get out of the weather and in the dry is quite good especially being in the being in the wheelchair because sitting in a wheelchair you just you get very wet very quickly because you can't keep moving around and I have other friends who are disabled in certain ways like I have a friend in a mobility scooter so when the bus lounges there her and I can get in out of the cold and because she's just sitting doing nothing whereas other people can move around she gets very cold very quickly and I also have a friend who has a stoma so if she if she all so having them there is a very good thing and again people people who are blind or or have difficulty seeing or hearing if they can if they've got people around them and screens they can see or be told when the bus is coming like my my my dad he has a sight condition so if he's standing inside the bus round she can hear okay the sumner bus is coming in three minutes thank you thank you very much and um yeah that's very um powerful submission does anyone have any questions no I think you you've really really covered it off um very well did you did you have a question sorry did I miss you I just say um thanks so much for coming in sarah so sometimes we hear um from people that we need to um not worry about some public transport so much because disabled people don't use them those kind of things I i use the buses every day yeah the bus I am completely and totally reliant on the buses yeah because I can't's often busy or she's too tired because she's got a health condition as well so I need to be independent that's great and are the other um sort of public transport infrastructure improvements that you could see um rather than just yeah possib this is probably a ear can thing but the seat belts on the buses if they could possibly go up higher because if you're in a wheelchair trying to get a seat belt through the wheels it's really nearly impossible so if you could do it like maybe just maybe if you could do it over your lap or something yeah that makes sense so it's dead there's some way to raise up the level of the seat belt because I don't use the seat belt because I've had too many too many instances of bus drivers forgetting where I am so I tend to sort of have I've had it actually I actually have one instance where I actually literally got catapulted out of the chair and ended up on the other side of the and I couldn't hold it I couldn't hold it okay thanks so much thank you thank you we'll pass that one on to um environment canterbury thank you right um hayley guglietta ava no taco or taco ltp submission
Creative spaces um kamorton akira koto um I'm here on behalf of our mental health and arts community we have four key points one is the importance of activating toy ototahi the christchurch arts strategy two properties for disposal we desperately need premises three strengthening communities funding please don't cut it and for christchurch art gallery don't cut their budget so um toyota tahi high order or health is one of the four pro of the art strategy and we really think christchurch has got the potential to lead the country in arts and health the strategy to implement it it needs bold action and it needs leadership from council we have some fabulous staff within council I'm proposing that we also need a budget to support the implementation of that strategy we are activating it ourselves we are developing a relationship with pegasus health and looking at arts on prescription but we do believe the council has a critical role to play one of the key ways that the council can activate the art strategy is providing space for arts organizations who need it so way outgrown our premises the phillipstown hub lease ends at the end of this year and we've received nearly half a million dollars investment through the ministry of culture and heritage we can't use any of that on-premises and we need a home base to operate from so our vision is for a center of creative well-being in christchurch um a place for um both creativity to uh for the community and a place to support the arts and mental health or arts and health sector in christchurch there's a lot of other people operating in this space um the cso working with people with dementia canterburyness choir sakurabu carving center the orchard drug um and so on so we have lots of friends and relations imagine bringing them together under one space and five rolleston ave would be the perfect place to do this um within the botanic space of the botanical gardens the art gallery and the art centre um so really we asked we asked to have a conversation about that um when you're ready um strengthening oh thank you um strengthening communities very generous contribution we receive for core operating costs we disagree with it being reduced we understand that there's been a review and that there was to be consultation and we think that that hasn't yet been made public we look forward to that because we do think that it could be more strategic and more targeted and potentially there could be arts and health funding ring fenced within that fund with christchurch art gallery we have a very good relationship with them we disagree with the cuts that are proposed to public programs we also think that there is the potential for the art gallery to partner with organizations like ours so that the art gallery is available and accessible to more diverse communities so a museum's on prescription type partnership will increase the diversity of people who visit the gallery recently we took a group there and one person a maori woman in her 50s who'd lived in christchurch for 30 years had never been to the gallery she said I didn't think there was anything there for me coming on a group she will and she will go back and um visit herselves so we have begun a conversation with the gallery about this and we uh yeah we believe there's a a really important role for cultural institutions like the gallery to play with the well-being of people of christ church thank you thank you questions sarah oh thank you um and have you talked to um you've talked to a range of different organizations potentially about working together for in roston house is that right we've started those conversations um I would say they're at the early stages but there's definitely a desire to build a stronger network between um arts and health organizations in christchurch and being co-located were to really help that yeah and so you'd like us to take it off the sale list and have a conversation yes yeah these things yeah and if there are any other premises we um didn't have a really good look before we made our short submission about the other premises up for disposal so if there are any other ideally centrally located of central similar one you know it's probably premature to say take it off the list it's it's actually establishing whether it's an appropriate um venue and I think that's why we can facilitate that conversation ahead of our consideration of the ltp so we'll definitely do that and what you're saying is is that are there any others other properties that could be considered in that context as well yeah good all right thank you very much littleton historical
Uh sarah anderson president of the executive committee friends of christchurch art gallery hi hello I'm feeling slightly schizophrenic because I'm back again that's all right but I have got my president we all have many roles yes busy lives yeah so for this submission I'm representing the nearly a thousand strong membership that we have with friends um and just wanting to draw your attention to the um proposal to cut both the level of service that the gallery provides to schools that's the education program by 25 and the cut back to the late night in public well the 25 cut back to public programming um so essentially I mean I'm sure you've I'm not going to read out the submission because I'm sure you've all read it but I'd just like to talk about the the what a gallery does and um and draw your attention to the to the fact that galleries are not static spaces that it may be that some people think that you go into a gallery and a gallery is just paintings on the wall or you've got a few sculptures sitting around on pedestals but actually that's not what a gallery is a gallery is a very dynamic space and our gallery works very hard to to actually engage with the public through lots of different events programs value added things that actually educate people about what they're looking at but also just um bring people into that broader conversation about art both it's historical context it's it the way it reflects our local community and also the international community in the wider world and I think it's particularly the gallery since the earthquakes has really shown how important that engagement is they ran all the outer space spaces programs um they have worked incredibly hard at engaging with the public and in this covert environment they have been able to really showcase our local talent and um you know the fact that we can't bring in international exhibitions um has meant that the gallery has had to really focus on its own collection and on what's happening in atera and of exhibitions that we have been phenomenal so I think that all of that public programming that goes on that's what brings the audience in if you that people I think just left to their own devices things think that galleries are this very rarefied space but in fact they're not and when we have these wonderful events that the gallery puts on the nighttime events the events that involve music the events that involve performance the events that involve food the night markets all those things that gets a really wide audience and you get all kinds of people coming in and then you get them going up into the gallery spaces and really looking at the work and I've been at those events and I've you know wandered through these the crowded foyer and then I've gone into the galleries thinking oh well nobody will be in the galleries and the galleries are full and they're full of all kinds of different people looking at all kinds of different work up there and having conversations about it and that's fantastic but public programming and with the education side of it it's building that relationship with galleries from a very early age makes them a comfortable place for people to go and you know kids and kids are bringing their parents in and it becomes much more of a family thing but I also think we're building our audience of the future and our creators of the future and it all adds value to the city and I really can't say much more I don't think so if anybody's got any questions they'd like to ask me a little bit more time any questions thanks sarah thanks for your passion um I am you know we talk a lot about well-being and and what you know what an art gallery brings in terms of well-being but have you ever done any work on the economic well-being of having people coming in and enjoying an art gallery I haven't personally but are there other studies that I would I would think there would be studies out there but I'm not personally familiar with them I i would certainly um think that in if you're thinking and an economic value in terms of that you know that the value of volunteers and the value all the hidden stuff that we don't put a monetary value on specifically because we don't necessarily have to pay for it it would be huge yeah and I think from if you're talking about well-being mental well-being it'll be huge yeah very good all right thank you very much thank you
Uh philippa watson good afternoon um first of all I'd like to compliment the council for having this chance to speak and I think it's great to have the planning process and for everybody to have a chance to put submissions in and speak and my submission is to recommend have lights put in at the corner where it's actually three corners of three roads that meet at the junction of limoudev the north end of limounev and wooden road and havenside drive because occasionally I drop off for children at school at linwood college at otakuro and it was very difficult to cross that um from coming from limadev and crossing wooden road over inside drive corner and also coming back from the other side and and I I've heard somebody suggest a roundabout but I don't know how if that would actually help or not because I know that around about you you when you give way to to our right in new zealand and um when I grow up limwood have what I find it is avonside drive and wooden road is to your ride so you'd be waiting a long long time for for your chance to go and I think if we had lights installed it would give everybody a fair process of actually having time to stop give way and everybody having a chance to go and get across that junction and and it would also be safer for cyclists and pedestrians because when I am waiting for my turn to cross with my car occasionally because I sometimes I go across and um see teachers at school but also if I'm not stopping if I've just dropped ellen would have and let the children out and then they go over the road and they I see children not just my children but other children going to linwood college um from limwade coming from norway but also from wooden road oversight drive quarter and they they have to wait and give way um to lots of traffic and if there were lights installed it would make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists and for cars and I think it would be safer for everybody thank you along with the the the issue and um and and we'll refer that on to staff and see what what they come back with because um I know the intersection very very well linwood isn't destined to remain there very much longer I don't think no so that that may release the pressure on the road but I think people driving too fast is yes I know but it's not going to be quite the same with cars I would assume but anyway but look thank you very much for drawing it to our attention it's a it's a project that's not on our ltp at the moment you've asked us to have a look at it so thank you very much for doing that okay and thank you very much for listening thank you
Uh next we have tim tim said mr timothy thank you good afternoon councillors most of you seen me before I think um you won't believe this but this is the sixth time now so um here we go again my submission uh to this year's long-term plan is exactly the same as in previous years for the council to retain it in accordance with the terms of my grandfather's gift of the gallery to the citizens of christchurch for the display of the city's historical collection which is virtually no longer displayed to the public in the christchurch art gallery as you know successive councils ever since 2003 have put it to one side for the future use of the museum to be incorporated into a future development plan in 2005 they proposed their first one in which they wanted to put their murray warrior on top of the gallery's roof to be attached to a square steel box to act as an ablution block so people could sleep in the worry overnight this plan fortunately failed to be consented due to the damage own buildings as well as the gallery this was a bizarre idea as I can't imagine any museum anywhere in the world unless their visitors sleep overnight due to the fire risk it has taken them another 15 years to propose this next plan which I believe is even more bizarre you won't like hearing this probably but that's my view this time they wish to excavate the entire land area of both the museum and the gatorade sites now the gallery site is 42 percent of the museum's land area to construct a single level basement to store all their collections many of which they wish to bring back from off site storage in the process they wish to demolish the galleries workshop back entrance canaday wing and all its basements and their heritage fabric they wish to base isolate all their buildings including the gallery but unlike the christchurch art gallery their collections will not be protected by the base isolation as they will be stored in the basement which will be a fixed structure in the ground the christchurch art gallery stores the isolated building and of course their basement is the car park but what is bizarre is that the basement structure will go 4.5 metres into the ground and as the water table in roston avenue is only 2.5 metres below the ground level the bottom two metres of the basement will sit in water so the collections will actually be stored under the water table I challenge you to find a museum anywhere in the world that has ever deliberately built storage for their collections beneath the water table let alone in the 21st century needless to say this is extremely risky due to the likely 75 recently announced it said 50 75 chance the alpine fault rapture in the next 50 years and the possibility of climate change causing sea level rises or anything up to two meters over the next century leading to water table shallowing in the cbd I can't see how you can possibly consent this project that clearly it contributes goal two of your draft climate change strategy and also the ministry for the environment guidelines the gallery has its own storage basements which 70 years that are well above the water table as the gallery is built on a sandy silt ridge which is one meter higher than the museum land it would be crazy to destroy them after 19 years this bizarre proposal is the last straw the council should decide now to honor the gift and retain the gallery for the city's historical collection most of which should be returned to the mcdougall for storage not all of it but most of it this will solve the storage problems of the christchurch art gallery which they have just confirmed to you in the in this long-term plan and which I've told you about over the last six years and it will follow what other cities around the world have done with their old galleries thank you perfect timing absolutely three minutes time to perfection thank you that's um very much appreciated thank you
Submission thank you oh thank you thank you thank you esther valero me esther we had you down for an individual submission but I can see you're representing a group so we're just putting five minutes on the clock if that's all right okay do I need to do something here oh no it's happening um ester valero and all of us we are here to talk about tennison street uh how we can share the road safely it's a street that goes across two of the awards um I don't remember the current name of the words uh beckham and uh I'll let tim scandred say your voice yeah um for some of you that have listened to this already many times apologies but we'll be back until you can fix it we all either live in beckenham or suddenum our kids go to school in one of the various preschools or kindies or primary schools in the area met as chair of bikini te kuro puroto board and yeah that says so we talked about it many times uh still here um initially individuals talk to staff about it and then it didn't really change much so we started asking collectively to the neighborhood the last responses came yesterday in the first ones in 2016 so that says um people cross people who responded crossed the road a lot that's the people um the majority of people that responded crossed the road with one or more children so that's almost 80 percent of the people who responded cross the road with children we know that children cross the road by themselves and this is the reason why we're here people mostly cross on foot or with kids on bikes or pushing a prime this is the reason why we're here the majority of people that responded to the survey and the reason why we've been talking about this for a long time is that most of us have seen an accident have been involved in an accident or a near miss or have had a negative experience this information is available to staff we will not go into details but as you can so you have a lot of material to learn about how that crossing that straight wig and the last two are how many um how safe do you feel the majority responded that they felt a bit unsafe or very unsafe or a bit safe and very few people said that they feel safe so these are children going to school the majority is children going to school parents going to school with their children we don't want people to arrive at school or a kindy or to work stressed out because they've rested an accident on the way all our schools encourage active transport we've got wheels only wednesdays so that's really a collective effort not to drive on wednesdays but really in general we all encourage the kids to to walk to school people move to the areas to because there's a variety of schools so that they're able to walk and the yellow and the grain are people who now the green is people who wanted a change and the yellow is the people who've suggested the change so only are happy with denison street as they are and these are examples and one of them is liz's daughter who sent her own submission to you which we presented to the community board in 2017 or 18. many of you have been in various meetings I can't count anymore how many times we talked about it we had a look at the long-term plan and we couldn't find anything about it there's we may have missed it but just in case okay um uh I go to school every day with my sister and it's always really scary because cars go really fast and there's not a there's not a safe crossing we just get an island in the middle of the road and we get stuck there for ages as big cars go past and I feel like a safer crossing would be a really good way of fixing the problem the speed seems to be the issue um there are islands but cars go really fast the islands are small imagine a person with a couple of kids or a small to courtesy islands I don't think they're supposed to but they also don't do it even if it would be nice if they did the council has installed some 40 kilometers per hour when children are present signs that have been there for almost a couple of years now they have made no difference in the last week we were talking about this again as a community and people reported an accident a couple of weeks ago maybe yeah the position of those just the positioning of them is terrible yeah with the roads you know southampton street nord street and cars come out and there's just no no time for them to slow down enough for the children and the children will just go sometimes and then if they're always going to monitor the cars but also bikes it's too much for kids to yes and to digest and cars they don't know where to stop when they do people get annoyed many people who are uncertain are driving very confusing if you have something that's really simple and all the know the rules it's gonna be a lot more simple come to the end of the time but if I could just get tim because I think you wanted to you know so I totally in company I totally agree there's no question for me about it and I've been you know championing this for some time to total failure but we do have staff coming with a new design of a um island and so I'm not quite sure when that's happening but it certainly needs more than one and I do agree with the signs um I do think in that the between of prior to norwood and southampton that we do need the flashing 40k signs so we should work on that a bit more to that question there has been a commitment from the council to do this yeah quite a few times over the years but yeah it doesn't happen what we've ended up with we're in a large sort of kind of long-term plan process and we've got a number of other people hearing submissions getting them to speak directly to the counsellors have been really helpful so I'd like to not just thank you easter but to thank um the young people for coming as well makes a difference so well done thank you cheers so anna and neil youngman
Next we have nikki aiken thank you for having me back again this is my personal application for foreign swimming pool funny thing is on a thursday morning I'm usually there swimming so I'm here today just to talk about how I personally enjoy the pool and I've been using it since I was a student for over 30 years go swimming pretty much once a week and I love it I love it church corner it's nice and easy to get to has on-site parking it's it's a nice atmosphere that the staff are lovely to talk to I've made some good friends that we see each time we go swimming at the same time each week you know it has everything you need to to swim there I know it's not the grandest and flashest pool it doesn't have a spa room or a sauna or a pool or anything like that but but that's actually what I love about it because it is quieter it's not to say it's not busy but because there's into the pool you can do your thing you don't have to walk a long way from the changing rooms to the pool side um yeah I just think it's it's it's a lovely pool it's um yeah you can just carry on and and get in there nice atmosphere and you're out again um and so yeah I'm just really passionate that you do consider it from all different levels so yeah I've done my work one and here's my personal submission just I'm I'm curious around whether there's you know an an alternative I mean the council doesn't run the pool you know does the council need to own the pool that's I mean it's just an open-ended question um I'm sorry I i haven't even considered that um yeah the community of the community if the council was happy to take that on and go with that that could be wonderful yes just to see that it stays in the local community because I know you can't control everything your hand up sorry yeah look I was only going to say I just really appreciated your comments on the cycleways as well so yeah probably it's completely separate to the front paul but I thought that was a really valid point and a theme that has come through so thank you thank you I'm not sure if you'd be able to answer this but the last lady said the ministry of education owns the land do you know if the council's leasing the land from them for the pool or anything about that I don't know a lot about it and I only heard this yesterday and I'm sorry I didn't do any more research but the the pool is on the ministry of education the other way around that ministry of education owns the recreation center land we own the uh pool land is that how it is we're just just double checking on covenants and restrictions right but um it seems to me that there is potential around the pool um in a in a broader context but um're receiving yes and I think this one club I think is leading a major submission on saturdays right right yeah yeah so we can explore all of these that would be wonderful just really appreciate that fact that you've heard what I've had to say yeah thank you very much thank you now um if I know we've got
Much thank you now um if I know we've got ian wells as the next one you're welcome hello um there's a personal submission and um my background is I do cycling advocacy and I run a couple of bike rides and I all my professional background is in i.t and I also continue to support the i.t community as well and first of all this is a long-term plan so I'll try to want to adjust for the longer term things that I see in the city um number one is climate change I was really pleased to see this so much emphasis on climate change and they would um hopefully get more and more of the climate crisis uh issues uh put into our long-term plans and as an example I'm really impressed with just the change over the last couple of years of all the cycleways they're it's really become much more joyful in the city to be able to ride on these uh highways city bicycle highways going around the city and hopefully we'll get more of those big check for our emphasis on climate change my background in it too I'm really interested in information as climate change becomes more pervasive and requires more and more money and resources I think the information how information is put out by the council becomes more important if you can just look at the effect that anti-vaxxers for example have on community health and the health of all of us I would like to encourage more analysis of what it takes to counter information that is not in our common good and common good of our children in terms of long-term plan I'm really sad to see the urban sprawl that's happened since the earthquake and that's uh I continue to encourage more higher density housing and more ways not making decisions on land how not to use land for large housing tracks and use it for things that are most appropriate for example agriculture in many places and and the last point really is on sustainability and what metrics we're using are being used and I'd like to see more encourage it's're that information about sustainability metrics is being conveyed and improved as well for example how much how do we count uh carbon credits for offshore server farms or cars electric cars that are manufactured overseas I think those are all real impacts and more attention to the exact metrics and improving the metrics would be really good so thank you thank you very much and just perfect timing so thank you for your submission
Uh felicity blackmore from christchurch international airport limited good afternoon thank you for your time this afternoon to hear our submission my name is nick flack I'm general manager of planning and sustainability at the airport and this is felicity blackmore uh header planning at airport so thank you for um taking the time to hear us today and um I'll take our submission as read and stick to a few key points um firstly it's recognition of airport authorities as non-raidable land under the local government act and this reflects the role that airports provide in the wider transport network and the services we provide with respect to being a strategic asset generally strategic assets should be treating differently as per our status under the local government rating act um the services we currently provide on our input land holdings we own we install we operate and we maintain our own land drainage and water supply network this includes managing a complex network of resource consents managing under these and managing our compliance with them we manage our own wastewater network within the airport campus and we provide our own waste management services including a waste minimisation aspect we believe that the target rates proposal does not consider or recognize the airport as a non our non-ratable land our role of the airport as a strategic asset or the current provision for the three waters that we provide ourselves or the waste collection that we provide essentially the targeted rate proposal results with the airport paying twice for some of these services which puts an unnecessary burden on the airport we believe that there is a strong and compelling case for setting targeted rates in a differential way for strategic asset providers and or airport authorities in for a bit more detail in the land drainage space the airport owns nine million dollars worth of stormwater assets we spend approximately three hundred and sixty hundred thousand dollars a year to maintain and operate these assets and to comply with our very complex stormwater discharge consent framework we take the burden off the chrysler city council by managing this private infrastructure network ourselves we understand the rationale that is being applied to the land range targeted rate from the wider city council's network however we degree we disagree with the way it's currently drafted as it results with a disproportionate burden on to strategic asset providers and asset providers such as us who have such a large private network we've outlined our relief and our submission however in the event that this is not accepted it's our expectation that the city council would take over ownership operation and management of our current network and would operate this network to meet our resource consent requirements or to amend the city council's global resource consent to incorporate discharges from the airport land holdings in the water supply space the targeted rates proposal identifies that some of the airports land holdings fall within the definition of a serviceable area but similar to land drainage we take the burden off the city council and we operate our own private water supply network so everyone on campus we supply all of their water we've recently spent an excess of five million dollars upgrading our potable water supply network to provide water treatment plants to meet the type of water treatment plant plants that we have installed on the airport campus and we strongly oppose being captured under the current service area definition as we do not currently and will not in the future receive any benefit from the christian city council water supply waste management um in the targeted rates proposal um cio land holdings currently sit entirely within the kerbside collection area and within the targeted rate however similar to the other services cil operations in our terminal and majority of our tenants do not access kerbside waste collection now or plan to in the future and previously we understood that areas of our campus were not actually able to receive kerbside collection with this being dakota park in our warehouse and distribution centre we don't obtain any benefit generally from kerbside collection across the city and as with our land drainage and water supply the council obtains a benefit from our private management of waste we and our tenants bear the cost of this private waste management and minimisation program rather than imposing the costs on the council systems applying the waste minimisation amounts to double charging we see our already contracts separately for waste management services including waste minimization wastewater which is slightly different we provide our own network within our land holdings however we do have two connection points to the city council's network and this is this is a shared service we pay for managing our own network but we understand and acknowledge that the council pays for that network and pays for the treatment of that therefore we see this as a great example is where differential rates should apply to reflect the cost-sharing benefit so I guess in summary uh it's important to recognize the airport authority's status under the local government act um as non-notable in our role as a strategic asset provider the targeted rates proposal does not reflect this and put significant burden on to christchurch airport and paying for these services twice and we believe there's a strong case for differential rating and lastly very quickly we strongly support the provision for a safe and efficient cycle way to the airport um we understand and we've been involved in we are not confident that the wings aspect of the wings to wheel cycle way has been appropriately involved in this process and we are also not convinced that the current design and location will actually service the airport in the way that it needs to feedback from the airport staff and from our wide attendant basis is that the current route would not be used by a lot of people because it doesn't provide for the efficient aspect we strongly believe in feedback from a lot of our tenants was that memorial wave is the appropriate place to provide for a safe and efficient cycle network to reach the airport and this is to reflect that people who are riding a bike to as a method of transport whether it be an e-bike or a normal bike they are looking for the most efficient and safe route and it's important that those two factors are considered the current wings to wheel cycleway proposal doesn't capture uh the south eastern section of the city and means that a lot of cyclists will have to bike a considerably would be a deterrent for a lot of cyclists so we we support and recognize that there is a really strong need for a cycleway out to the airport and feedback from all of our tenants is part of trying to meet the climate commission's advice and trying to reduce carbon emissions is to encourage people to ride bikes instead of hopping in single occupancy cars but to make that successful it's got to be a cycle way that is safe and efficient because it takes longer to ride your bike somewhere and it takes more of your own energy so we we would um if in the event that the wings to wheel cycle way comes up to be re-looked at we would really like to be involved in that process and we're also at the same time doing a large piece of work with our wider tenant base and campus to understand what the needs are in the space so we we welcome engagement on that I'm going to have to cut that off to it because that's a separate consultation but I you very much for the presentation I think we're going to have to also um sort of link in with staff on the broader issue that you've raised which which I we were certainly expecting the airport company to raise so thank you very much for a very um in-depth submission thank you thank you thank you thank you esther valero
And sorry for my glasses um irene leon ethwood I'm not irene only at the weekends um I'm gonna give this presentation nobody heard that did they yes but yes we did hear that exactly that but I'm assuming that you're irene so I'm going to give the presentation on behalf of irene but this comes from her and what's your name my name's tim webster I work a lot with neurological conditions stroke being one of them but parkinson's ms brain injury etc but from an exercise perspective so it comes no great surprise to anybody that as we get older long-term health conditions are becoming more and more common now I'm only 59 I knew I should never have done this I'm glad you said that because I'm older than that so look like this comes as no surprise and and it's it's summarized in the first slide that we have there what's quite interesting is that this is from the ministry of health in february of this year so it's it's the common view of disability is this but disability I want to get rid of that term we are we are working with people with long-term health conditions so parkinson's people aren't parkinson's patients anymore they're people with parkinson's yeah and that whole language and semantics thing needs to be taken into account so the people that we're talking about this is techa he's part of our prostate prostate cancer group this is wayne he has parkinson's but he still juggles and this is phillip who's sitting behind me he's just down the 10k uh phillips had five strokes I think and holds the record so these are the people that we're now talking about so what's the size of the problem well according to all of the research one in four new zealanders is now living with a long-term health condition one in four big number so now you can read that and I'm expecting a smile um so thus far the strategy has been to thus far the strategy has been to enable disabled people facilities and I think that's worked I think there's been a pretty good job done of that but this cohort now is so big that our submission our in submission is that we now need it's no longer adequate and we now need to look at creating something else so people with long-term health conditions need condition specific exercise it is no use putting them into a mainstream exercise facility they need people who are qualified to work with their particular conditions and it's very relevant for stroke council gyms are great I work with the council all the time council gyms are fantastic but they're not equipped to do this job and they're not staffed to do this job so with the exception of people like irene who is gutsy and determined and rocked up at my door having caught three buses she catches three buses to come to me at a gym from new brighton um there are somewhere north of a hundred thousand people in christchurch living with long-term health conditions who are in the dark they are on their own go to mainstream uh exercise facilities so and if you're living with a stroke and you're in the dark you are in trouble you're on a very slippery slope to mental health issues and that's a whole other ballgame so this is a big a big deal and our request this afternoon or irene's request is that uh the council uses some of its 13 billion budget to explore creating a world-class exercise facility and I mean world-class uh in christchurch to meet the hundred needs of the hundred thousand people one in four who are living with long-term health conditions now you can talk want to say anything I i also propose not to a new brighton have a community center we don't have one and then for the tumor also for children so can I just have one thing before you ask any questions we tend to associate people's conditions with who they are irene is a vice president of an american bank she's lived in hong kong she's lived all over the world that's who she is't know if there's any questions sorry you um raised you know a really significant issue because as you say in the submission because I read the submission beforehand and it commented on the you know the availability of some support within the health system for example if you've had an accident but not if you've got a health condition and you know and that's to me I just wonder whether we should be a city that perhaps connects the all of the resources of the city and if we could perhaps talk to the to the health board about whether we could we could treat our facilities as more available um beyond the cause of the of the particular condition because I think of the fabulous facility out of burwood and um you know places like that whether we could do that a little bit more constructively sorry yeah the bellwood I've been there is not open for public no that's what I'm saying is that if we could find a way of not caring about why you're in a condition we took away the why then that would create more facilities but we've also got our metro sports facility which is due to open in the near future and and I'm thinking that I mean I want it to be a well-being center I don't I don't want it to be focused on on anything other than offering opportunities for people um so let's see if we can take that conversation further um tim thank you and um irene and weekend irene thank you very much for your presentation um I just actually that's what I was thinking about my understanding was that the metro sports was going to have a facility of this type could we get an update of that because I think it's really important thank you great thank you the um public health health of kirito and all that they are the germany is so close to each other you can really access to work to chair your mobility care which is why the metro sports may in fact be the better option for uh people who who use you've you've raised a really powerful point your submission was really good making the personal trip in here to present to us really helps so thank you very much for doing that yep thank you all right now
Thank you thank you uh ron andrew president of the christchurch beautifying association good afternoon afternoon thank you for being here and thank you for what you do and councillors thank you for the opportunity to speak to you on our paper first of all on the cut and funding just a comment for that we're absolutely dedicated and continuing with community pride and with street and garden awards and there's a lot of options that we're looking through to try and accommodate this cut in funding but it's quite drastic over the 10 years and we're already in trouble actually spending our own money club members along with a lot of time we've got some major changes coming in the um warts and we'll have to do a fever to work to get that sorted so that we can run it next year thank you for your support too for the um christchurch beautifully the second one is the proposed excess water use targeted rate I apologize for so much in there 40 years in the government services but I have to to me is that uh we cannot find reference to any budget measures that refer to repairing what it appears to be a major cost and risk and that is the loss of around 20 of the water that's been allocated to us by the regional council the second thing is uh who pays for that interrupted delivery and if I was to be presumptuous I would say that the right players would and if that's correct it seems that over the 10-year period rate payers will pay approximately the equivalent of three times the annual water rates in that 10 years for no extra water no extra water third it appears that the pumping capacity in some cases is not fit for purpose um there's uh some of it have been some of the pumping equipment's been withdrawn uh and we can find nothing that says that it'll be replaced and yet recently we had an ordinary day and a few days and we were put on restrictions because we were unable to keep the storage tanks full for firefighting and I would the two things that would feature in this that we have to have the water for emergencies and we have to have a normal day supply a normal day supply and I can find no rational argument for 700 liters a day I can't see a calculation based on all of the variables and everything that says that is when we go on to using excess water in fact using excess water the interpretation of excess water currently is about the amount of water we're allocated by the uh regional council and uh that that is less sorry more than what's available that's the only interpretation of excess and we have much difficulty in working out why a specific section of the city's ratepayers are targeted for something that hasn't been identified as requiring this extra penalty gone sorry it's okay I mean but um was there anything else that you wanted to specifically touch on because I think you've covered the main points of the two elements of your submission thank you yeah okay thank you very much
Uh good afternoon everyone thank you for letting me um talk to you about the um land drainage targeted rate tool properties that the council was proposing um if you read my submission you can see the costs um like I'd sort of struggle to work out how the council can spend um 48 million dollars and have no way of knowing how to pay for it apart from working onto the right part and um just reading your letter that we received on the 30th of march I think it was um saying that the proposal to the land drainage targeted rate will not change the overall amount recovered so to me that just means that you're just passing the back on to the rural peninsula um landowners and household players um and basically the way I see it it's you're just passing the back on something that the council will um do and we we as rural land owners on the benchmark so we get no benefit whatsoever unless we come to town and um if we do use anything in town I guess want to buy in the city so the cost and the cost to us personally as a farmer you can see is just under 30 and a half thousand dollars we paying rates now and it's going to be another fourteen hundred dollars after three years um and and basically like I say no benefit to us and we we're have to do our own um water management at home we've got over a thousand hectares we've got to look after and also with the roads um we live on island bay road which is two and half k's no exit road and the last three times we've had that graded I've had to go up and with the tractor on my own account and level the road out so I can actually get a car a two-wheel drive car can come up and down the road um so to me that's just just cost cutting and then now you want to take more money office and then also you're putting in this coastal protection you want to put in this more I'm actually going to have to get consent to spray my weeds on the coastal protection so looking from where we look um I just believe that you you've suddenly seen the farmers as a cash cow for the christchurch city council and um we're totally against what you're saying thank you for your time thank you very much um you are not alone we've had a number of submissions on this and a very powerful presentation from federated farmers in a group earlier on this afternoon so did you have a question so do you it sounds like you're saying the fundamental misunderstanding really from the council's point of view about what farmers do in terms already in terms of drainage and land yeah it's all the cost of what we I mean we get no because I'm if this comes through I presume we can ring the council if we get a slip over a farm track can we um you know we're right paws and that's that's a hazard to us um so I can of worms that probably you don't need to get involved with yeah okay and you did say that sort of come out of the blue what could have been done better in terms of engaging with you for example before this came out of the blue uh just a bit more time because you know we're in the middle of probably one of the worst droughts in history on bank sponsor and um yeah the whole time and plus with the um coastal protection coming out of some of the timing um just sort of seeing everything's rush we'll try and sneak it through without anyone taking any notice and maybe have a bit more you know public because he had a public meeting with the coastal protection but nothing about this one it's really helpful to have your submission and um you know the the purpose of this is to engage with people so um perhaps a bit of additional thought going into the front end might have um precluded some of the things that we're going through now but thank you a submission and fronting up much appreciated thank you
Great thank you very much um uh kate hodgens thank you for the opportunity for um to address you today on a friday afternoon um I would like to submit that the council consider accelerating the proposed funding for cycleways in martinsville power area I've lived in the area since 2004. three children and I am the chair of the st martin school board today most cycleway funding has focused on the long arterial routes connecting far-flung suburbs in the city however according to local kotahi nzta the sixth of household car trips in new zealand are under two kilometers long and almost half are less than six kilometers long it's these the shorter trips which are the most polluting and cost car car owners most in terms of wear and tear it's also a lot more realistic to encourage people to bike commute five kilometers than to bike commute 15 kilometers the census figures reflect this saint martin's which sits at about five kilometers in the city centre boasts more than double the percentage of cycle commuters than the city average yet over 66 percent than the city average it's these commuters who should be the low hanging fruit to encourage to alternative modes yet instant martins our bus services have been consistently downgraded over the past 10 years and there are no plans for cycleways until 2029 as well as being so close to the city centre many of our children travel to kashmir high and with recent rezoning many will also go to lynnwood saint martins is also a main access to some of the city's most popular recreational tracks according to the ranger the montgomery spur track of is the most well-used biking track in the port hills despite all of this there are a few cycleways connecting the suburb and those cycleways that do exist often have glaring gaps at dangerous intersections or disappear with roadway narrows safety or the perception of risk is a huge barrier to getting on a bike the study I mentioned in my submission that found that 39 percent of respondents would bike if there was better infrastructure a recent study of transport mla found that women only accounted for 16 of those biking hundred and twenty percent increase in women cycling on those streets we certainly noticed the huge upsurge in cycling on our quiet streets in the suburb during the lockdown finally like other submitters I would like to ask the council to seriously consider creating a single agency to manage public transportation for christchurch the current system with one agency managing buses and other managing everything else never mind local kotahi is inefficient leads to siloed thinking and lacks accountability a truly 21st century integrated public transport system is not just a bus service it includes everything from safe cycleways to trains trams gondolas autonomous buses ferries and everything in between it needs to be responsive to the needs of our city as it grows and to be able to accommodate change it should sit at the heart of any change to our city and an integrated multi-modal public transport system for our city requires an integrated multimodal approach from a single agency with clear objectives thank you thank you could you um email that through to the secretary so I can just send it to the minister of transport because for quite some time not just him but his predecessor sorry tim I will know that full all right okay yeah tim thank you I asked this earlier on to another presenter if we were to get bang for our buck with cycleways um would you agree or be happy if we so took the the um gold standard out from some of the ones we've got planned and put in like the paint and the wands etc to get more cycle lanes done but to a lesser standard so we can cover more of christchurch and then revisit as we then get more cyclists moving to the highest standard in time I would definitely um however I would also expect that those cycleways do cover the gaps because at the moment we have these great cycleways with large gaps and that's what we're hearing from a lot of our residents that we've got these wonderful things but the kids can't_``_269.52 go in between because it's dangerous yes great thank you very much sorry and I have got that in writing because it is it was the supplementary submission to the one bottle it's kind of fun this has been kind of summarized in here so I can send it on to you send it send it through because um it was just perfect word perfect thank you thank you ron and
Um thank you for making making your time available um I presume you've read my submission about outdoor lighting which is my main concern I've been involved in stargazing for quite some time first of all as the educator at the auckland observatory and then astronomer at the hermitage and now on volunteering in my retirement as um stargate volunteer stargazer at mount pleasant matariki and redzone stargazing and so forth and helping keep travis whitland suitably weeded and planted but my main concern is of course that we waste an awful lot of money putting light into the sky especially from badly designed street lights uh we also waste a lot of money sending some of that light into people's eyes my own included is glare when I go out to look at the night sky there's a giant bright street light down the street I've twice asked council officers to do something about it but nothing's happened and so I'd urge you to bring in policies that one reduce the light levels especially in suburban areas two make sure that the has huge effects on the diurnal rhythms of insects birds and so on um not to mention ourselves uh we all I hope you all have the blue light killing thing on your smartphones the odd nod okay um and so if we're doing it for ourselves the least we can do is do it for the rest of the living things around us um and I think particularly from a council budget point of view it seems crazy to have huge amounts of street lights burning at night when there's no one around and again I talked to the street light team oh we might be looking at implementing those control thingies on top of the lights once we've got it all installed and I sort of think that's a bit late um please try it out in my street next week and I'll help you get it set up if need be that's probably all I have to say if you've got any questions thank you questions uh pauline look I remember when we were approving the led conversions and that would be dimmable yes they are indeed dimmable but it's not actioned yet right so I think we could look into that yeah thanks ah thank you um yeah I kind of in reading your submission kind of talk about having a clear lighting strategy for the city that hopefully informs us have you have you seen any other cities around new zealand that are doing it um I guess in a different way that might be more yeah selwyn's doing a lot more full cut off for example selwyn went to um the big dark sky lighting engineers thing that the dark sky folks in the mckinsey basin put on but no one went from christchurch so I think that your council officers would be well advised to get better educated on how to implement these things I mean there's a new variety of street lighting out I won't go into the technical details yeah I mean like we've raced it um I know nzta require a certain amount and we're told that they require and we can't change it it can of the thing is 300 or something and it's 4 000. it can be the the yeah the memo thing the 4 000 degree thing is ridiculous um it's a blue light essentially and supposedly mimics daylight but in fact you can have a lot yellower light we managed for instance to survive perfectly well on the low change which is sodium which did produce a few strange colors but still work quite effectively so the modern led street lights don't look so horribly yellow but they are nowhere near four thousand they are a wee bit more expensive but then if you dim them right down they're probably no more expensive in the long run yeah thanks I have a lot of sympathy finished so thank you thank you very much thank you much appreciated thank you next is um
Now I'm struggling again with another pronunciation I do and apologize um almost almost I'll I will pronounce my my name so that you that's all right just before I start um can I just say thank you to all the staff who prepared all the documentation put this all together it's a ton of work it's greatly appreciated you guys are doing a great source of democracy so thank you very much um anyway so to get started um in general I think like these previous speakers I've said uh there's quite a lot of good stuff in the long term plan so thank you for that putting a climate change lens across all of the activities that you do is useful and obviously the council has apparently declared a climate emergency and therefore doing that makes sense um things like prioritizing the major cycle routes um I think is a good idea but I think in addition to that we do need more coherence on on that on the transport strategies and I want to kind of touch on the the've spoken since about 2015 about getting things together and some coherent body across it still as far as the public can see hasn't happened which I think is a massive gap and obviously there's some uh disparate priorities between the two organizations and and you know we've had six years now climate change is coming and we don't have a good public transport strategy because of these things people need to get over it and get it sorted out I think um so in addition to that uh and as a rate player um I i do support the proposals around the rates um I think um rates should be entirely progressive and probably but a bit more aggressive in some some cases um we shouldn't have things like flat rates which I know you can't have proposed in the past um and obviously the higher the capital value that you know I think it should be even a larger proportion of rates that are paid and I think the number of properties that an entity owns should also have some bearing on are you know 200k each and someone has 1 400k property you should be paying roughly the same amount right but it doesn't end up being that way depending how you sell the progressiveness so those kinds of inequity should be addressed and I think one of the big things about all of these things is that to me the ltp strikes is not really addressing uh in structural inequalities so things like you know the mobile services around our libraries uh the closure of uh richard and uh the proposed closure of the recurrent business interchange strikes me as as hitting people where who are already vulnerable to things that we can't do and I think uh you know another loop needs to be taken with an equity lens across this and in terms of the overall strategy and the long term stuff I think there's still a deep misunderstanding about the impacts of climate change voters mitigation adaptation right and it's not necessarily specifically in the ltp but things like the terrorist airport expansion or the new airport is an idea that that to degree of what the climate emerges says it's one thing to declare the emergency but if you don't understand the implications of it and and have have long-term plans that don't actually work out it's not very useful so mostly a good job but there are some things that you guys need to take a look at and please take a really actual long-term view of the long-term plan and not just you know the next one and a half years till the election thanks oh sorry yanny we had a question for you so I just just just really quick around the bus lounge in rickard yeah the city used to have a strategy have bus lounges and other suburbs as well do you think we should look at a suburban bus interchange hub lounge type strategy across the city I think so um obviously it depends on the usage and I think one of the things to promote usage is better accessibility and I think allowing us to address that obviously you also have to look at the impact on the community and what'm supportive of social strategy great thank you very much thanks um kate hodgens
Right dorothy please welcome okay it's um it's dot actually not dorothy sorry um I am hoping you've read my other submission but my written one but I'd also like to apologize for the various typographical errors in it but I just wanted to emphasise the part about the water rates because I don't support the introduction of the water rates as they proposed in the long term plan I know many people do support this rate saying we'll teach people the value of water and stop them wasting it but I'm a person whose water use could come into the excess water category and I understand exactly the value of the water I use I live in heihei and have a big garden it's built hey is built on the old waimakariri riverbed and the soil is patchy with boulders and sand interspersed with the loam I have since I bought the property planted many native trees shrubs and tussock grasses as well as fruit trees and an extensive veggie garden this garden supported me and my son when I lived pensioner I give surplus food to friends relatives the local salvation army food bank and the community pantry it supports my physical and my mental health and last year I won an award in the edible and sustainable garden competition despite years of building up the soil with manure and mulch my garden's free draining soil still needs a lot of water to keep plants healthy and growing I've mulched just about everything I cut and trim in the garden and my lawn is left to dry out and when I can I plant more areas in tussock as their longer roots catch more carbon and survive the hot dry periods better than lawn grasses over the last three years with this dry dry dry weather I have realised that unwatered areas of my garden are becoming excessively dry and dusty insect life and the soil's bio organisms are dying out I provide water daily for birds bees and other insects water captured in my kitchen my bathroom and my laundry uh supplement water from my hose I'm already worried that my little healthy biodiverse ecosystem that water charges could force me to cut back on the essential watering I do there are hundreds of gardeners like me throughout the city we provide carbon sinks of trees and the biodiversity which should be valued we should be an essential part of the christchurch's climate change plan and instead of putting on excessive water charges we should be I think given rate rebates for the number of trees we've got on our properties after all they are helping to contribute to the carbon sink of the city um there are other things the city council could do to limit water use they could support landowners and end them fix pipes on their own land as well more quickly they could encourage people just to away from the green english lawn and into the um into a more new zealand sort of grassland thing they they could talk personally to those wall whose water race is really excessive and give support and guidance to help them reduce water and to think of better ways of gardening I support water education in schools and all public classes more about climate change the future droughts and act immediately to increase the green profile of the city everywhere there is a space for a tree it needs to have one put in thank you thank you we're just coming to the end of the time so thank you very much for your submission it's much appreciated thank you thank you
Thank you thank you madam neil roberts thank you for the opportunity to um hear the submission uh this very small slight submission on the uh on the plans by the by the city council to uh proposal to curtail by 25 the education activities of the christchurch art gallery I'm speaking as a former art teacher secondary school art teacher and a former art gallery professional and I know the full well the implications of cutting back on services like this the art gallery is about education that's what it is it has an education specific education aspect everything within the art gallery is in a way involved with education so cutting back on the dedicated education services means you're going to impact on all the engagements that they do throughout the community and throughout schools schools of course very important they're the future visitors to the christchurch art gallery they're our future and I think cutting that is very short-sighted in a way we'll take services back 20 years it'll go back to the days of the mcdougall because you're education in the gallery and expanding it not cutting it so that's just my slight uh opinion anyway a valuable opinion thank you for expressing it has anyone got any questions thank you very much
Uh leon woody kia ora good afternoon good afternoon I am opposing some of the forecasted rates or the rate vision of increasing rates or how they're increased for example myself I own a property at teddington I've farmed there for 99 years and a few months time um and still there and still work on it I also own a house that I bought 12 years ago in the city's fairly central and because I have business interests in the city uh this enabled me to stay at that house at times so I'm compared the two rates that I pay at teddington and the rate I pay in christchurch central and I find that I'm paying close on double the rate at teddington because the capital value is at a is higher than a house in town because it's got farm land now the proposed new rate is designed to take money off capital value the increase of capital value um this will increase my rates again we have the normal increase of seven percent or what it is and this is of the sky like that um oh how can we get more rates so uh well we'll get it off the people that we think are wealthy wealthy really doesn't come into it because there are assets that are producing money or business for the continuation of new zealand for instance my farm produces and it has done for most of those years and lamb and at times it has produced horticulture so the ever increasing cost goes on to the production of what we need is money to run things and this gets serious when they I've seen the chart of how much uh this would increase my rate at teddington uh yes okay it's a 180 or 90 or something in the first year then it works up to 690 I think in three years time but then of course will be another seven percent on those three years too now is this fair you say the the council says they feel it's fair well I don't feel it's fair and there's a lot of people that will be affected now this council doesn't produce anything for us it doesn't give us water it doesn't give us sewage we haven't_''_265.68 a bust do I don't want a bus but to get things straight it is pretty lopsided now often on your my town rate demand is a list of things they subscribe to and a lot of those things I never use or will use so they're asking me to play post bring in more rates to so as they can carry on with their central city beautification and going on yes rights will have to increase over a certain extent but I feel uh it's a lot of it is not directed to the needs at present mr woody have you come in to make submissions before sorry okay have you come in to make submissions before have you come to make a submission before you know I mean I to improve the the council outlook on building in the area and they stipulated a height which was quite super silly it meant that a person couldn't build a proper for a service to get a building consent or yeah yeah so what I'm saying is is that um you're not alone there's a number of people in your situation who have come to make submissions on exactly the point you have raised and what I wanted to say is is that it's taken this particular issue to bring you to the table and I wanted to thank you for making a submission because it's extremely helpful for us you'll appreciate none of us are experts on everything that is put in front of us but the value of you coming and making a submission is that we have heard what you have said and that will be taken into account when we finalize our long-term plan so I wanted to thank you for coming in thank you thank you uh
Thank you uh we've got peter tuffley who's the vice chair of the beckham neighborhood association good afternoon I have to press a button anywhere no it's all done for you lovely um good afternoon madam mayor and councillors and um madam chief executive and staff and thank you for this opportunity to address you um and I'd like to congratulate the council on producing one of the probably the most fit for purpose consultation documents that I've seen emerge from the council in over 20 years overall there's much in the ltp that we strongly support we broadly support the proposed financial strategy and the strategic priority according to accorded to water and transport we very much applaud the emphasis on climate change and with a number of items on our last year's wish list actually coming to fruition it's good to feel that we have a council that has actually listened to us however there remains some matters of concern on which we would like the council to listen to us more attentively among these are the following firstly the heralded review of local government underlines the importance of cooperation between both councils we've said this to ecan already because we know it's a two-way street especially but not only in respect of water and transport we need the two arms of our local government to work together as complementary parts of a whole with this review in prospect we also need to see both councils standing together in defense of democratic local government and against any diminution of its powers the second area of concern we I'd like to bring to you is library services we regard any proposed cartel into library services as highly regrettable in particular we see the proposal to end the mobile library service as an especially mean blow to vulnerable people particularly elderly people for many of whom it may well mean denial of library access altogether because of their lack of mobility in the context of a multi-billion dollar budget this strikes us as an uncharacteristic instance of penny-pinching meanness the next thing I'd like to talk about is the proposed closure of service desks at acura and littleton concerned about this but there are two reasons for it the first is the stated assumption that the only important purpose of service desks is the conduct of financial transactions this assumption was used as the rationale for the council's 2006 attempt to close all service desks throughout the city and as we pointed out back then it is not true the staff on these desks serve as the local human face of the council giving residents help information and advice on a wide range of matters and I've personally experienced that over between more than 20 years as a bna rep with our local service center staff where could there be more need for the council to show a human face than acura its most remote outpost in view of that stated false rationale our second reason for concern is that this proposal looks like a first step towards closing service desks throughout the city at some later stage we warned the council against this the last time the council tried this on it aroused such city-wide resistance that the council actually revisited and rescinded its decision facebook so so if there is a next time that the council had better watch out because you guys won't know what's hit you uh in the meantime please do not go ahead with this the president proposed to jackaro or littleton we don't want to see this happen anywhere in the city lastly the implementation of the mid-heathcote linear park master plan this project was ready to go before the 2010 earthquake since then our community has been forced to endure more than 10 years of deferred hope and now this ltp tells us that we are expected to wait for at least 10 years more with a mockery of derisary dribs and drabs spent here and there on this all that over the next few years this is unconscionable madame madame and enough is more than enough thank you thank you that was it was absolutely spot on for your five minutes so thank you very much peter and really appreciate the comments that you've made and and and to wind up on that one unconscionable I haven't heard that one today so much thank you thank you madam map neil roberts
The next person is sarah anderson tena koto katoa sarah anderson aho I'm here to talk about the um more of an arts focused although I will actually signal that I am a selwyn district council resident live in lincoln use the bus service all the time and I bus and cycle and I concur with everything that my previous people have said about the bus services they need upgrading not downgrading uh anyway I am here to talk about the gallery and the library and the art centre I'm a frequent visitor to all of those places I also work in the city I'm the arts coordinator at papua new high school so I have first-hand knowledge of the valuable role of the art gallery is providing in giving art experiences to the youth of the city with its education program whether it's exhibitions with its outreach programs with its nighttime programs and I am very aware that you know there is a small pool of money and a large number of things that need our focus and attention and I was thinking um today that the arts and culture are the icing on the cake and you can have the cake without the icing and still function but to me the analogy is more that you need your cake and your cake is all your infrastructure like water and storage and roads and all of that but the thing that actually makes the cake rise is the arts and culture without it you've got a very flat cake so really I don't think I need to say a lot more except that there is a lot of passion in the city and there's a lot of talent in this city and it needs places to express itself and those places are really important and they are what make this city special as opposed to just being a place where people live so any questions uh aaron mine's a quick one and thank you for your submission but with your last name being anderson are you related to lin because you look and sound like lin the manager from arana park no you know but anderson is up there with smith'll just take a look we'll be in kyoto sarah the uh educational um program over at the arts art gallery you're suggesting that we should retain that how many people would that affect um how many people go there about ten thousand a year cycle through there that is school students specifically into the education program it's about ten thousand at papanui high school I mean obviously that's not the numbers an individual school will be sending but we bring kids in we've I've done two school trips in the last month into the gallery with senior students looking one at the hautery exhibition another one at design and and functionality around the city um and we've got students coming in for the cr for creating this workshop uh next week actually so it's constant and they do a fantastic job with the primary school students okay thanks thank you very much for your thank you time and trouble and making a submission to us thank you um diana shand
Uh littleton historical museum society peter uh good afternoon my name is peter ruff I'm a vice president of the littleton historical museum society and chair of its development subcommittee based on my experience with the museum society and our quest to build a new museum I'd like to convey with some images the society's support for the disposal of council owned land especially for suitable new uses and our support for the continued funding of the akaroa and littleton's design review panels the littleton museum and society were established just over 50 years ago uh in in the latter years the museum was housed in a building on norwich key which is a council-owned building it was severely damaged in the 2011 earthquakes and subsequently demolished but luckily the 95 of the collection was recovered by the littleton volunteer fire brigade and was taken to a recovery center at the air force museum of new zealand at wigram after the earthquakes the museum society decided they wanted the museum to continue and we prepared a strategic plan with three principal projects the first project concerned worked over any damage was made good it was catalogued it was photographed and it was wrapped and are made safe and and the collection is still in storage at the wig room or waiting being housed in a new museum the second project was to maintain and develop community engagement we built a website and that's the contents pages shown there we've established a facebook page and an instagram site and the whole of the museum's collection is now available to be viewed online that includes over ten thousand photographs over the years um society has organized small pop-up exhibitions and online exhibitions on various topics and in a sense we've kept the museum alive even though we haven't um had a a museum a building to house that our collection in the third project was to build a new museum but we needed a site and we set criteria for a site and identified over a dozen uh building sites ten of which are shown on the aerial photograph we focused on numbers three four five and three four five and six which have a high profile site a much higher profile site than the previous building in norwich key indian numbers four five and six ended up being unsuitable or unavailable and number three was a site of the former service center of this of the council but it too was damaged and demolished after the earthquakes we were informed it was likely to be surplus to council requirements and that the council may consider gifting the land to the museum society we applied and we're very grateful to have been gifted the site at 33 london street for the purpose of building a new museum that was in 2017. the site is on the southern side of london street adjacent to the library it's just past the libraries on the right it's just past that tree uh that's another sort of front on view the the with the library on the right hand side this is a view today looking down into the site we've established a small cabin which we use as an office and for displaying uh small exhibitions we've set up established the cannon there and prior to the land being gifted um the london street site being gifted this the site the society appointed warren omani as our architects and we established a brief with them on our sort of spatial requirements and once the gifting of the site had been finalized they prepared a concept design report for us so I'll just jump straight to an image of the proposed museum as viewed from across london street there'll be an entrance in retail on the ground floor two levels above that would be for exhibitions and there'll be a basement for storage and working on the collection and the proposal at that stage was to clad the building and weathered corten steel in november 2018 our architects and our planner and ourselves presented the concept design to a littleton design review panel they were very fable in their response to the to the design they commended the establish a relationship we've established with amana fedor that's an artificial rapacki they like the spatial arrangement of the building and they commended us on the development of community of littleton however there were some um basic recommendations that they made and one was that we commissioned a cultural narrative in order to achieve an excellent bicultural design outcome that we improved the somewhat flat and blank appearance of three of the facades and that we mitigate the effect of a height breach at the rear of the building so nadi feki um subsequently provided us with a cultural narrative and appointed nathan pohihou um to the society committee as a representative of nadifeki nathan is an artist and assistant curator at the city council art gallery and he worked with our architects to improve the appearance of the building so the cladding got changed from the large oblong panels of core 10 to 600 by 600 millimeter diagonal panels to create a more fine textured surface and more color variation the cladding has a cloak-like feel to it and the edge of the cladding will have patterns inspired by maori cloaks and there will be a carve neutral or entrance feature on the on the london street main entrance the society was actually very pleased with the the littleton design review panel we are considerably more uh pleased with how the proposed museum will look I'd just like to finish with two um summary statements one is that the museum society has benefited from the land that was surplus the council's requirements being gifted to the society for the purpose of building a new museum it's really given us a kickstart to for the museum project and the site is a high profile one in littleton that is ideal for a museum and based on our experience the society supports the disposal of surplus properties from the council's portfolio especially for new uses and finally just to comment on the design review panel we consider that the consultation with the littleton design review panel was very worthwhile in terms of the panel giving us some guidance that has led to a much improved design for the proposed museum which we believe will be a valuable asset to littleton and its community and we use that the council continues to fund design review panels which we understand involve relatively modest sums for acura and the overall integrity of these settlements is maintained and are enhanced thank you thank you very much and thank you for such a detailed submission and for your support for the design panels you know it's um it's very helpful to see a practical example of what contribution they can make so thank you very much thank you thank you we
Good afternoon thank you for the opportunity to make this submission firstly I make clear that the submission is entirely my opinion I'm making this submission because I'm very concerned about the size of the proposed rates increases under the long term plan and the comments by council is that they've done everything they can to keep rates and rates increases to a minimum when that's patently untrue I submit that there are a considerable number of areas in which future budgets can be reduced without compromising core council services such as water reticulation sewage street repairs street lighting etc I submit that there are some areas of expenditure that can be reduced and in some cases eliminated altogether councillors salaries the number and cost of council staff support for community activities such as fireworks displays and festivals non-essential capital projects such as cycleways art purchases purchases of further lands and buildings unless there is a clear majority ratepayer support I also believe that there should be a requirement that council provided facilities such as stadiums and conference facilities run at least at a break-even point they should be able to cover that if competently run I submit that at least some of the capital works in the plan should be reviewed for example the spending of 80 million dollars on the akara wastewater project which works out at over one hundred thousand dollars per rate pair in that area when a scaled down and therefore more cost-effective and affordable scheme would be more appropriate when reading the proposed rates increases in the long-term plan I wonder how connected its authors are to the real world or rate players struggling to make ends meet in this covered world I often wonder if councillors and staff ever stop to think that the rate payer well is not bottomless and that real people have to fund the rates I appreciate that you'll have received many submissions on the long-term plan and that according to a recent quote and the priests from a councillor you ignore most submissions however in the case of my submission I ask that you give some serious consideration to the points that I've made I'll be very happy to assist you supposed to be the leaders of the council and I ask that you show some leadership and actively work to reduce the rates burden by resisting the bureaucrats and making some real decisions I suggest that this is one of the things you were elected to do and if you're not willing to do it then you should resign forthwith and allow someone to be elected who is finally I would like to say that if at the end of the process you persist with the rates increase proposed you cannot say that you've done everything you can to keep rates increases to a minimum as that would be an outright lie thank you for your time thanks very much look um and I know that you've commented on a on a quote that was in the media um and I do want to kind of defend the individual counselor who said that it was misinterpreted um there is no one that sits around this table that doesn't read the submissions doesn't take them into account there will be value judgments applied and people will everyone else's and I really appreciate the fact that you took the time to come here and make a submission sorry but if I could just say though that's not quite fair I was at a recent public meeting or a councillor said that councillors don't make decisions he said in front of at least 20 people publicly stated that councillors do not make decisions the decisions are made by the bureaucrats he said that in front of 20 people I'm sorry I was at a meeting you went I was there and when the councillor particularly said this that's what the person said sorry I thought you were I thought you were commenting on a flippant that a counsellor made at a council meeting no I wasn't referring to anything but it's not that the intention is not to um diminish what you say I'm I'm actually saying thank you for coming and making your time your precious time available to make your views known that's what the purpose of these hearings are and people are listening thank you
I think uh phil former good afternoon all phil foreman here um I'm a resident of gibby's valley just out by much carrara there and I'm speaking against the targeted of the land drainage targeted rate which it says in the documentation is to balance out things because we rural people use christchurch city roads as well we also use nelson roads and rolison roads and a few other places as well so perhaps we should have to pay rates in all those places as well um one of the main reasons I'm against it is as a property holder I do a lot of manual work keeping the water flowing out to the drains in our area as to all my neighbours I have hundreds of meters of swales and open drains which take the water off the hillside the roads and get it out to lake ellismere and that's at some significant cost for me for which I seek no recompense unless the targeted drainage rate goes through and in which case I'll expect to be paid for my time then um far as the value of our properties go we do not have town water sewerage or rubbish collection we don't expect our city cousins to have their rates raised to pay for the services to our community that we don't have which they enjoy and thus we don't see why we should pay more for the drainage of the christchurch city streets um yeah so if we pay for the christchurch city streets drainage we should also be paying for the nelson and wellington and everywhere else we use I think the way things are go right now is quite fair and equitable there's swings and roundabouts and I'm happy not to see a specific land drainage rate any questions well I think that a number of people have raised this issue and and one of the things that you said that really has rung home for me is that whole sense of there are other things that people in the rural community do for their area not just their own properties but for their area that that just don't end up on a I think it's a very powerful point thank you is there any other are there any questions thank you very much thank you very much create
Good afternoon as stated we pay rates on seven titles two of them have a house on them four of them are landlocked so these seven titles there's no council infrastructure or servicing so no water waste water sewage drainage rubbish or recycling bins yet we pay over nineteen and a half thousand dollars in rates to the council so we have to cover our own servicing and consenting for a septic tank water is totally our responsibility we can easily spend six hours a week checking and maintaining it on a dry year like this we've spent over five thousand dollars already just to keep it up and maintained for animal welfare we have a seven day night weekend responsibility and we can't just ring a council and have to pay every cent for this farmers might have a high capital value but they aren't released as many are just passed through generations of families they're not like a house where you can buy and sell quickly and release the value times have changed along with our environment the council needs to change and income so it needs to be needs resources and money on necessities gone over days of spending money on image and appeasing a few and buying votes target rates and users pays have to be applied especially in christchurch just like in our farming business and don't come asking me for more rates when you can spend waste 2.4 million on a red house in acura assets like tioca farm are a waste of time but costa council hundreds of thousands of dollars a year you're lucky to see two cars a week using any other walkways while it gets sold to us it's giving us public access to two beaches this is a load of rubbish as the best access is through the neighbours and always has been available now we see hundreds of man hours using weed eaters for the walkways because it is no longer grazed by stock and thousands of dollars will have to be spent on wild and pines for the same reason the council continually buy and retire land thus losing rates income and creating more costs opening to lake elizabeth land leased to farmers now the land by lake alasmir is a total fire danger to us into burling flat township and the land by lake ellismere is long grass and smelly cesspit which birds don't even live in these are just three examples on my boundary there's some of the water out of one of your little waterways which is landlocked and no stock have been there for 10 years but there's thousands of geese and swans living in that water the council is trying to take and restrict our private owned land by lake elizabeth costing us thousands of dollars as you try and implement new zones on us but still for us still charging us full rates on this land now we're expected to fork out and fund millions of dollars to fix the infrastructure in christchurch for christchurch people when most of them think banks peninsula is a big playground but it's actually our land and our business and our home which we strive to look after and improve thanks very much um that's perfectly timed um so thank you thanks oh not really somebody might want it from your gin tonight or something well if you weren't listening you wouldn't know you wouldn't want to drink
Welcome I've got a few slides to show you I'm going to try and talk quickly so we can ask questions afterwards I live in maroha and for those of you who don't know maroha it's a small pocket within the inner sword it's quite a sort of mixed area we've got areas that are well off we've got areas of real deprivation I'll put the deprivation index up for you we've had quite a few earthquake impacts in our community which are still ongoing we lost our community centre which has had huge impact we've lost lots of schools we've lost community capacity a community group that used to run our community centre has just disappeared and unfortunately some of the people have actually died um we've got deprivation issues we've got damaged road and we've still got damaged infrastructure which I know is an issue across many areas of the city and so of course it's got a few photos of some nice little ones for you this is ailswood street island street photo on the left that the road has dropped so we've got a nice little sort of stiff staircase effect with the um footpath which isn't very safe I've snapped scent and solved that several times and nothing has ever happened and you can see when it rains it doesn't actually drain and my poor geriatric blind jack presley fell off it one day which was quite sad too and flockton street has now got a new flocked basin the road just keeps slumping away but fortunately it's slowing the traffic down so every cloud does have a silver lining and you know this is the state of some of our footpaths it's pretty sad and I think it's really important that the maintenance budget across the city is actually able to meet the need that we're not just going around and continuing to sweep the ac and just not do basic maintenance this is just around the corner in ferguson street where the roads are in quite poor condition as well you know they're just breaking that's quite sad've got drainage thank god um we finally started rebuilding at maruha primary maruha high school it's good to see some really lovely social housing going up and we're now getting more high density housing with infill housing we've got a temporary pump track at 10 shelly road and we have had nothing else since the earthquake really accept the motorway and traffic we need a really good budget for traffic coming and it needs to be holistic and there have been a couple of projects where it's been siloed off and that's not the way to deal with traffic we need the needs of the local community to be prioritised we lost our community centre um there were some decisions made post earthquake that caused a few issues around that and delayed the rebuild and then I think it's got the stage council's run out of money and have just put it on the back burner now this is um an article from the last long-term plan written and stuff about how shirley was a forgotten suburb and without a community centre park which is really great but we want something for the wider community so we need meeting spaces we need civic credit spaces we want a modern library and we want a community hub looking across the city the facilities that work well are the ones that have got multiple things on one side it's a beautiful sight backing on to dudley creek and I think to create a legacy for the future residents of that area would be really wonderful after what they've been through we've got a really diverse population and we're all ratepayers too would like to be considered when you're making decisions so thank you any questions thank you um we'll come to the end of the three minutes but um I mean you've you've made a very powerful presentation joe so thank you very much sorry are we gonna break okay thank you joe would you like to see I guess there's a minimum for 10 shirley road the reinstatement of the actual budget that was on in the uh 2015 long term plan I i the short term but I think we need to start doing some planning I think if we use money from the sale of properties on slater street and hills road we use money from either the sale or rent of the current library site and we accumulate the money from development fees I think we could soon get enough money to restore that site and do what the community wants on that site but you want a properly funded planning framework for your community we do and we're realistic that it may not be in the short term yeah okay thank you very much very helpful
So um I'm here to talk about the coastal erosion at pigeon bay and in particular uh where it's threatening holmes bay road um homes bay road services 22 residences uh provides access to the council waste and recycling facilities and it's a road popular for recreation for walkers cyclists motorcyclists but more importantly it provides an alternative access route out of pigeon bay but also to acharoa devotional if there's an issue in state highway 75. so it's reasonably important road gets you out over to portland out to littleton harbour if you look at the photo um the one in the submission um you'll see it's pretty close like there's less than two meters there and it's going to start washing out the road um and that's going to happen within the next 10 years so whether there's funding allocated now and the capital plan or not something's gonna have to be done one way or another I guess the things to note is there's four point two four point two million dollars allocated to the governor's beta allendale seawall so I guess really all we're asking is just some some money maybe from those budgets are allocated towards solving this problem um and as pam said the community's happy to help out um do whatever we can to help um and and it's potentially not you know a relatively a massive amount of money to solve a problem that will become much bigger if we don't do something about it that's pretty much it from me so what would a ryan have an interest in this as well I'm just looking at the picture yeah I've spoken to them and they a couple of years back they came and put in a big sleeve is what they call it and they seem pretty relaxed with it I'm not as relaxed as what they seem to be if you look at the picture um but yeah they seem pretty reluctant to do much about it it just it does seem to me that that's quite vulnerable like that yeah all right I've got some thank you very much that's good to have these brought to our attention cool thank you very much the next one is uh
You thanks hello I'm christina stahisky I did my masters in doctoral research on the relationship between fiction and identity in new zealand and I've spent 27 years teaching literature at the university here are some points to persuade you to keep the libraries as they are any philip pullman fans no philip pullman fans well if if you will you are okay you can tell the others yeah well here's a bit of a guru and who says after nourishment shelter and companionship stories are the thing we need most in the world why do we need them through stories we share passions fears sadness hardship and joys and we find common ground with other people so that we can connect and communicate with them stories are universal conveying meaning and purpose that helps us understand ourselves better and find commonality with others research shows that regular reading improves brain connectivity increases your vocabulary comprehension empowers you to empathize with other people it aids in sleep readiness reduces stress lowers blood pressure and heart rate fights depression symptoms and prevents cognitive decline as you age further a publication called basic and applied social psychology that found reading fiction significantly increased empathy towards others especially people the readers initially perceived as outsiders it is foreigners people of a different race skin color or religion three quotes to finish the first is from oprah winfrey she says books were my past to personal freedom william styron if you don't know him he's an american novelist he wrote sophie's choice way back which lots of people thought was um a heart-rending novel when he says reading the best state yet to keep absolute loneliness at bay and groucho marx outside of a dog a book is a man's best friend inside of a dog it's too dark to read so um please keep the libraries exactly as they are um people need them wherever they love and whenever they can get there thank you there's been a lot of focus on the libraries but I think sorry no no no it's a good thing it's a good thing um melanie um this isn't a question but it's just about community group that's good so I've got no time left thank you thank you
Good afternoon I know that the the long term plan has the same time of um action is this critical decade of climate change and it seems to me that we need to have a much more forceful response by the city during the term of its plan and I note that the long-term plan provides all funding for climate change strategy actions and I wonder where the millions that will be required for this is identified in the long-term plan it's a very complex document I know the long-term plan but I haven't seen many millions in it for climate change a suitable action one action could be to subsidize by loans the installation of solar panels on residential industrial roofs meaning that the payback would be about 10 years out but it would provide an improved power network infrastructure and community solar to maximize the benefits um your your leaflet queried whether rates water and waste spending was appropriate I think that all looks okay to me but I think we should invest in our transport infrastructure by increasing the public ev charging facilities and prioritizing fuel budgets our facilities I fully support that we need to maintain our facilities for communities and we should retain and extend public transport services and certainly retain the foreign louise community pool which is discussed on and off recently and I suggest you could delay the metro sports and stadium white elephants to provide necessary funding for that if we had to and certainly don't build an airport in terrace our heritage for sure in parks one item that drops out of that is that that a more economical route for the 360 pathway which is an excellent idea generally that but it should not pass through the estuary bird century which is it currently proposes that it should the current work on the coastal pathway includes a 40 kilometer speed limit in part of monk's bay it would be much better if this 40 kilometer speed limit was extended right through the reckless residential and village center we've asked for that to happen before and we're told that it will be considered in the village center project but we've recently heard that that should be part of the current coastal pathway project and two signs and two road markings so in fact the two signs and road markings that are in that project just need to be extended out to the uh where the school is funding for the art center certainly we must support the art center and funding for the base isolation of the robert mcdougall art gallery well I don't really support that because it's a very strong building it's stood up to the earthquakes pretty well it just needs to be repaired and reopened preferably as an adjunct christchurch city art gallery in the park which would do beautifully not part of the canterbury museum I mean I think that agreement to give the gallery to the museum should be rescinded if it's actually already whether or not it's been signed I don't know so are there any questions thank you but uh the times come to an end but thank you very much for what is a very thoughtful and um in-depth submission so it's much appreciated thank you thank you
Okay hi I am brian lodge a resident of foster terrace littleton the residents of foster and gilmore terrace who have boundaries that back up to the urimo reserve have major concerns around the fire buffer that is clearly the limit delineated on the council draft development plan the draft development plan also indicates that the area above the bench track which runs along behind the houses on foster terrace is to be planted with locally sourced native plants the urmc that's the reserve management committee has very little consultation with residents on how to implement the fire buffer in the rural development plan they have instead initiated a native fire buffer on the boundary of residents properties current urmc thinking has no consideration of managing the rural slash urban interface instead the committee is creating an area where there is no hard distinction between rural slash urban spaces which only increases fire spreading from or to the reserve the focus of urmc has been to plant a native green border in the fire buffer area along the boundary of residents properties this planting does not take into account reserve plantings to the residence plantings we also question how effective the native green border would be in its current position against the considerable and growing buildup of fuel in the reserve many flax and cabbage trees have been planted throughout the fire buffer and are poorly maintained with many dead leaves either hanging from plants or laying on the ground around them many of the low flammability natives in the reserve which may play a role in fire suppression are not being properly maintained also large areas of course and more muhlenbeckia highly flammable are growing just on the other side of the bench track in an area designated as a native planting area in some areas they're less than 10 meters from residents boundaries we the residents would like to see a clearly delineated space between the urban and rural areas and the fire buffer needs to be curated there is plenty of space in the reserve to plant natives in the area designated for native plantings not just on residents boundaries also the lack of consultation with residents some of whom have already removed trees and is a fire the liability will be on the city christchurch city council if the fire was to start and reserve and burn residents houses this could be a plan for all of the littleton port hills area on how to actually deal with the urban rural interface and how we actually go about designating areas and clearing them in a fire buffer zone this is obviously something that needs to be done this summer would be the driest I have seen it out there and I've been there since 2004. some of the people have lived there since the 1970s and they said they've never seen it so dry so we're very lucky you know thank you very much I actually was a bit disturbed when I read your submission and I thought um that it would benefit from a different approach you know more of a workshop with relevant staff um you know in terms of well we've spoken with the manager the reserve management committee and one of the things that we'd like to possibly see is a subcommittee developed which actually across the whole littleton basin I agree thank you that's a very excellent suggestion thank you very much thank you
Malcolm thank you hello to all the counselors I'm you've all got this haven't you sir yes okay so I'm not going to speak to I'm going to come in at about 1.4 just to wish you every success in your battle for the water and to control our own water instead of being bulldozed through in wellington that would be fantastic for a success there but it's going to be very hard I support you wholeheartedly the sticks river I'm here again madame mayor to say that the lower sex river the maintenance is a disgrace and I often wonder if the worksheet has ever checked with the job not done this goes on and on but that's the lowest stick river not the rest of it the infrastructure of our city many people drive their cars to work and leave them there which you'd know but for women there is completely different lifestyle as they look after their children and all their interests their elderly and they use their cars across the day so I do hope and I making it more and more difficult in many ways for drivers of cars but actually the women and the family have a whole separate form of needing transport compared to the one on businessman or the one on this because that needs to be taken into consideration have a slight feeling that the committee must be all male sometimes the council long-term plan uses of the words of council policy and demonstrated need now take the warranty pool as a local example and consider that the future if it was shut this is a major and has been for a long time local swimming pool for the area the pri the same problem exists for the local libraries and other aspects there as you get the bigger and the better and the central you're losing very precious and necessary local facilities therefore it's not necessarily the local opinion in local council that agrees at all with council policy and demonstrated need they're absolutely different in many circumstances I fear you're going down the road of having bigger brighter and better whereas the treasured local is being for these places um the arts center I i wondered in the paper today they haven't got enough projects apparently and I'm wondering if we could call that a shovel ready it's more than a shovel ready it's half ready and most magnificently done and it seems to me that if we could get this finished and completed it is you know within the country not with it just within our city a superb example of the architecture of the city so I'd look at that as possible funding from if they haven't got the funding spent see if they give us some while we push this job for the future quicker than it's going at the moment and how long it's going to take the highest quality and I'd love to see that finished I support the base isolation of the robert mcdougall gallery I think there'd be outrage if you decided to pull that down and yes it's not seen from where it is but it is and could be the function of the overall arts um very special but it is in in limbo sadly it needs to be done in order to move on uh the potential of local vacant sites just take a look at how long south hagley park has been still and in an appalling state south it's on the corner south hadley park and dean's avenue it's now parking for the hospital but that's been allowed to be there as long as I think I've lived in this city so I really think I applaud you for saying that's just not good enough to have waste lands just sitting there idle the trees I would park them all over the sea it refers mainly to the avon river project but I think they're the only umbrella of beauty in an otherwise boring flat city and so we must plant both native and introduced species wherever we can and love them but just make sure they're not too low near their local neighbors who complain when they get too big but where you see them where you have them in the city they are terrace down the river here it was beautiful today and the flowers the whole thing is very special finally I've noticed over the last few years I'm not a great computer person I think has sort of represent a lot of people of my age and I think I know you'll say refer to the computer but I read the newspaper and the newspaper of this council work is getting less and less and less I don't know if any of you read the newspaper there's no uh information or reporting of what actually happens here so this is why you get people that say it's too hard it's too hard I'm not going to get involved which is a great pretty there's a big headline today about the mobile library so I mean the the press is covering some of these issues that are yeah yes I know there's a little bit did you see you used to have a report it used to be on page two and it used to be almost all council news I know like that because in college I think if we wanted that we'd have to pay for it as well it's called advertising but they said that that's the trouble with everything they have to pay for it and that is for people there's a whole page of people that didn't get involved in the annual plan and the stuff I think was the start yeah and they didn't know about it they didn't get involved that tells you it's not right no you are local you're representing the local and there should be a bridge between the two in my opinion yeah okay thank you very much can I just say three minutes is not long enough for people to talk to listeners that is absolute insult to the public have read the document driven in here paid their parking field walked here and sat and waited it is an insult this is local this is the only chance they have and for my time I love the annual plan it was awesome very interesting thank you thank you very much
And we'll get underway um the first submission for the day is federated farmers thank you amish good afternoon my name is hamish crore I am the facilitator for federated farmers on bank spencer branch can I can I just interrupt sorry and I don't mean to be rude but given there's you annabelle pam do you all want to come to the table and take the time collectively yeah okay edible yeah so along with my wife annabelle and three kids we we've 426 hectares with me today is nick clark federated farmers policy manager pam richardson a farmer and a former member of the bank's financial community board and also my wife annabelle crore the vast majority of federated farmers members within christchurch city reside in farm on bank exponential award you've seen our submission and hopefully hopefully you've read it we want to focus our time on the proposal on this proposal to extend the land drainage rate to cover the whole district not just those currently serviced by the council land drainage infrastructure the vast majority of which is unfair and should be scrapped 80 percent of remote rural rate players do not currently pay the land rate and drainage rate because they are unserviced by this infrastructure the average rates increase for the remote rural property which is unserviced will double from 5.8 percent to 11.5 percent in 2021-22 with similar increases to take place over the following years over the transition period to a full capital value rate the consultation documents table was misleading given that 80 percent of remote rural rate payers do not pay the land range rate it is at best only accurate for 20 who do currently play that rate personally we'll see our rates increase by one thousand eight hundred and thirty six dollars for a service that we do not receive with those directly benefiting seeing their contribution decrease to little over two hundred dollars to be fully serviced on top of that farmers also do a lot of work at their own expense to manage excess water on their properties to comply with the new fresh water and biodiversity statements we also are deeply concerned about the process for talk about the process right the process it was an abysmal process the the information was misleading uh a letter date of the 30 30th of march was very belatedly sent to affected property owners but not received until after easter and most poorly of all the council made no attempt that we can discern to engage with interested parties while developing its thinking I even knew about it in my board days when I was chair we are pulled by by the substance and the proposal of the process and this proposal should be ditched and instead a proper consultations process should be undertaken and so one district council has an example of that where they've got a district-wide rate and they're working this through with a particular process so annabelle do you want to say orbit okay so I'm the other half of hamish so I won't spend the time introducing myself but we found in lithuania on banks peninsula we operate a sheep and beef farm we have accommodation venture and do significant restoration projects on our property we pay 10 840 in as hamish mentioned in the first year we'll see an increase of six hundred and twelve dollars because of the land drainage rate and one thousand eight hundred and thirty six dollars over the next three years which is a 16.94 increase and this does not include the five percent approximate general increase that will be coming across all all ratepayers we do not approve of this simply because we do not benefit publicly from the maintained drainage infrastructure there are no storm water pipes no curbing channeling or swells on from our property or in our community all water leaving our property and other rural properties are via natural resources such as soil streams creeks wetlands and roading drains as a rural landowner we carry out the cost and responsibility of maintaining surplus water from our properties through managing our pasture levels to absorb maximum moisture grazing management maintenance of farm tracks culverts and drains and we personally pay and install for culverts and drains on a formed public road that boundaries our property and con in the consultation document justification was given that all council land owners more pleasant and livable city we slightly take insult to that given that we really visit akaroa visit icaroa and christchurch and why should we be charged 1836 dollars for maybe the six visits that we make to christchurch in a year lastly under the national policy statement for fresh water management as landowners and farmers we are required to carry out the following things waterway setbacks for stock exclusion wetland management for stock exclusion and biodiversity management and significant farm planning requirements would urban ratepayers be prepared to do the same and fund all our fresh water management requirements like we are being expected to fund urban infrastructure as an active member of the bank peninsula rural community through my role on the banks peninsula conservation trust and the devotional primary school board I must express total disbelief and outrage by the community at this proposal and the lack of understanding of the financial implications of this rate and we strongly propose oppose it thank you thank you thank you thank you nick do you want to carry on I'll just um I'll just sort of wrap to see things go as as we've said very eloquently from my my colleagues um you know strong preferences for this to be this really inequitable unfair and oppressive rate proposal to be ditched and and we just look at the various other um you know the cell when example we're there where they are looking to propose something similar but they are looking to do a proper consultative process they're establishing a committee to look into this issue to to work out whether and if so how such a rate would be developed I'll point out a couple of examples of other councils that have a similar approach in the sense of having a district-wide contribution to basically land drainage stormwater and for example in tasman district unserviced properties pay a capital value rate but it's differentiated at 0.1005 not 100 but not 100 at all so that's a tenth of the capital value and in south and district which has a which takes a slightly different approach they have uniform um targeted rate for stormwater which is 47 for a service property different approaches that we would um commend to the council um when considering this issue um thank you thank you um I think that I mean you're not the first people to talk about the effectiveness of the communication so or lack thereof and in particular I was just I noted that a letter that was dated the 13th of march wasn't received until after easter it was dated the 30th of march not the 13th the 30th of march and of course of course it didn't arrive till after easter then no so and that then limited the submission time quite considerably and and you say that there's been no discussion with federated farmers at all in relation to the proposal any time over the last year or anything like that no no has anyone else got questions uh jimmy and andrew may ask a question at moment y'all knows canterbury federic farmers you know how many farmers have paid the the the rates the land rate I mean yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah so based on information we received from the council're around about um two and a half thousand people give or take who who are on who are what they call remote rural ratepayers yes um across the district most of them will be in the bank's peninsula ward 78 so virtually eighty percent do not currently pay the rate because they do not get the service okay thank you thank you thank you andrew thank you um the bank's principal community board suggested that this be um in their submission suggested that this be deferred for a year so that further engagement could take place and further work could be done um would would you support the view of the bank's peninsula community board yeah I think we would would really support that would also support working with staff to understand the issues and how we all fit into the jigsaw puzzle and you know more fairly reflect the rate and reflecting comments that you made earlier presumably you would want federated farmers to be one of the groups that was engaged in that work that went on over the next year or so in you thank you very much and thank you I think it's much more effective actually to have the group of you presenting together in that way it made it very very clear and all of your points were covered off in the submission so thank you very much so that was to do with the land drainage rate um my one um will you just all have a good look at the submission and just see what I've written please um yes if I'm not going to get that opportunity to talk about them that's fine oh sorry I yeah okay yeah I thought that everything was generally covered off but if if you want to take another few minutes I mean I i I mean I yeah I thought by grouping them it would be easier well I did talk about the land drainage ratings as well yeah but I also um I would just say work with communities local solutions and then I wanted to give an accolade at the end but I was talking about the land drainage rate um the closure of hub and working through with the community it was not worked through with the community so there it is work with communities find local solutions the akara wastewater is the same thing the akara drinking water we need to look at resolving that drinking water situation better supply increase storage for the community and perhaps we need to go as far as looking at district planning rules to make sure that we all perhaps have composting toilets somebody said to me this morning well we've raised the purple line too with central government too is it purple line is that what it's called purple pipe so that we can remember and the last thing was about the pigeon bay area and the erosion around the foreshore I showed you some photographs look absolutely magnificent in the in the agenda today look at those we want a solution where we can go out and do that working with council to resolve it and put in a wall in right now and don't want to have to go through a whole consenting process something simple something easy we can accolade at the bottom of the page well the accolade at the bottom of the of my submission um talked about you know just want to close with our community thanks for the support council staff including the parks team community board staff facilities team provide to the reserve management committees picture bay hall committee using our local community skills that along with council support we have achieved so much so yeah that was just an accolade we all thank you the next one
Maryland in front of you but this is I'm not marilyn no sorry to disappoint marilyn's over here thank you cool right kia ora tina koto katoa thank you for having me here today I think I'm lucky last which is quite exciting does that mean I get an hour no okay no I'll keep it to my five so you've all had our submission so we're just going to address a couple of those points and just reiterate um what our thoughts are there so we are a community organisation advocating for our hour and we advocate for ecological restoration for the entire avon autocado red zone land area leading on from our submission on behalf of our committee I want to highlight a couple of points we asked the council to bring more of its spend into the avon autocado river corridor over the next three years from our research there appears to be no council even autocado river corridor regeneration spend in the first three years just mowing which is a 2.8 million per year maintenance fee all the money budgeted funds like the christchurch regeneration acceleration fund this was money allocated by the crown in 2019 there is no regeneration money coming from the council till 24 25 we ask for those funds to come in starting in the next three year period we asked the council to engage more in a collaborative and co-designing process for infrastructure components in the red zone corridor it is crucial that council involve relevant stakeholders in those discussions so that for example stop banks flow seamlessly into regenerating eco systems and with project partners it's also worth noting that stop banks and regeneration go hand in hand we also noticed that spend for stop banks was not clear or detailed enough for us to comment effectively on but from what we have read and understand we don't feel that the money that's allocated for stock banks will do them right we ask the council to outline exactly what money is allocated for the stock banks what is actually covered as part of that and what is not covered and what the shortfall is because we do believe there is a infrastructure budgets not just for the avon autocad red zone but the whole city lighting should be a primary consideration and is fundamental to environment to environmental health we initiated and still support the dark sky park concept for the avon autocado river corridor and support the submission under the urban star watch christchurch we asked the council to also consider community-led restoration as an option for ecological restoration this was not mentioned in the long-term plan but it is a cheaper option and also engages local communities and groups like us some further feedbacks and comments in general we ask that the long-term plan be clearer and more detailed with the financials it was really hard to know what the allocation of funds were covering in a detailed way and if it would be enough there was not enough financial detail that was easily accessible to public to make well-informed recommendations we proposed just giving us a spreadsheet with what all the spend allocations budgets and time frames were while the document gave wordy details which were helpful to a point it didn't give us the financial detail detailed financials when we're essentially feeding back to you on where to spend the money if those spreadsheets were there then it wasn't easy to find and that is some good feedback too we would like to see better engagement and communication with general public and interest groups for the avon autocad river corridor this is both about co-design and communication there is a lot of expertise in our groups out not just ours but some of the other project proponents and experts who are often hitting some of those proposals that are going to be in the corridor over the next decade or so but they are not being consulted please be open to using us and collaborating a communication example is as peter was stating the governance model for the avon autocad river corridor two years on and we're still in the same place no governance model it is truly disheartening and with a real lack of comms from the council about the real situation we know there's stuff going on but it's not being communicated to the wider public as a volunteer a number of documents that were difficult to know where to find the information that we wanted please remember that many of us don't have all the time in the world we are volunteers for what we do and it's not possible to go through all these documents with a fine-tooth comb but it would be great if it was made easier for us to engage many of us struggling juggling jobs families and volunteer commitments and we're also getting burned out so please be mindful of this in the volunteer community of christchurch to finish we asked the council to continue to represent the vision of avon autocado plan that was approved by the minister megan woods in 2019 which prioritizes ecological regeneration this should not just be only for the green spine but the entire red zoned land and we would like that amended in the long term plan thank you thank you and thank you for your presentation um there's obviously uh and look I mean I'm not going to make excuses but covert 19 did have a major impact on last of the initial engagement with um naitahiri we have an agreement to work with them on developing the co-governance model and um and I'm going to be raising this and my mayor's report next week so fantastic um it's we haven't uh councillors haven't had a chance to to come up to speed with this either and um and yeah so all I can say is is that um the other side of it is that with the three waters in particular um challenges uh and in relation to the water issues with naitahu that it has been a very difficult time for both the council and naito huriri to commit the resources to the next phase but we are both committed yeah and um and and next week will signal just another step towards um getting that resolved um I don't we won't have a co-governance model agreed um before uh you know before the end of the year we'll but before the end of the year we will be back out to our community I'm confident uh with a there be an update in the short term yeah I think we've taken I'll have to I'll have to wear this myself but um yeah I had a few challenges last year that made things a bit more difficult for me as well so thanks but we are definitely committed and this is actually the opportunity to do something quite extraordinary and quite unique um in the world and um and I'm I'm I'm really looking forward to I think this is a this is a legacy project for the city absolutely yeah thank you very much so I think that's everyone who um was due to have a submission today who's here in the room and so I will now adjourn the meeting until 1pm tomorrow so thank you all very much you
We've had the message loud and clear thank you thank you so um yep okay well um peter beckel come forward now for eastern vision it's nice to be in the seat and seeing a lot of people I know your worship counselors good to be with you um I've actually been an anglican priest for nearly 50 years and it's a long time and uh part of what we do and have been being a part of our character is that we talk about dreams and visions and what gives meaning value and purpose in our lives and I guess that's kind of what I've come to you to talk about all of you have been elected to this council because you want to make a difference you want to improve the lives of our citizens and in our city and I thank you for wanting to do that in the book of proverbs in the bible as many of you I'm sure will have read um there's this verse if there is no vision the people perish I submit that enable the process of your vision for our city to be realized other submissions are addressing the detail of the ltp and I'm going to be happy to be joining haley who is hoping to be with me today but I'll be joining her tomorrow for the avon attack around network submission we'll be dealing more of the detail the stated vision of this council that is to say your vision counselors is this christ church is a city of opportunity for all open to new ideas new people and new ways of doing things a city where anything is possible I remember when gary moore was mayor he had a a kind of a vision which I quite liked too which was um in a sense he was saying christchurch is a city where all our children are cared for and loved I quite like that because it catched everything really in doing it so it's my understanding this vision statement guides you through your ltp and you are the guardians of this vision I make this submission on behalf of eastern vision which has years and been engaged with this council and many other groups representing the eastern suburbs and in particular the residential red zone of course in developing a long-term vision and strategy for the land we were delighted when in august 2019 uh megan woods uh honorable dr megan woods stated that the aventaka river corridor regeneration plan developed by regenerate christchurch had been approved under section 38 of the greater christchurch regeneration act of 2016. you will know as well of course that it provides a vision and objectives for short medium and long-term future land use and opportunities for this 602 hectare area of land in the heart of eastern christchurch you know that it was developed through a whole lot of wide-ranging collaborative consultation with many community groups and agencies not least with the input from avon attack around network and that great champion of the east evan smith at least I have to say we were delighted when it was approved and your perspective on the river park is stated in the way this way on your website and if you've read my submission it says opportunity to create a legacy that benefits future generations the areas potentially exciting provide a range of environment social and commercial benefits as we explore the ways to protect homes from the effects of climate change sea level rise and make the otaku river a healthier place for people and wildlife we know it won't happen over time over over immediately overnight but it will take time and we could estimate takes 30 to 50 years so the plan which you have endorsed we hope aims to create a restored native habitat and all the rest that goes with it now this ltp is intended to play a formative part in enabling that vision to be resized realized and last year I was privileged to be here in june as many of you were and I was here with the mayor when the petition of over 18 000 people which was sent to parliament in 1812 advocating for the park was ceremoniously returned to the council it was a very moving event as you know evan smith who was the champion of the river park was terminally ill and beamed in from his hospital bed in wesley care and he rejoiced this man who had led a campaign to get a red zone areas along the avantage turn into a park was given a promise by your worship that his dream will become a reality and we all endorse that that all looked well that was however on june the 30th this year the sections in the greater christchurch recovery act relating to recovery and regeneration plans will be revoked this means the plans no longer have statutory effect I'm pleased to note however that on the 24th of march this year you requested advice from your offices on adopting the avon otaka avon river corridor regeneration plan as council policy and strategy that's good news and I hope that's been confirmed but there's a big but after june the 30th it's in your hands as to how the river park will be developed and there are many groups wanting to have their projects as part of the the park who and how will decisions be made there's a very strong voice in any time that it continues to be in perpetual ownership of the council and can be leased and can be leased to various projects but that yet there is no governing entity being established to take responsibility for the governance of the river park conversations are progressing slowly with like turkey and with community groups like even even attacker network in developing a co-governance entity and it's great to hear that which honours the dream and I was made aware today from daryl from your office uh your worship that you will be discussing and raising these issues again and developing them with this council over the next few days that's good news it's urgent we need to get a decision made because there are lots of projects that want to move on and they the temptation you may have is to agree on an ad hoc basis to some of these projects it's not the way to go it puts the car before the horse we have to have a governing body that overrides that overlooks the whole thing before you start making decisions about hoc decisions because that would put in jeopardy the opportunity we have to deliver on the dream and vision this kawapapa so I submit that the successful implementation of the ltp in what was called the residential red zone is dependent on their being formed a community-based co-governance entity which protects the vision and objectives of the river park as envisioned in the river park plan and I've gone over time and I apologize gone over time but that's okay because that means that haley was able to hear the the very end of that so okay but um but we'll see you again tomorrow you'll see me again tomorrow thank you councillors thank you very much how are you going jeremy all right and
Yep thank you okay I'll work off the paper copy and mention when I'm going on to the next slide thank you okay well good afternoon look um I live in the ricketton ward and on the deprivation index at the four highest details uh ricketton ward has the worst figures in christchurch by far okay five percent are in the least deprived details but there we are on 64.7 now I actually live in the central ricketten part of rickardon and if you look at the next slide it says that 77 earn an annual income of under 50 000. only six percent earn an annual income over seventy thousand and I think it's really important councillors especially on the salaries that you are on and that the majority of people working for the council are on that you do remember this when you contemplate putting rate increases these are real people earnings working six days a week on the minimum wage or minimum wage plus 50 cents one dollar it's very tough out there and many of these people that were full-time and now's the thing about central wreckage or our area the current population far exceeds the limit for medium density households per hectare we're way over 75 their households per hectare in the central ricketten area and I know the mayor visited with us on a walk about a few years ago and was quite surprised at the density then it's unabated I can tell you and what what is really concerning is that you have proclaimed yourselves a climate emergency council yet investors and developers are being allowed to replace every tree shrub blade of grass what with concrete gravel bark and this is masquerading as landscaping now in really developed cities I go to a country each year which would be a second world country not a first world country but even there they use in the capital uh these big machines that take out trees with the whole root structure attached so the trees can be planted somewhere else they don't lose the trees it's really important I think that the council investigate this aspect okay so 74 of our residents in central rickerton of 29. ricketton is not an old person suburb as it might have been perceived some years ago so exponential increase in population in our area since the 2011 earthquakes but what's happened okay so the council has been stripping ricketton or proposing to strip rickerton of its facilities the population increases the council proposals let's get rid of facilities it doesn't make sense the library for example look we agree with uh council macdonald okay they come from different parts of money but we're talking 80 odd thousand from mobile library and yet the council is prepared to say 240 000 for four one-bedroom flats that will only enrich three owners the mobile library enriches everybody in christchurch and we really want you to take that into account one of the most bizarre proposals here in this document is to rid the foreign swimming pool from our area there's been no swimming pool in christchurch that has done more for multicultural activities than the foreign swimming pool 22 000 people went through that pool in one month this year it is really really important to take more account to the bus lounges in a moment because this again is an extraordinary decision but hey ricketton had a good community centre it wasn't gold plated but it was really well used and what's happened we've been given a building one floor of which we're able to occupy it isn't even called a community center anymore it's not like the one that's in albans or sumner if you've been there they community centers the one at ricketton is half hereford street and half sort of for the community plus a post office plus a service center so we've lost out really big time on that but let's look at the bus lounges okay you received a report from council in december of last year that said and I put this on the slide the bus lounges are a key connecting hub on ecans network linking passengers to other services enabling them to get to work home or other areas around the city all right so there's 800 plus movement bus movements a day stopping at because of the routes that go up and down rickett and road so it could get to over 850 in the near future I gave presentation to ecan on tuesday morning they are fully supportive the chairperson said we are aware of what is contemplated and he can will be letting you know what they feel about it but every counselor was in agreement of the importance of these bus lounges but hey wait a minute this is the same council that wants people to use public transport so what's an incentive to use public transport or close the bus lounges come on councillors that doesn't make sense it's not logical it's not rational to start closing bus lounges okay after you've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on them I have let you um run over time quite a lot so um if you if you could well if I could just say that if you read this thing about the report and the fact that people that use the lounges weren't even consulted 46 uh 48 percent of our population are not we're hearing the message loud and clear the community board was very clear on the matter as well and you know that they would like to see them retained so so thank you very much
Thank you very much cheers chris kisling christchurch civic trust uh thank you very much for this opportunity there are more than financial implications to consider in the long term plan virtually all decisions taken in the short term have long term consequences because we are dealing with the built environment and how we operate within the constraints of that environment we in new zealand are profligate users of energy on a per capita basis energy is not free how we use energy has implications for climate change council acknowledged this we are a coastal city vulnerable to rising sea levels moving inland impacts land use and loss of agricultural land energy is used to construct and to knock down energy is used when we physically access places conditioned by what choices we have to get about energy is used in the home at work at play in fact in all our activities but do we evaluate planned alternatives from an energy conservation and efficiency perspective not very well our submission indicates our concerns with respect to heritage funding disposal of some city assets the future of the robert mcdougall transport systems it's not just about infrastructure it is also about coordination and operational matters that facilitate convenient point-to-point access within acceptable time frames we also see the necessity for more rigorous protection of open space assets particularly hagley park the council as both administrator and advocate is often in a conflicted situation as a promotional agent and has designated protector of a very significant heritage asset there are legal requirements involved sadly too often sidestep for political expediency as in the application of the hagley park management plan I'm leaving you time to ask questions thank you for making this verbal presentation possible execution within five minutes as many are pointed out severely limits potential dialogue so if we don't get the questions now we're quite happy to have written questions from here which we will respond to thank you very much thank you that's very helpful um do I have any any questions thanks um have you looked at our pt futures business case that we've put forward to central government I haven't personally know I guess I'm just kind talked about public transport yes but we've already submitted the business case to central government so I've if you want the timing's kind of quickly answering you on on public transport um I've heard propositions that we shouldn't be making the existing bus uh operations within the four avenues if you get on and off within the four avenues it should be free but I still say that um we need in the inner city area we need an inner orbiter we have an orbiter service bus service which ties them together quite well out out in the suburbs but not in the central city I find walking across this central city quite difficult given a leg condition I have it I had do not cannot use the bus services for that and I am just one of many citizens in that situation so it's not an either or situation it's not either or rail transport or bus transport or those types it is the integration of those and the proper management and operation and I could give you a lot of time sort of look back at the yellow bus that was um provided but you know I mean after the earthquakes that was that was um discontinued and and christchurch city council wasn't didn't have any buses to just put back into the into the system so which is why we asked ecam to to make it part of the public transport system um but as we know we haven't got an integrated public transport system um here or anywhere else in the country actually but um you have no one authority looking after it you got two yes but if you've got even if you had one authority managing a ridiculous system doesn't solve the problem I'm interested so I want the system fixed and then we'll have it please thank you thanks for that um
Missed me really smooth rosemary would you like to it looks as if okay come up as close as you can because I think being close to the microphone is important hello christine as well we are here representing the national council of women christchurch branch which has been concerned about a number of different issues in the long term plan but we decided that we would focus on one particular thing that was of significant importance to our members and for which christine hathaway who's sitting next to me and who's been involved in ncw for longer than I have been um so she's been a member and a representative uh currently a representative of the association of african women and my name is rosemary dupasi and I'm co-president of national council of women at the moment so we decided we're going to focus our attention on the issue of mobile libraries and I was very pleased to hear outside this building that that you've had a number of different submissions on this particular topic so what I'll do is I'll but I won't go through all of it and that will be the general issues and the position of ncw christchurch branch and then christine will talk will provide you with some personal experience that's very relevant to why we think this is a very important issue so ncw christchurch branch opposes the proposed cut to mobile library services it was one of the things that although people didn't always read the small print when they realized it was there they were deeply concerned about at 91 000 a year as I understand it we do not see this as an expensive service but an absolutely crucial one on which many elderly residents in retirement visit villages depend in very important ways it's also a vital service for all city residents who do not have conventional forms of mobility so if you have any form of mobility disability and you have to use buses taxis and other ways to get at your hard copy box having a mobile library service in the vicinity of your home is really important or in the vicinity of the form important to recognize that a cut to these services affects not only those who are older and those with disabilities but it is also important for schools that are not in walking distance of our branch libraries which are absolutely wonderful and it's really important to encourage children's engagement with print books with hard copy books at a time when a huge amount of their access and their reading is occurring on digital devices so as a women's organization that focuses on the needs of women and children and with a very strong commitment to public services that meet the needs of all those with disabilities and the most vulnerable and the oldest and the youngest members of our community we urge you as a council to reconsider this component of the cutbacks to library services and now I'm going to turn to christine who will talk about the importance of the service at a much more personal level I think we need to remember that while we've got shirley and parklands and other malls with library facilities attached there are some areas particularly miraval and a number of elderly people in that area my mother for one would go down to the library mobile library every monday morning up until the time she went into full care which was only two years ago and she and at 101 she absolutely loved that library and um spent every monday morning making sure she had books and I believe that we've got to consider that and consider the number of retirement villages that the mobile library goes to as well as the costs a lot there are other ways of making it work there are other ways of saving money but I don't believe that the mobile library is a good one and I urge you to reconsider the whole funding for the mobile library and reconsider the service it is doing in the community I think the other point that was made when we discussed this with members is that some people remembered after the canterbury earthquakes when a lot of the libraries were closed the mobile library service was crucial in getting to some communities and providing uh the service of books crisis we have as a city so the mobile library service and having that service is something that you don't want to go give up when we can face civil emergencies in the future the other the other agendas associated with that are that the mobile library service and the librarians who go out know their communities and they know the people who use those services so it's not just a matter of a physical van with books in it it's a matter of someone who goes regularly into those communities and interacts with the people who use the service and gets books for them and encourages people if you like this well then maybe you'd like that so they genuinely act as librarians in a way that is hugely important particularly for people who have not grown up with experience in using digital media and I don't know whether you saw the article in the media where ann brown was saying that she in the retirement village she's in she goes into the mobile library every week and makes sure that she gets librarians know what he needs what he wants and they select out the books that he knows she will he will enjoy and I think that's another thing that a lot of people that go into retirement villages and other places they haven't got transport they have they can't always get to a district library thank you and I but we've had a number of submissions on this as you've highlighted and thank you very much for focusing on the on the issue um we've canvassed you know whether there's there are potentially other options for delivering the service I think people were after the service as opposed to the um necessarily an investment in particular methodology for delivering but um anyway that's what we'll take into account and thank you very much for making um your time available to come and submit to us so thank you are there any questions no that's good we've run out of time we're just sticking to the a reasonable time frame that's great thank you very much for listening
Thank you very much for your submission thank you everyone thank you vicky do you want to go I don't get out of it now do I that's all right I can actually see why are you waiting for someone else no no it's all good she'll be sweet I'll just um tell her I bluffed it um no it's all good I'm just interesting I see there my name spelt vicky payton it's probably a guy I know isn't it tremendous well it is a tad but I was grateful that I didn't get into dhb because they spelt my name like that so you know there are actually some benefits of getting my name spelt incorrectly but that's okay I won't slash my wrists and bleed all over the wooden floor it could be a bit messy um I guess the reason for my being here is actually with regards to the potential closure of the akura and littleton service centres um look you know it's really awkward isn't it I mean I've why the decision has been made to take that into consideration I mean you've got something you've got to make sure it's cost effective and all the details that go with it I do wonder though um when a business isn't profitable usually you go through and do a health check and I know many of you will understand that you check to see what's actually wrong how we can make that actually more beneficial and obviously you know profitable which is a really big deal when you're in the council as well um there is a little bit of a concern there because you know best practice is to ensure that the rate payers are covered with all the bits and pieces and and all the services and needs that are required it seems to me that um you know just giving you a short education for those people that don't actually um aren't familiar with littleton it was actually the bridal path itself is constructed in 1850 in the late 1850s and it was the first path that actually the so it's now turned itself around and I'm sitting here groveling trying to get the service centre kept open so you know the but the bridal path does actually have a lot of historical um things about it but so does littleton and I do feel that maybe and I wasn't party to obviously the discussions that everybody had about getting rid of the service centre but I do maybe think that it might be a little bit hasty to totally eradicate its existence so when we were talking to the business association we have nearly 100 members if not more in climbing which is a really good indication that there's now a lot of people that are working from home there's a lot of businesses there in the discussion with them a lot of them are actually now showing a huge growth in their businesses as well which is pretty unusual in the current climate that we've had to experience and we cannot say that that's all due to tourists because of course we haven't really had terrorists so a lot about it is that there is a number of full service centres available why didn't this happen to some of them why didn't they get reduced and I'm guessing it's numbers there was a number of upgrades that were made to the existing service centers why were our ones neglected um you know maybe some of those numbers that you get are from people like governors bay that go to beckenham that makes sense you drive over from governor's bay to beckenham I wonder if the discussion has been made that you know for littleton and akara to use the service centers in the other areas they're going to actually have to catch two buses does anybody call a bus do they know how much two buses cost yeah I love buses sorry so yes if you do it within a certain period of time but that doesn't that doesn't make up for the fact it's still two buses and if you're an elderly person that's got a disability that would suck um internet and phone connection is often pockets are you aware of that andrew do you actually get phone reception up there I know I sold you the house years ago but I can't remember if the phone worked up there or was that a long time ago okay but any further up past andrews you're probably pretty shocked um we're encouraged to bike now I know that's a bone of contention with the council totally understand it but we have no cycle ways and judging by the size of me and the age of me biking over the bridal path is not going to work the feet is going to look pretty stupid we now have five petrol stations down ferry road inclusive of the four newly built ones is that a juxtaposition I can't figure that out we're encouraged to use cycleways but our carbon footprint is actually being compromised I've got a solution a number of people have spoken to have got a solution and really that's what it's about cut the cable for those that don't know what that is I'm not james you could explain to the people that aren't from christchurch cut the cable is at some stage or maybe put us back to a bank's financial account so well that's not going to happen is it or is it reduce the number of hours or days that the service centres are open and I mean all of them not just akaroa and banks you know little tim it's a thought because you know for every hour you take off all the others that might give us an hour make akira and littleton four service centers with reduced hours car registrations postal services etc market those services rationalize the work job job share employ someone to work a couple of days in one place and another I think they call it seagulling cross-train the staff some library part-timers might want to do it ensure that the cc person is on site once a month because that would be pretty cool to actually see someone's face taking into consideration the littleton harbour business association has a growing membership maybe it's time for us to consider that are made in our council and with some matters and obviously with a positive solution because that's what we want as positive for results rather than me coming in and being reactive it would be really cool for us to be proactive and look taking into consideration it's a unique geographic isolation separated by nature it's just a fact or maybe we could just regard littleton and akara service centers as our cycleways just a thought thank you very much was there any questions can I leave now we've come to the end of the time but thank you vicky that's that's um that's a very uh very clear submission thank you thank you very much and I think we will be looking at what options are available you know in terms of as you say hot desking and other arrangements that can be made but a creative account I would say hot desking rather than the hot desk isn't it you'd probably say that means something else well I thought about I thought well maybe you know someone on realized that I am one and you don't get paid for it so that's probably not going to be very useful but I don't know that you'd be paying rent for doing jp's no no no it's a tremendous service to the community so thank you but promise me you won't lose we won't lose our lives because I will slash my wrestling all over the floor so jamie and anybody else that might consider it please don't lose our library we are taking we are taking all matters into account and we have many more submissions to go so thank you so much thank you thanks guys thank you
 this a long time ago now james right thank you um my name is kit dudeny I'm the chairperson of the avon heathcote estuary hutai trust we were set up in 2002 and 2003 to represent the community's ideals for a better estuary and to try and restore the maori to that area of christchurch we're really pleased to be supported by both you guys as council and environment canterbury and we have memorandums of understanding with both of your esteemed organizations one of the things we have submitted on however is in the last 10 years our grant from the council to undertake our work we're all volunteers on my board but we do have a part-time half-time manager uh the incredible tanya jenkins you may have heard of her she organizes mother all cleanups estuary fest in concert with other community groups and has a real networking ability we've been fortunate enough to get some funding from christchurch city council of ten thousand dollars a year for the last 10 years which in concert with the environment canterbury's grant of twenty thousand dollars a year allows us to do what we do and over those ten years the work of the estuary trust has increased incredibly mainly to do with chinese abilities to do all these interacting sort of community work we do the restoration of wetlands for example which you may be aware of especially charlesworth but one of the things I wanted to ask you in the long term plan is to find out whether you be prepared to increase our funding from ten thousand dollars a year to fifteen thousand dollars a year we're under more and more pressure from rata foundation to reduce that funding and this year we're unable to get the fifteen thousand we're down to ten this year and I'm worried that tanya will be lost in this effort and we're also going to environment canterbury and their long-term plan with the same request of an extra five thousand dollars a year to um pay for tanya's good work so if you could consider that in your long-term planning I would most appreciate it as an adjunct to estuary a dedicated park ranger that is one of our last points in our submission we'd really appreciate a go-to park ranger for everything to do with the estuary at the moment we have various access to a couple of park rangers um depending on which side of the estuary we're dealing with so it'd be lovely to be able to actually have a park range dedicated to our work I would like to finally mention one aspect of our submission which is the estuary green edge pathway as you'll be aware the coastal pathway has been open since 2016. it's a marvelous asset to the community all the way along the south side of the estuary and we also have the opening of the south shore red zone pathway and that's being worked on at the moment is open to the public for walking with their dogs and companion animals and things so we really um actually oppose the opening project which is still underway by council to open the third side of the estuary to humans and their companion animals at the and the oxidation ponds which is a wildlife refuge with doc status our birds on the estuary as you'll be aware are incredibly shrinking every year in their number for every species and this protected wildlife reserve is incredibly important to the habitat of these birds and other creatures and the combination of moving between the estuary and the wildlife refuge is really important to keep humans away from that so as part of the um sort of idea of biodiversity we'd really like to keep humans out of that area and just have it for the animals so we would request that we rescind the green edge pathway route from this very sensitive area to another more appropriate one either through the middle of the pond or back and end of the ponds through bromley area which I think would be excellent thanks very much councillors any questions uh yes pauline thank you look we had a deputation this morning a submission um and the lady said that um occasionally people are allowed to go through there by permission do you also oppose that or do do you get permission that can be okay if you get permission for instance occasionally the 360 trail pathway um asks permission to go through and that that that's fine but what we really want is a restricted access to um all of us and mainly our dogs we also get horses um going across the estuary mud flats into the area and it's the only reserve that the birds have got away from us in our activities right thank you so so you'd be relatively comfortable if that was still based on a permission basis yeah then an open yeah that's right the difference okay good thank you not a permanent pathway thank you very much for your submission thank you everyone thank you
Thank you and um thank you very much for coming in and making the submission thank you uh and katrina hill anger clinton parish of east christchurch laura katrina thank you um thank you for giving me the time to speak to my submission which you've had in writing um I highlighted in my written submission the fact that there's no plan for budget to increase community housing in your long term plan um I just come here to say um how wise is that and then I even thought how does no plan to budget to to increase your community housing fit with your stated principles and your community outcomes um which are one prioritizing the social cultural and economic well-being of people and communities that's your priority and an outcome is sufficient supply of and access to a range of housing I am grateful that I have a council that acknowledges the need for access to housing however it needs to be actioned I come from the east side of christchurch so I all turn familiar with different people that come in that are struggling have a home provided like I do I must admit it's hard for me to imagine what it is like to go on a waiting list trying to get bumped up the ladder of being the most needy that is what you go through if the demand is more than the supply it is tough when you are at the bottom fighting for a basic need so I'm sorry to say but to have no strategy of increasing the community housing is a glinch in your armor of care for our wonderful city um I had a man that came into our center the other day life had been difficult but there was light at the end of the tunnel as he now had a hope so was more able to work change to work towards change and that hope was in the form of a council unit he had been waiting for and finally got it was great a he could afford it um b as long as he wasn't ridiculously behaved or became a millionaire it was permanent and see the landlord was available to there'll be a greater demand for accommodation for our aging population let alone younger ones we already know that we're in a housing crisis why would we not want to consider and plan for those in our community that have been presently squeezed and in the future more so as it isn't predicted to get any better so letting this glitch in your plan go unaddressed I think will be even more detrimental as it is already an identified need for more housing I also think the majority of people know that if you don't look after the vulnerable there becomes a spirit of meanness about who we are no council person should feel embarrassed about wanting to rectify this glitch in an otherwise otherwise good plan you are our leadership and good leadership your consultation document tells a story of what you do hope for on page 56 it says of the consultation document we also hope to work with others to increase the amount of community housing in christchurch you know it's it's needed and so I urge the council to plan long term plan and that should be a priority and I think it would be a wise decision for the future thank you thank you I mean that's a very helpful submission I think that uh it would be remiss if I didn't highlight that we we have uh got um our holdings company looking at how to develop further housing options but not included on the ratepayers side of things so I take your point that we do fund a lot of other things um but it is we've always and yes there has been an element of pride in that we haven't had to call upon the rate payers because of the initial investment that was made by central government about 40 50 whatever it was years ago in terms of the investment and and council housing around the country so we are looking at what options are and how we also support ocht the housing trust to develop further houses as well so we are it's definitely on our radar but it's not spelt out in the ltp because um we yeah so thank you very much yep that's great thank you thank you right so now we will adjourn for afternoon tea um and we're a little bit early yes
I'm sorry jeff I'm being hopeless that's okay that's fine kia ora and I'm sorry tena koto katoa it's jeff natala for your pronunciation your attempt I always say that so I am church manager for reckless baptist church I'm here today with carol renoff who is with development trust they're our community arm and we're also here today to talk about the rates remission as you've said madam mayor and councillors you've heard a little bit about this but I want you to tell you a little bit about our story I believe that this will have a huge impact um negatively on not-for-profit organizations um such as rickett and baptist church and others you've heard of as we use our buildings for a community hub in the ricketton area there's nothing quite like it we have a number of organizations who actually use our facilities all the way from the christchurch zongwa chinese society the tamil society korean cultural choir we also have tewananga who use our facilities for digital literacy and then oak development facilities at no cost because we're really passionate about what's happening in the community and to support what is going on we have a number as statistics have just come out recently from the council we have a number of migrants who are in the area and so we have a lot of different cultures that we represent and we also have a number of lower socio-economic people as well such as students who come along to a lot of our activities so um the community hub that we actually really believe brings people together helps increasing participation and community programs as well as enhancing basic life skills and these are things like even teaching sewing and cooking classes etc and we believe that this rates remission is going to actually have a negative impact on us to be able to provide these programs because of the fact we at the moment charge either zero or very little to these groups who use our facilities and so the cost involved so we really want to ask that you consider that the criteria for the rates remission be reviewed the social health and well-being aspects for the community and that's something which will not only impact us as you've heard today but also impact a number of other organizations not for profit etc um so yeah um we're just very um much wanting to get our point across that there's a lot of good and hope that we are building in the community and this will be impacted by uh the proposed long-term plan uh with the change to this particular remission for rates thank you thank you do um councillors have any questions uh sarah thank you um just we can fully understand what um cash reserves may be tagged to so sometimes they're tagged to you know you've had a grant then it's for wages coming up those kind of things what other things are sometimes these cash the cash that's in the accounts um sitting there waiting to be used for so we don't have a lot of cash often so that's to put it really honestly um and we may still come under the criterion is held there for reserves so sometimes we do have an amount in there because we need to pay for a large bill that's coming up or we may need to actually have money available to help with some of the programs coming up um and repairs a whole range of things power just the basics of being able to actually really facilitate the buildings that we have so yeah anyone else no jimmy I mentioned earlier the in your public church quite a few uh community one of our students and also the multi athlete group that is free free of charge that's correct yeah so um a lot of the events and all activities that we have we have no charge for whatsoever for those uh our oak development trusts run a number of those as well at no charge as well and we don't charge oak development trust and some of the organizations that come in some we charge a small amount but we're aware that they have their own costs to actually cover as well and we really want to be that come to okay but regular maintenance is your responsibility thank you maintenance that is correct yes okay thank you thank you and um thank you very much for coming in and making the submission thank you and katrina hill anger
One is tony walter from grace manila church kia ora thanks for the opportunity to speak today I just wanted to highlight a couple of brief points in relation to the proposed change for criteria for the rates remission uh by nature not for don't exist for their own benefit uh and but rather for the benefit of the communities that they serve so getting enough funding and donations is actually uh a real challenge to survive and any nfp that wants to run in a sustainable way must have cash reserves to survive so the the proposed criteria with the means test of 50 times the rate of value in my view is penalizing those practicing good stewardship so an example would be we have a building that has a annual rates of sixteen hundred dollars so if we have a closing cash balance of eighty thousand dollars uh or more that would make us ineligible for rates remission the intent I think of section 8 of the local government rating act as I understand it is to support the community benefit that not not-for-profits provide so I _-RRB-_95.439 cash reserves in order to survive and we would ask therefore that the current criteria remains unchanged for rating great submission yeah counselors any questions we've had a number of submissions on the subject so um I think people are generally clear-cut about what their issues are so thank you very much for the opportunity thank you
Uh adrian georgine on behalf of capcas films yoram welcome thank you so much um I am a content creator based here in christchurch and I own two companies a video production company called cat house films and a marketing collaborative called get marketing um I immigrated here in 2004 on a film and tv visa and with a view to working in film here um came from hollywood where I did development at abandoned park which is quentin tarantino's film production company and I've worked in film related activities for the last 25 years so I'm a writer producer director and have created theater tv and short films here in zed um basically I'm here today because we're really excited about canterbury being the next sort of film hub besides auckland wellington I mean even dunedin and queenstown get a bit more play than we do so we're trying to really put our voice forward that we'd love to see more investment more infrastructure more focus on that in the long term plan um we feel that there's a lot a have a unique opportunity to encourage screen production in the region as well as to support local content creators to stay put instead of having to go elsewhere to make a living and there's no time like right now with um covet basically we're on the world stage people are looking at us coming here to film and that's quite a unique opportunity um we also feel that we have the we have the space the talent the locations um an international airport and a new city that needs to be showcased so we feel like we've got the goods um I've my company was asked to do some market research for screen canterbury and zed by christchurch and zed we interviewed people like steve barr from tv and zed philippa mossman catherine bates and chris payne from the new zealand film commission jeanette volterno who's an american film producer and amy mckayman who is the ceo and producer of augusto um basically we got in touch with them and did research around their views of filming in canterbury and there were two things pathways to building um the screen industry in canterbury one obviously would be attracting production here the other one is development of local talent and development of local content so that the content stays here so that they're working together to create a viable sustainable industry the two things that people had a consensus on were we need a regional incentive to bring productions here the second thing was some sort of content creative content development fund to support local content creators to upskill and to create content here basically in the screen industry it's worth 3.5 billion a year canterbury gets about 2.4 percent of that currently there's a target on the table to try and um reach five percent um in the next five years I believe is the target um so to double it the the really interesting point is that approximately up to 60 percent of film production money often goes into adjunct services so leaving 30 to 40 percent being spent on the actual film so that 60 percent goes into hospitality building services transportation which we which means an incredible bump a mid-sized episodic tv series 113 million annual spend 117 full-time equivalent full-time jobs 2.7 total gdp 2.4 million estimated spend on accommodation and food so we kind of feel like we're sitting on an economic civil silver bullet of sorts um so we just in conclusion want to say that as a member of the industry we feel it's important for christchurch to ensure that money is spent to develop the screen production sector um as it's a proven pathway to creating economic wins for the entire region so this is essentially in support of the um the christchurch nc's focus on developing the screen industry that's right yes it is and it's a real plug for um passing a regional incentive that would be awesome yeah good any questions nope thank you and thank you for what you do thank you so much jake did you you can I just wanted 58 seconds uh if you could be more specific about what you mean by regional incentive a regional incentive is basically um if somebody chooses to bring their production here um cities it's 250 000 because we don't have the infrastructure we don't have the sound stages we're working on those things sort of as a phase one phase two phase three sort of idea um so bringing some sort of financial incentive to bring obviously we need to have a cutoff point 50 million production or more perhaps but to bring them here instead of them going elsewhere we need some sort of incentive to get them to come thank you love it thank you very much thank you so much thank you
Uh viviana zanetti from the phillipstown community centre charitable trust hello again I'm here today with marie byrne who is a member of our of the trust the trust submitted on a number of topics but apologies we forgot to submit our concerns about the cut to the strengthening community fund so I would like to join our voice to the one we heard that's fine there's plenty yet been making the same point so thank you we'll note that as an additional point from you thank you um so we submitted on different topics but we I will focus just on some of them first of all community facilities the trust supports the proposal of keeping investing on existing and new facilities but we also ask the council to commit to support non-council-owned_._61.96 facilities in this regard given the temporary tenure of our lee's agreement and the uncertainty associated to this we asked the council to actively be involved and work in partnership with the trust in developing a business plan for a replacement upgraded facility permanent hub in phillipstown the community facility network the network of the community facilities in town but this conclusion is based on the current provision of services from the hub true the feasibility study that the trust commission in 2020 shows that the philippine hub is the only facility providing community spaces and services in the phillipstown charleston area and there is no duplication of services if the hub disappeared tomorrow the gap that we'll leave will be sorry will be huge and given the number of groups and organization using weekly the hub and this is our weekly uh schedule and it's not even completed so yeah the the loss of the hub will be huge in that area parks weak as closing neighbors so the trust strongly supports at the current lancaster park redevelopment redevelopment plan and the funding are located in the long term plan however the trust is concerned for the time frame our light outlined in the plan as the most of the budget is allocated in the years 2024 2027 and we do not really support this kia ora I'm here in my capacity as a private citizen and one of the parts of volunteer work that I do in the local community is a trust board member of the phillipstown community centre charitable trust and one of our trusts objectives is to improve the welfare and um the well-being of the people of our local communities so the uh facility the the hub facility is really important to that there's no other bumping place in our community but also what I'm going to be talking about as a concern as a resident at the for the cut and deferment to the um fury road master plan and particularly the aldwin's two fitzgerald have part of that plan I drove down ferry road last night and the other parts looked good looked really exciting between barbados and fitzgerald lovely planter boxes and nicely colourful painted roadway and then over fitzgerald ave with the cycleway there looked really neat further down wilston getting quite excited about the work that will be done there and what it looks like however when we look at between aldwin's road and wilson's road it's a totally different story see that cars and pedestrians share the footpath the footpath is not coping it's the curbing and channeling is not coping with that sharing it's breaking away it's it's all over the place and when it rains the water pulls for several months I had like limited mobility and had to try and get around the neighborhood with mobility aids and it was nearly impossible and it wasn't just down ferry road but it's the whole part of phillipstown where the roading the footpaths are really at a horrible state this is an area that has high social deprivation either nine or ten and it's really hard to increase from the trust's point of view um involvement and empowerment in the local community of our local residents when we've got a neighborhood that we're actually not terribly proud to live in I actually love living in phillipstown and it's it's quite disappointing in a way that have to battle to get around the streets of phillipstown so that's my end it's just um perfect timing um for you know for coming together so that we've got a resident's perspective as well as the community hub I was there very recently and um it's just such an excellent excellent facility it's um yeah I hope that we can um work together as you suggest uh on on getting a secure secure tenure would be the the ideal outcome because it's such an amazing location so thank you very much for coming along thank you uh adrian georgine
Station about how that might might be developed so thank you very much thank you thank you james harris community development network I'm james I've been a hornby community youth worker for cdn trust for about 13 years uh we work throughout the city with young people running kids holiday camps for kids that are nominated by social workers teachers uh we run teen adventure camps we have uh youth workers in schools and we have uh an after-school youth hangout in hornby uh kyoto I'm caleb I live in holmby and um in five years time I'll be 19 and doing an apprenticeship kia ora I'm jackson I live in honduran in five years time I'll be 18 at uni studying to be an engineer we'd like to highlight two areas on the draft long-term plan the first one concerns waikola park the second is the proposed cut to community funding we told you how old we'll be in five years because in the draft plan wacola skatepark would not be restored for five years the skatepark is extremely old and used anymore the money ear marked in the draft long term plan is currently only half of what it costs to build the knight's stream skate park in horsewood we actually had two meetings of people like these guys and families who use waikola park a lot we unanimously received the same messages from everybody that came to those meetings the park is worn out and because of it is now boring unsafe and not child and family friendly the feedback came from 40 different students like us and families and what everyone wants to park once at the park pump track a better playground that doesn't hurt when you play on it and to renovate the skatepark add them and make it like hazel domain or nightstream and water fountains rubbish bin and also need some cameras and lights to make it safer wacola park is no longer safe and has become so run down that no one wants to play there anymore kids who use used to play tag on the playground don't use the playground at all now because the slide hurts your bomb sports clubs and families are getting involved to make wacola a great place again we are all going to contribute a lot but there is a lot we are asking for we are asking that you consider bringing this project forward and increasing the funds being made available so that this can become a well-used skate park by whole families again the skate park will be a cornerstone of our park in the middle of our community thanks guys uh second area I just want to highlight the 22 percent cut to community funding through strengthening communities uh this is absolutely foundational funding to groups like us we make great use and we're not unique in this we make great use of the funding that's given we estimate very conservatively that for every dollar of funding that we receive and use on programs there's at least another 60 cents of what we don't have to spend that's given by volunteers gifts in kind that sort of thing so we make great use of that the problem is that that one dollar is absolutely vital to two staff that's all we can afford the rest are volunteers 30 volunteers uh but we have to have those two staff if we lose funding and cut one of those staff out that's a vital cut and the volunteers can't do their work either the draft plan currently is for roughly 6.5 million dollars of strengthening communities funding annually this current year it was 7.4 and in the 2018 long-term plan the planned funding for 2022 was 8.3 million so the draft budget is a 22 cut on what was planned at that stage uh if that cut goes through uh it will be devastating to quite a number of groups and it will cut out a lot of the people who support the most vulnerable in our communities all right does anyone have a quick question uh tim here's the face of private investment with you know a sponsorship or rather from companies and local companies in the areas and has that come lifted up or changed at all uh what we've found we I came into my role as manager about five found that they're already supporting as much as they can what we've done is we've turned that around we started a social enterprise called upstream and zed feel free to look into it it's going really well uh it's booming and that's working alongside companies uh basically creating a win-win so that's working really well what we've really struggled is to get any uh investment in that social enterprise but that's the way we're working with businesses thank you thank you look thank you very much and I'd like to say thank you to the the two younger people who've come along um and I think using the age that you're going to be in five years time that very powerful way of making a strong message so thank you for that thank you for your time
Now is it julian bowden and tony smell you coming together is that have I got that right yes yes so we've got football and rugby side by side thank you um thanks for allowing us to actually come in side by side we we're actually really excited that two two of the largest sports in the city have been able to sit alongside each other and look at what's best for the whole community moving forward so I'm julian I'm the ceo of mainland football and both of us will do a bit of a scene set but then talk through some of the stuff that's come out of our individual submissions um firstly mainland football as you know is responsible for delivery of football across the region and currently supports 21 clubs and 15 000 registered players who take part playing sport every weekend over the winter on top of this we provide programs across the city for kids to have a at have a go festival days and holiday programs our sport continues to gain in popularity the hosting of the players come to the game both male and female being a global gamer membership and playing base is diverse our various competition structures ensure we cater for our wider community a doubling of junior numbers which is four or eight year olds in the last two years is cause for celebration but looking forward will provide challenges we've gone from just over a thousand kids aged four to eight playing in 2019 to over 2 200 this year and so that's well beyond any projection um that we had we need a strong focus sorry we have a strong focus on developing our club capability to deliver programs in communities the club licensing program is helping improve the experience for the player and for the family from canterbury rugby football union we're responsible for the delivery of rugby across the region and currently supporting 17 clubs in the city and also we have uh 15 000 registered players taking part so collectively between football and rugby we've got 30 000 participants playing the game every week so we're pretty passionate and important what we want've grown 68 to 83 teams so 25 increase in our teenage rugby space in the last three years probably contrary to what people think is happening in our sport our membership and playing base is also diverse various competition structures also ensure we cater for our wider community and a heavy and strong focus on developing club capability to deliver programs in our communities so the rest of this would really come together and we'll talk to you but the major issues that we see in in front of for both of us and probably all winter sports is a lack of quality plane and training surfaces two of the three seasons to the last three seasons has seen grounds presented in generally poor condition um lack of water via dry weather conditions or under performance of the irrigation system city-wide have equally had a role to play in this lack of training facilities with adequate lighting for teams to train mid-week and potentially development of midweek competition structures many of our teams and members that pay fees for two training sessions a week and a game at a number of our clubs are growing beyond the current um ground capacities that are within their region most obvious this is where we're seeing population growth in town um particularly over the horse wall way um and out in bishop dale case brook now that way as well um we also have a number of there are a number of health and safety concerns around player welfare with with the state of the the grounds that um that we that we're being presented but we're actually more interested in finding I guess solutions about how we move forward so collectively believe that a complete review of the green space field network for winter codes needs to be undertaken with support from the council and welcome being part of part of that review the need to investigate new technologies around artificial services as part of that plan noting that the need for water on these surfaces is non-existent and it's an issue that the council and the city face at the moment around water usage for the winter for the winter coats to collaborate around the schools and other sports to ensure a full community focus and access with an artificial turf we see as much as 10 times use on on a sports field than we do on a soil based field um the other opportunity that this will provide is for the council to actually retire some of the poorest performing grass fields there are parks in town that simply will never be repaired post earthquakes so the chance to retire those um and the other thing that's important to us is that the fields are strategically located around the city to give access to all um and in my in the documents that you would have seen there's some ideas in there around how that planning could take place but most most notably um close to schools um seems to be real value to us which we've seen at english park so the ask from us is is well we think it's reasonably simple but um mainland football and the canberra union is looking for support from the wreck and sports and parks team from the council to establish support and improve the current field network we'd like to work with council staff to establish business case proposals that would consider ongoing sustainability and community benefits this would include working along working around possible sites around the region and would maximize benefits to the wider community these may be current or greenfield sites we'll also appreciate assistance with developing a funding model looking to call on the resources of various entities to help establish the artificial network including councils uh council funders sponsors clubs and facility users so we're really here today I guess us recognizing that we've got um a challenge but it's a challenge we want to provide a solution to collectively and collaboratively and bring other people that are using the grass fields of the city and into the concept and we we do believe that you know when we sit down yes we're two different sports but actually we're there to provide opportunities for kids to go out and play and right now we believe that that's that's hampered but we believe we can find a a plan that'll see us move forward and allow more of our young people to get out and play sport yeah an artificial surface can can play rugby and uh football on at the same surface uh so we're pretty happy to be jointly trying to find solutions for it there's no artificial surfaces in the long term plan and that's uh that's a massive blind spot for what our research with the council with organisations in sport canterbury has identified as our need and we are pretty passionate about it and it's a massive blind spot not to be in the long-term plan it's financially uh beneficial to the to the council because we're retiring the grounds that need a heavy maintenance whether one can be used ten times ten times as much as the existing it's it's got financial benefits as well as the needs of the participants any questions can we know when the international sporting codes will accept them for oh so the quality of a of a service services capable of uh playing those international when will the codes allow it I think the most important thing though is we're actually talking about the community we're not talking about the elite level of sport um the council's made a massive commitment to an indoor um stadium that is the benefit of the elite this is actually about ensuring that communities can get out and play their sport at the weekend and ensuring that those fields or those facilities are located in places where use could be maximized so yeah there would be huge benefits though if the if the cannery multi-youth arena could have a an artificial feel yeah I get that yeah kyoto and thank you for the passion for um involvement in spirit I'm just interested to know uh what role the national bodies have in resourcing um fields local fields community fields that sort of thing yes I can I can speak from rugby they have no involvement in that that's seen at a local level for the for the union to work with the local councils and the providers to enable those to come into play committed to joint partnership arrangements to to make these things happen it's not about funding it's about trying to entice the council to have it in their thought process for a start and then for us to work with everybody to find the places to get these and they don't they're not necessarily easy because they're lights in a residential area that's the biggest blocker but um there's always a way clarified it's not about funding it's about how we work together with you and council together too we'd absolutely love some funding in the long term plan but we uh we would love for that if we're going to replace the work that needs to go on the parks because there's uh the financial savings let's let's have it as an option so there is money in the ltp for field maintenance and upgrades and new facilities our challenge is actually what let's not jump ahead to that solution tomorrow let's take a view of what that could look like over the next best way possible to get the best outcomes just going and throwing another grass field may not be the best best solution so that's what we're challenging is our collective thinking and we believe between the sports and our relationships with funders and with council we'll find ways to work together to help fund these facilities um we highly aware that funding is the hardest thing to get but um I think as tony said new zealand football unfortunately must have been talking to new zealand rugby they put no money into community field development either so it's left to the rugby union and ourselves to to work locally to find find solutions yeah well thank you very much and um it's uh yeah I mean you've asked us to put it on the on the radar and and I'm sure that now people are aware of it we'll have a good conversation about how that might might be developed so thank you very much thank you um james harris
Um irenka bribnall chairperson engelfield residents association welcome thank you right um so you've read our submission and um our main points are that good management stands on firm transparent foundations our christchurch city council is about responsibly spending our money on what is essential in this new covered world we have a bubble here but it is raging outside our borders we must be prepared to live within our means maybe for a few years before it will come anywhere near normal even before covert struck our communities and infrastructures were struggling we're hearing daily reports about children going hungry and cold and homeless see we come from linwood the poor side of town and we can talk about this if you think it is still okay to increase rates in the face of such suffering then you must be living in your cushy ivory towers and are totally disconnected to what is happening on the ground you have a responsibility to address these matters by cutting the fat on the council side and not increasing the economic pain and suffering on our lower socio-economic community it sea on the crisis city council trying to financially over plan a future for the people which is unsustainable with borrowings then there is then there is less need to increase our rates until the whole community is in a better financial position which will not happen if we keep scalping them now is the time to follow the government's lead and apply a wage freeze on all but the lowest paid council staff our concerns we also have concerns where we see the council making cuts to local services like the mobile library which is essential to keep our aging ailing economically challenged community connected mental health is just as important to our community is financial we wonder if there is also a mistake in the sums here as in with the foranui pool fiasco debacle what do you call it when there's a five million dollar mistake in the calculations from invisible council staff apparently it's only going to cost 2 million not 7 million it took the humble volunteer swimming coach not the overpaid council accountant to figure that out I'm sorry to I care about you all but I think we need to really get you know tighter with everything more vigilant how many more mistakes are made like this we wonder no wonder we have budget blowouts like the cycleway that promised much but delivered little the ombudsman report into the submission process with information being left out rigging of reports and stalling behaviours boarded on corruption yet the public were not given all the information and names were withheld this behaviour needs to stop without the basic foundations of truth honesty and transparency we will struggle to go forward people will become discouraged with the council council policy is all about walking and biking which means it is virtually important it is vitally sorry important to keep the local shops and facilities going what happened to linwood village borders on gross negligence as the council did not listen to the business people there to keep worcester street open at fitzgerald avenue the area was struggling but that surely was the nail in the coffin as we have had the supermarket and the subway closed since then well-established businesses closed since open shops there have been many plans and ideas since then but all talk and very little real action and no real accountability for the demise of this and many other local shopping centres which are having parking and access taken away for cycleways in the latest correspondence you say you're phasing out checks how the older people who still use checks going to pay what is your plan from them apart from coming in with loads of cash the other way is where they must engage with the third person to assist with the internet where there is the danger that other people will start having access to their bank accounts and then people are vulnerable to being robbed in an electronic way as we see regularly in the news finally it would be good to see more pushback from local government against central government especially on dictation of expenditure and putting fluoride in our water bring back female only toilets please we re-emphasize we need enough privacy this new age sort of you know where we all share the toilet I don't like it and a _''_304.56 retaining heritage more money is needed here less on parks and leave the red zone alone just some seats and tables keep the lawns motors enough for now thank you for this opportunity to share our feedback with you we hope you will listen to the voice of the people thank you and don't take any of what I said personally no no we're not but um thank you very much for your submission and perfect timing again so thank you very much thank you thank you now is it julian bad
Uh the um sorry the next the next one is logan keys uh curse reach flat water sports um so I'm here with stu clark as well who's a representative from arawa canoe club which is part of a group as well so just a reminder this is uh regarding our proposed cutting at ku's reach which this is the third time I'm discussing this in this chamber today and a reminder that we funded and completed a feasibility study uh last year which deemed the project to be feasible less costly than alternatives previously discussed and provided by other parties with opportunity for environmental enhancement and with alignment to the regeneration plan so congestion and overcrowding at kurs reach has been an issue even prior to the christchurch earthquakes it's not a new issue but one that remains unsolved there is now an opportunity within the red zone to provide a fit for purpose flat water space to alleviate historical safety concerns and meet the needs of all the codes the river and water space for our sports is the equivalent to what rugby codes and we currently cater for over two and half thousand competitive and recreational members within our sports our codes are bursting at the seams with demand far outweighing capacity essentially we need more fields we need more space and the river is our sports field the sports clubs still occupy sheds which are put up as temporary solutions post earthquake the leases on these sheds or the land they sit on is due to expire very soon the codes have withheld investment of insurance money in the area simply because we don't really know what's what's happening or what the long-term vision for the space we can only invest our money once and we need to ensure it goes into the right place and that is obviously to set up permanent and welcoming home for our sports at curse reach the proposed project project is too large simply for the sports to lead and while we are willing and able to partner with council when raising funds commitment and investment from the council is required to legitimise the project and open up other funding sources as raise funds for our permanent club buildings and facilities that will be geared around providing social and community spaces of which we're currently lacking currently lacking as part of our submission in year one we were requesting from council to commit to taking the project to a consent stage which we anticipate would cost between 300 and 350 000 with that we were looking for extension of our current leases to provide some security of tenure and to allow us to further investigate the preferred location of uh sports clubs at the current site kur's reach beyond year one we were seeking provisions for the construction of the new flat water facility the details of which are on our full submission between all the existing users we've formed a cross code group and we're auxing the trees on on the ridden submission that you've received and we are excited to work with council to deliver these improvements to the avon otakura river to enhance the safety of the river the usability and activity along the river as well as enable us to start investing in at the same time we believe we can deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes so if there's any questions on our proposal or submission happy to take it thank you are there any questions from councillors I think councillors are generally familiar with um yani so I was just trying to understand how how much money is currently on budget for this project in the ltp yeah nothing specifically but it's broadly we were looking to tag from the red zone funds essentially so have you been told if any of that money is able to be used or it's for other projects it's highly it's not it's not specific to any any one project as far as I'm aware from my discussion with staff um and that you know they'll respond to this whether that's an appropriate use of funds or not yeah and you're asking for us to make sure that some of that is tagged towards us exactly yep yep that seems pretty clear and the total just to be clear the total is about 20 to two stages to the project uh or potential stages which is sort of half that each time okay thanks good well thank you very much for making the time to come in and present in person it does help the you know focus on the issue so thank you very much
Good thank you um sam newton from recreational terror welcome mutant the new zealand recreation association trading as recreation arturo is registered charity and the organisation responsible for providing leadership advocacy and professional development opportunities for those involved in the broader recreation sector we're a professional association our membership includes recreation policymakers territorial local authorities voluntary organizations regional sports trusts outdoor recreation providers and others sport and active recreation contributes 4.9 billion dollars to gdp or 2.3 percent nationally and employs more than 53 000 new zealanders 84 of new zealanders believe sport and recreation bring people together and create a sense of belonging 74 of new zealanders agree that sport and physical activity help build vibrant and stimulating communities truly something christchurch city council is incredibly interested in we acknowledge and thank christchurch city council as the major provider of our city's play and active active recreation facilities the council has a critical part to play in ensuring people continue to enjoy a recreation opportunities council planning needs to adopt a long-term approach that considers factors such as urbanization population growth and an ageing population as well infrastructure is in place such as aquatic facilities and parks people are more likely to be active and enjoy all the numerous physical and mental health benefits they're in we support the investment of the christchurch city council when walking and cycling routes investment in active transport infrastructure achieves a dual benefit of easing traffic congestion and making it easier for residents to integrate healthy recreational activities into their day-to-day lives our view was that the ltp of 2018 had many good outcomes for the recreation sector uh specifically the depot tohito aquatic facility the development of the avon otakaro network and major advances in the realm of active transport we'd like to thank the city council for their contribution towards the canterbury spaces and polices plan that you did in partnership with sport canterbury and the adjacent councils that kind of plan reduces duplication and enhances recreational opportunities and ensuring efficiency of expenditure as well christchurch residents or canterbury residents are very active the active new zealand survey reveals that 75 percent of adults in this area undertake physical activity on a weekly basis however the same specifically on this ltp we do support the budgeted investment in large-scale facilities such as the aquatic facility in lynnwood the metro sports facility and the hornby multi-use facility we caution against predictable lag effect and participant uptake and those utilization of new recreational facilities and we urge you to be patient as people get used to those facilities being available a build it and they will come approach is not no longer appropriate in the new zealand recreation sector simply providing infrastructure is not enough recreational assets need to be activated and programmed to ensure that they are appealing we support submitted our support for takara avon river regeneration noting that fishing is the fifth most popular form of physical activity amongst new zealand adults and canoeing is enjoyed by eight percent of new zealand adults at least annually we submit our support for the major cycle routes and the local connections program we support the budget investment in parks and open spaces by christchurch city council specifically the botanic garden master plan and the regeneration work at hagley lancaster and qe2 parks however we are concerned that proposed to maintain parks at a fit for purpose level we encourage you to take undertake playability benchmarking for its parks for your parks and pay particular heat to the detail of park maintenance contract specifications we submit our support for the budget investment in play by active art by christchurch city council council and its destination and neighborhood play spaces it's essential that a investment and play infrastructure is applied to the growing population and new urban developments and under active demographics we note that a co-design co-paper for player infrastructure is often the most successful finally we'd like to encourage you to be wary of a recreational workforce shortage and capability gap some of that's about the earthquake 10 years ago but it has has continued there has been a recruitment and retention issue around recreational workforce and we encourage you to be aware of that spot on thank you very much that's done very well very well time thank you the um
2021 to 2031 and I'd like to invite um is it michael stronach from the christchurch polo club you can bring other people up to the table with you you don't have to come up alone if you don't want to it's fine thank you uh hi I'm charlie wood I'm the club captain of christchurch pollock club I'm going to speak on behalf of michael um so and I've also just brought some other members of the club here today just uh so you can uh if you have any questions for them as well after um what I've said uh so just a bit about our club uh we were actually established in 1890 um last year we were the largest polo club in new zealand uh this season we were just uh narrowly taken over by auckland polo club but we're doing pretty well for a membership um our focus is to maintain a club for players of all ages and abilities so they can enjoy the game locally and compete further afield we're strongly affiliated which means our club is supportive of new and junior players coming into the game currently our ground that we're playing on is out in wigram which beside the canterbury amp park uh it's been a great location for us for quite a few years um we've spent quite a lot of money on this ground um to establish the field to be a an international standard of play playing field and we've also put um quite a lot into the to the um ground as far as the the grass is and everything and the trees around there are well established that create really good uh shelter for us now originally when we moved to this ground uh in the early 2000s we were quite motivated to go over there for the prospect of we having two grounds possibly and this was gonna really set us aside from other clubs being able to host more tournaments however the new motorway development and when punaway sports hub was put in there it was deemed not possible to have two grounds so we've been limited by it makes an ideal overflow space for larger sporting events and such as the touch nationals which was held quite recently and that was the masters in the open division there next year they're going to host the junior nationals there and these tournaments I'm told have the highest participation numbers of any sport in new zealand in this tournament so we're currently required also to give up the use of this ground once a year over show weekend by the canterbury amp association for use of their car parking during the show and we always used to use that date as one of our key tournaments so we have to move that ground out to a practice field and rang yora for that tournament now so with all these things taking into consideration we find that a new ground and venue for christchurch to play would be really beneficial to all involved we have spoken with people involved with narpunaway sports hub and as a whole they're in support of our long-term plan to relocate the move would be favorable to the growth of the future of christchurch polo club um and we think that benefits both sporting communities so our proposal to eventually move the club base uh would be over to the land that the council owns at the urua domain and this is an exciting idea for us we believe it's important to keep our club base in christchurch itself a lot of polo clubs end up having to move further outside of the cities where they're based just due to land availability but I think it's really important that we keep within our city this place has already got a small hall and toilets and irrigation which is really helpful when putting an apollo field the space would have potential for two grounds eventually which would allow us to host major tournaments uh such as the savile cup which is the national club championships so that tournament was held earlier this year I can see I'm running out of time I'm going to go quicker it was held earlier this year but it's only possible at the moment in the south island from help from that as a club that would be great we've also got junior schools tournaments coming up in november and we're trying to host teams from australia and christchurch pilot club have always been uh really keen to help out and give their grounds for those which which helps the junior part of the sport so if if this goes ahead uh the new grounds would also be able to be used for other winter sports over the winter from may to october so if there were other sports that needed to use it so yeah we look forward to working with the council and to develop our sport and in that particular place if this was allowed to go ahead well that's a perfect timed um that was excellent that was excellent just one question quickly though did you talk to staff about the aureo uh location at all uh I haven't_''_339.84 been involved in that part might yeah I have been involved so can you repeat that please just just have have you raised it with staff yes and they suggested that you raise it thank you thank you very much for the presentation thank you
Uh jennifer joel oh sorry no names she's just on screen too oh jill nuttall I know jonathan hello jill in a city west neighbourhood association thank you very much for the opportunity um we are the inner city west neighborhood association icon a community residence organization formed in the 1980s for the area bounded by bailey avenue to cambridge terrace and on the west by hagley park and botanical gardens on the east by durham street our members are all dedicated to making christchurch central city a great place to live our submission concentrates on our area although many of the recommendations apply more widely our first point which underlies the rest the long-term plan needs to add critical actions to build a livable central city adapted to climate change not merely to mitigate its effects the city council should be adopting new methods of building transport materials and all these other things to become a low-carbon city therefore a strengthened climate action program must be threaded through the long-term plan it's not enough to have it separate each of the next steps must include implementation measures's not enough our comments on operational and funding matters if you were to match and advance the community outcomes that you adopted in christchurch city's strategic plan the long-term plan should strengthen compliance to ensure council sticks to its own rules the budget needs to allow for enough skilled planning staff with sufficient powers to ensure against commercial creep into residential areas in the central city this is an ongoing problem for neighborhood groups especially in the central city and if christchurch city council is to attain its own goal of bringing 20 000 long-term residents into the central city you must better monitor compliance enforce zoning and notify rma applications that break the rules we agree with the proposed rates increase and suggest that monitoring any future changes to short-term unhosted accommodation will require the appointment of dedicated staff if that's to be effective but if approved the increased comm rates for these commercial businesses could meet any increase in council cost to administer and leave some for other related services we agree with charging households a targeted rate for water usage it seems plenty for support the most effective and efficient public transport that can be designed and installed as soon as possible even though most responsibility risks with ecan the city council should include joint plans and implementation in the long term plan as every well-functioning city is built around its public transport system not apart from or long after most housing has been built meanwhile please bring back something similar to the yellow bus in the central city especially for those of us who can't walk far or that or like me are just not safe on cycles scooters or skateboards icon opposes cutting of the budget for the restoration of heritage buildings and recommends restoring heritage grants and heritage incentive funds to the previous seven hundred thousand and under this we support the plan to provide the arts centre with capital grant through a targeted rate and we support the plan to pay for the base isolation of the museum but we oppose the plan to dispose of five worcester street and urge the council to retain it in council ownership we have heard of businesses and charities who could use urge you to expand your search as you can see our submission offers support for the draft's modest move to mitigate climate change and offers ways the council can strengthen its repo response we owe it to our young people to act now and make substantial change well within the next 10 years thank you thank you well with 13 seconds to go and I've already admitted that I'm a member of icon so I can't technically ask you any questions um no it's same with um same with jake so thank you very much for your submission it's obviously a lot of thought and work has gone on to it so much appreciated thank you right that brings
Welcome good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to present to you today you will note that the submission is relatively brief items one and three which are before you are familiar as we have presented these before as to item three and completion of the route we wish to acknowledge the work of the council in undertaking an independent environmental impact report by buffamus school to determine a preferred route through the estuary the major sticking point this work is proceeding and we hope for a positive outcome quite soon furthermore we wish to acknowledge the input of the coastal area head ranger rodney chambers who performs an effective liaison role his advice and experience is much appreciated by our committee but I want to focus my remarks on number two that is the development of an enhanced relationship with the council so that the 360 trail is sustainable going forward as it is we are a volunteer committee who has pioneered a unique urban walking track around christchurch our resources are limited our belief is that the trail ought to be developed into a world-class urban walking walkers recently completed another eight day journey as part of the council-sponsored walking festival anecdotal evidence from these and others compare it more than favorably with other well-known walking tracks around the world a quote from an eight-day walker evaluation is we were told that this would be a life-changing experience and certainly it was I can see all sorts of possibilities for this great new zealand walk and so can we you see okatahi christchurch should be up there on the internet as one of the 15 best urban hiking cities in the world the council can make this happen the basic route is more or less in place its development requires marketing expertise which christchurch new zealand could undertake as a tourist attraction it requires accommodation and transport information jobs will be created it needs administrative services what we would like to explore is the opportunity to work more closely with the council to turn this vision into a reality I'm happy to take questions thank you do we have any questions uh sam just a really quick one sorry I may have missed in the submission well well let me say that the council has already invested several thousands of dollars into this project and so we we don't have an ongoing funding commitment from the council but this is something that we would need to address and to look at but I think it would be fair to say that the council has made a huge investment already and it probably would like to capitalize on that investment by development okay so okay phil thank you very much the you're saying about the both of this school we're doing a report are you looking at moving the estuary edge one away from the estuary to a different no the estuary edge is our preferred route yes yes um and it's currently there is an options assessment being undertaken by the council and it is looking at two possible routes what one which is called the alternative route which runs alongside dyers road and the other is our preferred route which is through the estuary and it's worth noting also that as part of the eight day walk permission is gained from having spoken to the project engineer that other groups from time to time actually go through the estuary so we're not asking for something that's impossible we're asking for something that requires imagination commitment and a will to make it happen and that's what we are for we think you see this is a one-off opportunity to get it right and we want to get it right and we think that you as a council would want to get it right as well which is why we are advocating very strongly for the preferred route that runs parallel to the estuary okay and you're working very closely with the with the ranger that works in that environment he's fabulous yeah yes we we're just so happy with because it was a couple of annual plans ago that yeah you gave us this liaison person and it's made our work a whole lot better yeah good yeah thank you all right well we'll move on to them thank you this is the last submission before the lunch break so we
Joanna gould shirley center jordan welcome good afternoon our christchurch ancestors created a place for learning the original shirley primary school in 1915 which later was turned into the shirley community centre this building became part of our community's identity and our own memories until it was demolished in 2012. our suburbs have had a significant increase to our population due to new residential unfilling housing and social housing since the ccc district plan has been changed after the earthquakes but no new community facilities are on budget in the proposed ccc lt plan the council collects significant development contributions from our suburbs to recover the cost of providing future growth capacity for facilities such as swimming pools sports centres and libraries that need investing back into our community yesterday councillor chen asked our community board what impact a new centre would have on rates the impact should be cost neutral the sales proceeds of the potential disposal of council owned properties the four properties two at hills road and two at slater street could be invested in building a new centre at ten shirley road we have collected be presenting formally in the coming weeks we have a letter of support from poto williams our mp for christchurch east the residents in our community want this but it is also needed this location is a very visible historic landmark at the beginning of shirley road leaving it empty without a community centre is a constant reminder of what we have lost that we have been forgotten and we have no community legacy for the future generations and clearly not what our ancestors intended by leaving the original building for future generations us we are asking you to instruct staff to put a plan in place to deliver a new centre in this long-term plan term we need a multicultural civic facility not faith-based not captured by loud voices in the community something owned and managed by our council for all the communities connected to shirley road thank you for your time I'm happy to answer any questions thank you questions appalling yeah do you feel that um these are a rising energy in the community to support this centre yes I think in the past you know they dissipated and it sort of they went to different areas in the city and it kind of lost a bit of energy do you feel that's coming back yes it is through our petition we've talked to many of the residents and they just assumed that the community centre would be rebuilt as part of the rebuild after the earthquakes and so um we've formed a official group shirley road central which we've been um engaging with the community we have our first event on saturday for a skip day to bring people down to the site and start talking to them um face-to-face about um what we could actually achieve on the site excellent excellent and you came with an idea about the the library at the palms are you still entertaining that yes I think the focus should be moving the shirley library which is part of the palms car park and releasing that land so that it can be redeveloped and then putting the shirley library down at a central place with the bus stops four of our main bus routes go the current place at the palms so public transport is very important at the site and we have over 2500 school students and their families within five minutes of this site so there's no um library in the inners ward so will you be talking to people about whether they support removing the library from the palms as well that's the next step yes what's your feeling so far um a lot of people are supportive because they're sick of it being in the car park they want um a space set it has playgrounds and the dudley creek is behind it so it's a really nice um relaxing spot and it's right across the road from shirley primary and as I said the school kids would be within five minutes of it so it would be great for all of them to have after-school activities and holiday programs that they can't actually have at the shirley library because it's too small right okay thank you thank you thank you very much for your presentation and uh good luck for saturday thank
Uh hank funk manager from the high high broomfield community development and you'll tell me it's pronounced hey hey I'm sure welcome welcome thank you I've been a community worker in the high high broomfield area now for for just over 40 years and currently working for the um for the for the team at 126 on the corner we've got about 40 odd volunteers putting in about 7000 hours a year we've always appreciated the support we have from council both as individuals and as as a as a council as a whole it's it's been really good I guess I don't have any clever words to say to you guys you're the clever ones you can you're welcome to the job not a job I could do but I do have a great concern that you're just going too quick it sounds old but you're just going too fast you're spending your money too quickly see if I if I have to buy something or if I have to get something or do something it buy it job done I can't emphasize enough to pain your causing and I know you already you've probably heard this a thousand times before I'm sorry to make it a thousand and one but you know it's hard I know everybody wants to do everything today I do but it doesn't work like that either and I'm just just asking to slow down I'm not asking to stop doing anything I'm not complaining about the plan I'd like to see a really fleshed city too I like seeing new stuff go up and I like seeing changes and people having a go but the people at the bottom of the heap really genuinely struggle to keep up you're asking for a five percent increase and I know that my annual increment on my pension is significantly less than that so what you're asking me is to dig into my pocket further and further to pay for it and I struggle with that and I've had a good upbringing I've had a good life I've manage but I know there's a hell of a lot of people out there who don't there's a single mums and of which we have a large amount a large amount of beneficiary some a lot have been put out of work by covert some of that work's coming back I'm pleased to say but a lot of it isn't and when it is it tends to be more part-time type work which is great bit of nothing and yeah I just I just see people really struggle we we put it we put we've got a food shared thingy as part of our stuff and we put through probably a ton and a half of food a week roughly and it just isn't enough it's not because people are relying on it it's because there ain't anything else to eat we see kids coming past asking us if they if we've got any buns or bananas we get a few few by the way but you're asking those people and even if they're renting the's going to go up sure is x for a whole bunch of reasons but you're one of them and you have a level of control and the problem with rates increases are that they're continuous and they keep on coming back you know that bill keeps on arriving it's not just a one-off issue it's a lifetime statement that you're making for my society and I just I just have a heartfelt plea for you guys to take them into consideration and I know it's hard and I know yeah it really can't_''_294.56 be done but I ask you to slow down simply because some of us can't afford to keep up with you guys I'm sorry we just can't_''_306.8 do it and yeah that's all I've got to say thank you that's a very powerful submission we really appreciate you coming and making it in person and speaking on behalf of others thank you thank you
Okay thank you daniel haye community committee member hoon hey community association I'm here with jenny goodman the chair of uh committee um I'm here to talk about a number of issues which uh the hune community have brought to us um mainly around the inclusiveness of our community um one of the uh issues facing our area is that uh with the new houses being built in halls wall hunhay road has become a main thoroughfare for the area and traffic has increased in the morning and evenings one of the things that our community has identified as a need is a new pedestrian refuge on hunhay road just off lewis street at the moment this is an area with a lot of shops and elderly residents and our residents with uh less ability are having a struggle to get across the road another issue around this is a lack of appropriate shaded seating in parks in the area which again is an issue for older persons and people with differing ability um the major issue that I want to talk about today is the retention of for us and I really want to thank you for all the work you've done around um supporting us um and the the hune community centre formerly the um children's library um has a lot of potential as a facility um we already in the past uh seven months have done a number of events uh for halloween we've done uh two christmas events we've done two easter events we had a residence meeting not that long ago and we have more plans in the future but more improvements are needed on that carolyn potter when she came here yesterday she suggested the idea of selling centennial hall and using the funds for that for our improvements some of the improvements are around accessibility as well at the moment uh entranceway is uh not at a stage where wheelchair users could uh comfortably get in um so too our bathrooms really are not accessible for wheelchair users at all um there are also um we also are working on getting wi-fi in our center as well and um are looking at um what are the issues providing storage facilities and installing a kitchenette as well as a big kind of goal in the future so um because also we have a lot of locals using that we have an after school group every day after school and we also have a lot of parties being held that we really want this to be used as a secular space uh in the community because those are few and far between um and with the issues facing our city strengthening communities um is really I think a big goal for all of us um I know I would also say as well um one of the issues was that for a long time we were under the impression and it was originally the community center was on the council's disposal list a feasibility report was done to talk about the potential for the building and we thought we weren't going to have to do a lot of work to try and convince council for the retention of the building however recently incidentally when we invited someone from the building department to one of our meetings we _''_215.2 but we're still it wasn't really confirmed it was sort of just I think it's uh I don't think it's on the disposal she said to us um and really I think that really highlights um as was said in the uh the last submission around a need for more communication between council and residence associations and communities in general um I think that's something that the council and us and the community can really agree on thank you very much you may ask a question you recommend the uh hong hay park in the springtime domain uh to be installed a shared city shield one yeah what kind of shady one um one of the things that I was identified as around well which is also something carolyn potter talked about yesterday was more planting of native trees yes um which would be great for shading but then also around um some um you know just coverings for those seating as well um and or the other thing I mean to say as well is that the the facilities the bathroom facilities and either that's another thing around accessibility um and one of the things with hoonai park is it's fully utilized at weekends for sports facilities there's one seat inside between the area of fusilier street and tankerville road there is one seat in that park and we find we reckon that picnic tables would be fully utilized for people having picnics and also for people attending sports functions at the weekends okay thank you thank you very much for your submission phil thank you much appreciate it right um
Okay thank you um jolene edgar chippes and templeton residents association thank you so thank you for the opportunity to quickly highlight one area in templeton that we would love to see included in the long term plan an upgrade to the templeton domain playground and toilets the equipment is very old and if we don't start to plan for an upgrade within the next 10 years it will become dangerous and unusable it does not have another 10 years life left in it I would like you to consider the templeton community and the use of the playground being an isolated suburb our domains are hubs for social interaction we have a wide age group to cater for templeton and our primary school have started great initiatives with a localized curriculum and reach integrated learning they've just installed two basketball hoops on the school grounds that they are making available for the community to use the feedback has been positive with the kids having good clean fun the school have started with native landscaping and community gardens so with the school across the road from the domain supplement each other becoming a community space with even more food traffic the school is keen to get involved with planting waste management and murals at this domain and the tra is committed to help improve templeton as a better place to live and would like to partner with the city council and the primary school to do this together the skateboard is great and being utilized well there is a definite opportunity here to beat the use the rest of the space available and to be creative with thoughtful landscaping and fun equipment to create something special our kids want a place to hang and things to do so we have an opportunity to provide them with a safe space the tra together with the school would like to be involved with this and the tra is keen to help find additional funding to assist the council should you see the benefit of this upgrade like the rest of the templeton community does to end I'm going to borrow a phrase from one used by the deputy principal of templeton primary school if you build it they will a theme from a number of the residence associations about wanting to work in partnership with the council and then also looking to broader partnerships that might bring in additional funding and I think it's a it's a theme that's been very well received around the table so thank you very much for your submission
Thank you thank you our shireen and francis helps flee bay farm ah thank you um do you really think rating the life out of the rural community will save christchurch from flooding uh we just see this is another stick to beat us with and never is there a carrot in sight to reward landowners who have done their best to protect biodiversity including freshwater species is the rift so great between rural and urban that you are this out of touch do you really think farmers are making so much money you can snatch so much off them do you not know we are suffering one of the worst prolonged dry spells in living memory farmers are having to sell capital stock and buy and feed at inflated rates just to try and keep some of the genetics they've spent years of breeding do you not comprehend the stress farmers are living through at present do you not understand farmers have one of the highest suicide rates of any profession at buhari we've achieved much we have two of the cleanest waterways in canterbury with the with covenanted native forest and native forest strip nutrient sinks across our hillsides and surveys of our streams testify to our success we have dropped stock numbers by at least 50 percent and done everything in our power to save our environment and natural biodiversity and create a zero emission farming operation we protect the largest mainland colony of little penguin on mainland new zealand out of our own pockets and what have ccc done to help you have taken away accurize and bank expenditures prosperity by not only taking away the cruise ship business but falsifying a report stating aguero was the least favored destination when the opposite was true therefore trod destroying achara's great reputation as a tourist attraction to sabotage acheron banks financial as tourism in such an underhanded way was staggeringly unbelievable and hurtful just to make sure this tactic works you hike up the charges to discourage what cruise ships might want to keep coming you are trying to force banks peninsula farmers to go for a resource consent for any farm improvements or management of of improved pasture this particularly disadvantages farmers like basis because we have chosen to preserve so much of our native forest the more you preserve the more you need to control to keep your farming at a reliable balance of viable balance it's seriously disadvantageous as any farmer wishing to farm zero emissions regenerative farm you made deals of forests and birds as to the coastal plan this has horrifying implications for us it's contracted your contracted engineering firm has spent millions on resurfacing banks peninsula shingle roads the failure to control rainfall runoff in the design of shingle roads has meant that much of this road services newly laid down is quickly eroded away roads should have three sweeps with the grader first to clear the ditch second to sweep shingle from the outside edge and third to smooth down the center being careful not to flatten it to the extent the water will not run off the sides two sweeps just does not do the work necessary to stop road damage the lack of ccc roading oversight is no better demonstrated than gorse and the misty peaks reserve growing in the ditch to such scratching along the sides of passing vehicles culvert heads are blocked off by eroded shingle and plant material with the ccc roading contractor he's failing to clear even when a team is sent out with a digger to do so sorry sorry to interrupt but we've come to the end of the time would you be able to submit the balance of what you're reading from because you've covered it close to you've covered off a number of things that we're very behind time we've covered off a number of things that weren't in your original submission and I'd like to look into those okay thank you I'm jolene edgar person
Simon templeton from age concern thank you for the opportunity as everyone else it's actually probably quite fitting that I follow that previous conversation you'll know that it's in my submission which I'm not going to read to you my main role here today is really to encourage you to do better for older people and to have a greater focus in your minds when you are developing any change I see in the long term plan the acknowledgement at the front end that we have an ageing population but the devil will be in the detail and similar to the previous person you know we're not here to say specifically how to meet the needs of but my role is to make sure you you address and take into account the needs of older people we all know we have an aging population the population of your constituents in 30 years time a quarter of them will be over 65. that's well known what might be less known and I think more relevant is the population of over 80s is growing by 283 700 in our communities in the next 30 years so when I'm talking about the needs of older people you know my organization we're generally not uh coming into contact with the fit active 65 75 year old that's well connected with their community it is the older people that struggle the older old generally who are being locked out of their own communities and I know this council can't_``_112.0 do much about the stopping of checks and the closing of community banks and things but it really highlights the fact that we are putting barriers up for what are going to be your biggest growth in community so I would love to see at every decision you make around this table for whatever it is because you know older people are just people there are parts of the community just like everyone else but some of them have specific needs the other thing I draw your attention to and we are here to support is the disability communities um discussions with you so 59 of those over 65 have a disability so essentially a disability that age which most of you statistically will so we are services and things can be focused on that disability community you are also taking the box for those older people who are likely to struggle with whatever it is you are focusing on roads transport rates increases there are some specifics in my written proposal which you'll have read around advertising better the the rates postponement and things for older people it's a great option moving forward that 30 years one real concern for us is and you will again be aware of the drop in home ownership rates and so by the time you know I get to that age we'll be looking at about a 50 home ownership rate which means 50 of older people will be in rentals today if you are over 65 in a rental and reliant on superannuation only you are effectively below the poverty line it is a struggle so every increase the council puts which flows through to rent and other things as a burden on those people so I'd love to see a greater acknowledgement of a box you tick that everybody in these subgroups under you has to tick a box to say we have addressed the needs of the older person in the same way I know you have with the disability community which is fantastic that would be great thank you that's very clear-cut so thank you very much for your presentation pleasure
Um megan thompson activities manager burlington retirement village hi guys um my name is megan thompson I work at a newly developed retirement village out on preston's road uh we're part of a company called kestrel we also own a retirement village called alpine view which is uh three kilometers the other end of preston's road we are soon to open another village here in christchurch and I wanted to come and speak to you today about the proposed plan of cancelling the christchurch city library mobile van I wanted to come and discuss this with you because cancelling a service like this is going to cause huge damage to my residence in our village burlington village at this village it's a lifestyle village so we have residents over the age of 65 retiring here and many residents use this service on a weekly basis um the van comes on a friday for 30 minutes that's all we need and at this stage we have approximately 30 residents using this span weekly we've got 100 residents on site at the moment this is going that will be accessing this van um so my issue is with cancelling the service you're essentially cutting off an entire generation from using something they've always used their whole life books by removing the service um they aren't able to access something they should be entitled to access root books um a lot of our residents can't actually drive themselves into the library to get books there's a variety of reasons for this one their mobility they can't drive a car some of them many of them especially majority of our females actually don't have their licence so if a husband passes away they actually cannot drive a vehicle with comes that sight issues hearing issues and most importantly confidence issues I mean the city itself for someone my my age I love our city I think it's fantastic especially seeing it before the earthquake and now after the earthquake for a lot of residents it's unrecognizable they don't have the confidence to use gps on their phones um they can't use their car gps screens they're there us actually physically getting themselves into the city parking their car using a parking meter then going into the library and coming back out is just too difficult with the van coming like I said for just 30 minutes a week it allows those all of those residents to have access to a service that brings so much joy I truly believe it's a service that will cause more damage than good by cancelling it um they've been tax payers their whole lives they continue to pay rates and I truly do believe this is a service they deserve to have access to thank you thank you I mean we've had a lot of submissions on on the um mobile library and I guess that what what what has um sparked off this debate in the ltp is the the buses coming to the end of their lives is there is there are there other options you know in terms of other ways that the service could be delivered um not necessarily with a standard drop-off point um for I mean I'm just thinking one that long ago they don't get the sorry I was just communicating with siri by accident the um that they uh they don't have the mobile library come but the librarians do um take books there and change them regularly yeah so so there are other ways of providing the service absolutely and in our care centre so we have um three facilities on site we have our care centre our dementia center and then our independent livers and I look after the independent livers and I do know librarians do bring books to the care centre I mean if that's the way we want to move going forward as long as um I mean with the mobile mobile van it's completely independent um when wendy who ran it who was in it for a very long time who she got to know the residents and the books that they liked um and she knew that some residents liked big print and some like small and there was more fiction than non-fiction it was that personal touch um and for 90 of our residents when so they don't sit down at the end of the night and watch tv they pull out a book um I mean if moving forward that was an option as long as we could keep access to the books for the people who couldn't get to the library I think that's my main message so I'm also thinking that with technology and I accept that there may be disadvantages for some but there will be staff who would be able to help people choose the books that they wanted and the books could literally be delivered maybe from parkland's library would be closest library to where you are um you know rather than a central uh mobile service so are you talking about residents um ordering the books and then they're being delivered yeah okay yeah so I mean they could have a look at what what was on offer generally across our library service yeah and they could be delivered once a week or whatever so I mean all I'm saying is that are there are you open to the wider concept of delivery absolutely okay cool thank you very much thank you uh simon templeton from
Good afternoon team my name is anthony o'donnell and I'm the network delivery manager at orion new zealand limited thank you for the opportunity to comment on the council's draft long-term plan 2021-31 orion submission focused on ensuring that the long-term plan budgets have been appropriately allocated to manage trees and vegetation in accordance with council's tree policy and regulatory responsibilities as governed by the electricity hazard from tree regulations the electricity tree regulations primarily covers the maintenance and trimming of trees near overhead power lines and ensures public safety while also maintaining a secure and reliable electricity supply the council's tree policy was recently adopted in march 21 and provides guidance for planting protection maintenance and removal of trees on council-owned land within parks reserves roads and other public spaces orion also made a submission on this to achieve the ccc tree policy set objectives the long-term plan must ensure appropriate budgets have been allocated to deliver on the following pruning of trees to achieve the necessary clearances to infrastructure to regulatory requirements ensuring appropriate budgets are provided to remove trees if the risk the public or infrastructure and our important note that a new budget is to be established and allocated within the long term plan to address other options rather than cutting down the tree as this should be the last option an example of this is the installation of underground cables or providing an engineering solution to address the conflict this all requires funding of note recently orion and council have formed a working group to address trees that don't meet the requirements of the tree policy this team will work together to review assess and provide solutions for trees that don't meet the requirements contained within the tree policy however the success of this working group must ensure that appropriate budgets are allocated I'd like to thank stefan thomas ccc's operation manager transport and his team for their collaborative approach to this issue and delivering the best outcome for the city iran's submission also focused on collaboration while this won't specifically require any amendments to the long-term plan coordination of works has potential to impact on expenditure in this area orion like the council works program which is defined in our asset management plan I've left a copy I'll leave a copy here and for sustainability stake I just bought one so you guys can fight over it I'll just leave that here orion's proposed four works program sorry that will include the installation of several significant 66 kv cable projects requiring large trenches within road reserve this work will be invasive having an impact on traffic flow and the community in which the cables will traverse through due diligence of the first cable route is currently underway from sydnem to bromley with the delivery of works to begin in 2023 these are subject sub transmission cables that will supply between large zone substations coordination and collaboration with council is essential to increase efficiencies and reduce project conflicts or rework a coordinated planning approach on council on road reselling projects cycleways three water infrastructure upgrades is required so to avoid and or lessen the impact and the recently sealed roads or roading projects we have initiated early discussions with council on that and every proactive in their approach which is cable project is progressing well thanks again to the councillors who supported us following my pre-construction presentation to the respective community boards these are people-sensitive projects but are essential for our city growth and resilience in closing I look forward to your acceptance on the proposed amendments within our submission and look forward to delivering these significant projects we will look to serve the people of christchurch now and into the future thank you thank you for that um reading your submission was um quite an eye-opener you know because um you know our reflections um of the earthquake repair strategies didn't quite have the same joined up feel to it so yes I feel like that there's a learning that's been taken from that and uh or a lesson that's been taken from that and uh it's being implemented in a much more proactive way which it sounds good it does yes yep very promising it's good um 66 kb um underground cables I remember them well and you mentioned sydnem two um the same destination bromley so um that's and because community engaged management but I assume that that's all joined up with the council as well it is um so when we present to the community boards we also propose a comm strategy as part of that proposal for work so great so but I mean in terms of the timing of it um that that you you're working with the council engagement teams yeah around the engagement strategies exactly yeah nicole great excellent thank you all right thank you very much I'll just leave this it was a very interesting submission I don't want that yeah nothing personal
Um the next uh the next is stu edwards from fulton hogan thank you for this opportunity um mr chitick will be speaking on our behalf good morning uh good afternoon thank you for the opportunity uh for submission on the christchurch city council ltccp 2021-31 uh to summarise some of the points of our submission uh in the interest of time uh basically our submission relates to the inclusion uh of provisions within uh the ltcc ccp uh that not only supports funding to be allocated to biodiversity projects uh to give effect to your biodiversity strategy 2008-2035 but also the inclusion development of new biodiversity sites within the city so our primary focus is on ensuring sufficient financial resources are allocated and available for not only the maintenance of existing but also the establishment and extension of new sites within the city an example on point uh is fulton hogan is a landowner within christchurch city council uh to the south uh west has a location of prop a property of 25 hectares that is currently a quarry and is being extracted on robert's road and next door to a residential zone we have rehabilitation requirements with that site that would see it just return to dry land pasture we think there's opportunities in working in partnership and collaboration and the delivery of the christchurch city council biodiversity strategy and how that could actually be enhanced further and made as a public asset there is a residential land to the east of it that is zoned for our development and then it would create effectively a public community facility as it transitions into rural urban fringe yeah so we guess the point we want to make is that rather than go back to what is low productivity uh pasture we think there's opportunity to work uh in an opera an example like this but also elsewhere to go beyond what is the minimum standard and I guess the the last thing I'd point to would be that um that the commentary that's made within the strategy itself uh refers to a network of open spaces and recreation facilities that provides a diversity in the type and size of open spaces and recreation facilities wellbeing needs of the community continues to contribute to the earthquake recovery of christchurch and revitalise communities where people can enjoy a high quality of urban environment and enhanced opportunities for recreation most importantly it is accessible and distributed to meet demands generated by population growth urban intensification and areas of identified deficiency and it provides users with a pleasant and safe environment and it involves enables temporary and multifunctional uses and it recognizes and provides for the historic and contemporary relationship of naitahu with christchurch district's lands and water resources and reflects cultural values so I guess that um we can stop there but I guess that just coming back to the point is we think that provision for the funding and how it is allocated is not just for the maintenance of biodiversity but also for the enhancement of and creation of new biodiversity and recreational blends for christchurch residents to enjoy have you talked to council staff about about this proposal yes we have we've met with both christchurch city council biodiversity and recreation team as well as environment canterbury's team too and they and was it recommended that you make a submission to the ltp I mean it's very good I mean I haven't um heard the concept before but um and I have looked at some of the ex um usually when we're having someone at the end of the table telling us about quarries that isn't quite like this um but in terms of the in terms of um what I've seen it is a precisely the remediation that you've described which is low value pasture yes um land and uh and nothing of great significance in terms of community immunity so this this looks like something we need to investigate okay so we will so will thank you appreciate that appreciate the time thank you good
As mark gerard from the historic places trust councillors thank you for allowing us to make the submission just to begin with we'd like to acknowledge and thank the efforts of the council's heritage team led by brendan smythe we'd also like to acknowledge the efforts of richie moyle and the council's ongoing restoration of its heritage buildings and I think you'll agree the eben's band rotunda is looking fantastic especially at night I'd also like to in addition acknowledge the work of linda burns and the team who are currently working on the central city interpretation and cultural market program it looks very promising now moving on to this serious stuff the council's proposed heritage targeted right strike cannot be request the council's adopter proposed here just targeted right as outlined in the draft ltb for the following reasons we think it gives you an opportunity to really work on the future of the kennedy provincial council buildings gives you a number of options as outlined on our submission and effectively the money you're setting aside really is is municipal chambers we've already entered into a commercial relationship with box 112 honouring that relationship and bringing the building back into the public's eye as regards the rob mcdougall gallery well this has been closed since 2003 so he has an opportunity to open up what is a magnificent gift to the city the fact that it also is part of the museum kennedy museum development and if this goes ahead the funds occurred will enable the museum to proceed to central government for a quest for funding as well as enabling both both buildings to host world-class exhibitions we think this is great they are all iconic branded sites we also request that you adopt the recommended targeted rate based on house value as we consider this to be more equitable in addition the targeted rates especially for the arts centre we need to remind the councillors we support this one this is 255 million dollar world-class restoration project it's a small amount of the total that's been sent spent and we think it's crucially that it be pursued and fully restored it will and if and I should point out a fully open fully open site means more tenants and a higher rental yield and the central city will benefit again we request the recommended targeted raised on house values historic places canterbury would request that the council restore the heritage incentive grant to its previous level of seven hundred thousand dollars a year once the disbanded landmarks what's left the landmarks grants has been exhausted whilst we considered prudent you folded the remainder of the grants disbanded grants into we considered the amount of money set aside to last 10 years is unrealistic already with the grants being made it now appears there's a million dollars left and with no additional contributions this is expected to last 10 years this is unrealistic and we re at this rate we think it will be exhausted by the time by 2023 the next review will be 2024. we note the council has widened the heritage grant criteria to include non-scheduled items of heritage value including buildings movable heritage engraved monuments so in other words there will be a greater demand for this is obliged to honor its own inherited strategy you entered the committee asked the community the community said we value heritage and you respond to the heritage strategy withdrawing funding effectively you're withdrawing the partnership you made with the community the document refers to partnership you're now deciding you don't want to pursue this partnership we think you should continue with it the other addition is too is the huge the head the huge incentive grant is the character entice owners to list their buildings and therefore it's an important tool for the heritage incentive team we should remind you that heritage commercial restoration is a successful catalyst for local economic regeneration and we point out to them the difference this is made at high street and the duncan's buildings and mckenzie and willis it's mates it makes a real difference um we just note on our attached documentation that we've included there as an example in a study on virginia heritage visitors the heritage visitors stay visit twice as many places and spend twice as two and a half times more money is we've asked considering the potential disposal of council-owned properties we request that the councils withdraw this proposal and and the council set up a full meaningful community consultation for each property that is outside the draft long-term process our reasons for this are the council is proposing to use a commercial tender process for the building's futures we've been involved in this in the past you may recall to get to have a say in one building in the past we had to register in a commercial tender situation to have a say which to be honest I don't think the system was designed for that because it has secrecy etc etc that's for the community to have an input on decision making so I don't think it's appropriate the rolison house could be used for ngos if they're finding a use one building the sink we've singled out particularly is the old hurst memorial hall now this was fundraised as a government scheme it's a practical living monument to the falling available to serve the community and this be sold off you've got an obligation to community so I think you should involve a full community consultation before you put it on disposal list and work through the community as an example we're of course so fully support of the proposed intangible heritage grant fund and the other proposals sorry you've come to the end of the five minutes so I just I'm sorry about it thank you very much no thank you very much you've got a lot of detail in your submission and we have read them so thank
Anthony bright um christian city council public art advisory group thank you fiora tata thank you very much for the chance to talk to you today on our submission um first of all my name is anthony wright I'm the current chair of the group and I'm supported by deborah mccormick dame adrian stewart paul lonsdale and carolyn grant who are all associated with our committee you can see the membership up there including council staff so that we ensure that we are aligned with council's goals and objectives our particular goals and objectives are to champion encourage and commission public works of art for christchurch to administer the public art fund which has very little left in it which is why we're here we're practical to achieve one-to-one or better funding from other sources to augment the council grant and we'll be able to show you that we've done much better than that one-to-one over our first 10 years here's our vision it's about reigniting and reinventing the artistic legacy we want distinctive and innovative art and we want out or our visitors from elsewhere um we have some guiding principles in our first 10 years we were very focused about the four within the four avenues of the central city and also trying to get public out at the major entrances to christchurch or to be associated with major strategic developments as you'll hear in a minute in our second 10 years we want to complete that mahi but then expand to the suburbs and our other big principle is that the city funded public art will be a partnership with other public and private sources so we play an activity an advocacy role we consider applications for funding we host occasional functions to bring together people that might lead to public art in in our city and we provide advice to anyone that's contemplating uh putting up public art on their own um on their own endeavors and there are a couple of examples up there our results from our first 10 years we think are pretty stunning I don't expect you to read this because it's too detailed but we achieved our first's 2.1 million dollar investment over that 10 years was leveraged by fundraising that we um achieved of 6.75 million so that's additional funds raised from private and philanthropic services so in effect for your 2.1 million dollar grant we have delivered 9 million of public art assets all owned by the city now so we are requesting that our public art fund is reinstated it's got a 13 plus year trek record um we we were able to demonstrate that everything installed pre-earthquake has survived and stood proud so everything's been engineered very well after the briefest of drawing breath post earthquake we got back into delivering more public art and as I said before at the 10th anniversary we had achieved everything in our own 10-year plan which was a surprise to us I think because it was a pretty um stretch plan at the beginning so the city owns a pretty enviable collection of top-flight public art and we're going to take a quick fly through that now very quick so nucleus hopefully these are all very familiar to you uh flower power come back um julia morrison's tree houses for swamp dwellers uh one of this is one of the great ones of international uh solidarity after the earthquakes misha cabal solidarity grid and um here are a couple of the the lights out of the sequence here's the whole sequence of the grid and here's our mayor um with the mayor of um uh unveiling the kurashiki street lamp so part of this international thing was was having all our sister cities involved as well as other cities all around the world so a really international thing for christchurch to do chapman's homer sitting in front of the art gallery now was a very popular one that the public contributed to the largest public sculpture in new zealand fanfare out on the northern motorway lit by night and that's something we're increasingly doing is is lighting our works by night and nightly's stay in two locations a wonderful memorial to someone killed in the earthquakes standing in the king edwards barracks diminishing ascend nathan poglios raised the anchor in little hagley park and just of tapai so we are seeking uh input from council we'd like um to continue to be a leader in public art and we'd like to talk to you about where public art sits in council in terms of advocacy administration and maintenance in terms of maintenance we have got maintenance funding into the council budgets for all the existing work so there shouldn't be a an issue with those in in the future but the loss of our annual grant three or four years ago equals a loss in all of that industry and philanthropic support so we're requesting that you uh reinstate the public heart fund just a couple of closing comments from me here is that okay thank you day madrid stuart and I in 2007 are presented to this council and we have a 23-year history of public art which I think speaks to itself in terms of what we see around the city every day in our beautiful city so we would like to continue this partnership with the council through the public heart advisory group to make sure that we to find a better way to fund public art for every one dollar that the council puts in we bring through the partnership 4.5 dollars of return so we would like to continue to do that creative new zealand most recently have published some advice for arts organizations to submit into the ltp plans and we're absolutely delighted that we've been held up as exemplars for our work with waka ahine being held up as an example and also diminishing ascend so please do reinstate the fund we want to continue to bring our volunteer effort and all of our supporters um to continue the role in mahi to bring public out to our beautiful city thank you thank you very much thank you the next submission is mark gerard from
A reserves management committee jenny heavy um I'm sort of representing involved with two committees the reserves management committee as well as the residents association as I'm the chairperson of both so I did bring along a hat to try and um but I think I've dropped it on the way in um so I submitted on behalf of the reserves management committee obviously we have a huge stake in what's um the development of steadfast we have put in we've already put in considerable number of hours in the development we've planted 2 000 trees last year we've spent the whole summer with volunteers watering those plants so they get a good start and in in collaboration with the focal aura healthy harbour group we look at we are looking at that development going right up the riparian area and also developing other parts we have currently there is a development landscape plan that's out for submission so I did bring some along just in case you haven't been haven't got those to your fingertips um so perhaps if copy them off for everyone so basically um yes it's a it's not just the bottom bit that we're thinking about we're thinking about the greater reserve the most important thing to us is that it is gazetted because this piece of land has been um put out possibly as being displaced disposed off twice in the recent past I think the most recent time was 2018. so it's gazettel in terms of everything we do is really really important and also our working in collaboration with the navy cadets we've worked hard with them in recent months to come up with a memorandum of understanding so that we can have an equal partnership um within within the the reserve boundary so that was one of my things so we we are definitely having united fun uh front between the two organizations and um there are lots of other organizations there's there's the aura there's um frontiers abroad who want to be in there involved in there there's um um see cadets and and so there's lots and lots an important asset this is to the whole of um christchurch the other thing I'm talking to you about is the our playground I know that I've talked to you about it before um but we found out that the funding for its upgrading would be um pushed out so why am I asking you to still bring it forward to originally we were told 2023 would be the year that it might be looked at again and the reason is that um we just have so many people using that playground but it doesn't even come up to the your standard of 90 percent um of youth um I'm trying to think what the word is um 90 percent target for condition we've still not had things replaced which were vandalized and had to be removed we've still not got any seating so older residents can't go sit and sit there and watch what's going on we've still not got any bark although we've been asking for this for years we've not got our bark retained thank you getting lots and lots of use very very practical but there's no there's no accessibility from the disability car park there's no footpaths from the disability car park to the playground area it's still rough and just grass and broken concrete there's also just this week I saw two van loads of young adults with obvious disabilities come to the playground and they had limited access to what was available again I'm asking you to make sure that we have a universal design in the next playground that everybody has equal access and this is so important to well-being socialization everything the community again they spend hours every year we do a working bee in this area we avoided the new plants all summer um so there is a community definite investment in this area and so we're just asking you not to put it off again because we our fear is that it just won't happen because we've been asking for so long do you have any questions no that's come to the end of the time for the uh submission and for all of that background it's very helpful thank you very much thank you
Thank you thank you so uh noleen allen's casper residents association she's trying to blame the councils well good afternoon everybody and I guess that's a really good note to start after amalgamation sometimes history gets lost I'm here to talk about the reserve in casper which I'm not going to call steadfast and I invite you to take that name off your documentation because that was never a name given by the community it was given by council staff briefly the history the land was taken from the local farmers under the public works act to build an armament depot for the navy it belonged to the ministry of defence who decided that the land was no longer required and after lots of consultation banks peninsula district council bought that land they bought it based on a lot of community consultation and I refer you to the visioning document that was produced at the time and certainly under another role that I had with the ministry of social development where I did a lot of surveying of all of the communities from little river and out of the kindness of our hearts we allowed the steadfast group to remain there even though the ministry of defence were going to kick them for touch we supported the young people to still have access to that site also there was use for the community and then amalgamation happened and a sign went up that locked the community out of that reserve and we were threatened with being trespassed if we went into it now the reserve was funded from the reserves fund earthquakes then happened steadfast was allowed back in the community was not what we're now saying is that this is an enormous resource it's a unique piece of land that has potential to support great recreation for the whole of the city the people that recreate on the port hills it fit when we purchased it we bore in mind the whole concept of getting as much of the portals and public ownership we're now in dialogue with the council and we are looking at developing a reserves management plan for the area and we were delighted to see that some not till 2007. 10 we are a community very much like our our cousins in acaroa who are used to rolling their sleeves up and have a history of long standing work jenny and her team have been leading all the reserves planting in that area we have amazing plans that we want to see happen but we do need some support from you we need that funding to be brought forward and to start in the in the coming financial year if you look at casper and you see the growth that's happened in the growth and population the demand for recreation in our in our beaches you will see that the city uses our area widely you will also note there's been a significant amount of money that has come out of that community and into your reserves funds we're not asking for all of that money we're not into jam jar accounting but we think it's fair and responsible to give us some of that money to allow us to develop that reserve and the investment you put into that reserve will be leveraged by the support that the local people will give in rolling their sleeves up and doing the mahi I've also put in in my submission I'd like you to seriously consider that you take steadfast we are not hms steadfast this is a reserve that runs from the main road up to the port hills and the history of steadfast is very small in the history of the area and it has a very good maori name muruku rahi the place of the fire sticks and um I have given you the in in the report I've given you the references to anderson's book on place names of banks peninsula which is the oracle in these matters because I understand from your staff you had they had issues they were struggling with that with that so I've given you the bibliography and I can provide you with the book so hey happy to answer any questions would really want you to consider the wise investment bring those funding forward and on an annual basis in the plan so that we can work together christchurch area thank you thank you we do sort of reference um you know the fact that we are christchurch city the boundaries though expand to banks peninsula and so um the point is is well made until I read your submission I didn't know the history of that area and why it was um hmm steadfast so hms steadfast but thank you very much for your submission and obviously there's a lot of work to be done thank you just give us the tools and we'll do it yes thank you sorry I think the next
Thank you thank you linda sunderland uh chairperson conte pari descendants group good morning everybody and thank you very much for having us here we've had 10 years of trying to work in partnership with the council and that's why as you can see all the council documents it's very hard for us to fit what we need to say in five minutes but I'll talk fast and do my best thank you so we're here um this is patsy little representing the akra cemeteries group myself as chair of the contemporary descendants group peter also and we want to talk about the historic achara cemeteries according to council documents the accra cemeteries should fit into group one of the heritage categories and I think a lot of people within the council don't understand that and recognise it anyway we will go so this is a very early picture of the anglican cemetery they're important because there's some of the earliest cemeteries in canterbury those buried in these cemeteries built and developed the fabric of the european society on banks peninsula the only town in new zealand that was jointly settled by the french in the british government so very important to new zealand history there are many stories in history relevant to banks peninsula and the headstones themselves give a tribe of information valued by researchers and families so they are the final long resting place of our early european pioneers important visiting spaces for their families um and I believe that this is an old powerpoint that has been presented that's not the one I sent through unfortunately yep it is it's an old powerpoint it's not the one I sent through for this meeting what we really wanted to talk about was um the memorial entrance there's two as a group as the two groups we have from 2010 we wrote to mayor bob parker and said we were really concerned about the heritage headstones those of the settlers off the compta parade that was lying in pieces in the akras cemeteries and we wanted to work together with the council to get these fixed from there on we and the council actually promised to four fixed after 10 years so the other issues that have come to being with all our work is that we decided we it would be really nice to build a memorial entrance at the top of the catholic cemetery to honour these early settlers they are so important to our history we also with the akara community were concerned about the state of the cemeteries they were very unkept a lot of the graves were hidden in ivy we have spent two years cleaning them up with the echo our community has also been told there's no more burial space and we knew that there is there's a and it's a shame you haven't_''_219.84 got the proper power point because I could have given you the plan of the large that's that's what the cemeteries were like before we started I'll just see if this is the land that we have cleared before we cleared it it was covered in wilding trees ivy it was just rubbish and had been supposedly maintained by the council but it hadn't we knew that area that is still designated cemetery land what we keep getting from all these council documents is that acura has to go to devotionals why the community has cleared their land they have said this is cemetery land why can't we be buried in accra the important concepts are touring a way and whakapapa for me for a lot of people in acura our families have been buried in here since 1850s and 1860s why does the council persist in saying that we have to be buried and devotional separated from our families separated from the town that is our town of belonging it just does not make sense we just in everywhere we go with the spear cemetery land and with the memorial entrance we just keep hitting we can't do this because we can't_''_310.72 do that because so we keep saying but we've done so much to help you we have cleared the cemeteries up we have fundraised we have worked with the council we have I we have worked with the council to get interpretation panels up so that people know the history't do anything more and we're asking the council to come on board and we particularly look at the community outcomes and strategic planning here and all the lovely words that say let the community own their own future empower communities to make decisions for their communities we are asking the council to please uphold these words we have have support from the akron community the akrai churches the community board has just put through resolutions heritage new zealand has approved this plan they have offered to write a letter of support for fundraising for us we have taken heritage tours in the cemeteries to raise money we have sold wood what more do we do any questions can I just thank you chief I don't know it doesn't say the time yeah no we've come to the end of our time so it's like yeah I mean did you know did you know that the um the heritage incentive grants and the heritage intangible grant criteria there now would allow you to do this work thank you right so um thank you very much detail that you've provided with us I mean people have got a very clear understanding of what the issues are so um it's a challenge that you're putting to us and in our ltp and um obviously uh when two two councils uh amalgamate some of the um history uh has not been carried forward so there's obviously considerable work to be done so thank you very much for your submission thank you thank you so no
Mission and thank you very much thank you thank you anthony goff director paris thank you very much madam mayor and councillors my submission is really quite simple I'm also on the executive of the central city business association we have thought long hard of funding we want to be independent and not a sort of leading always on council for support so that's why we're very strong on being independent having this targeted rate the targeted rate is actually designed on a unit basis so that it means a hotel pays the same as a blank bit of dirt um so the blank bits of dirt will pay a lot more than they might have thought and we have no problem with that um we would like to encourage redevelopment and even if you have a blank bit of dirt like I have on hereford street you'll see we've nicely brassed it and put sprinklers on it and put lighting on it put seats around it so this is part of we probably do things differently at the terrace um so I just wanted rate we need your support to help push it through um the membership we find too if you put money on the table the people become a lot more interested in where it's been spent so that's what we see is going to happen the next thing I want to briefly talk about was that you've got a very small section of tram track that is not finished and it's been put off two or three times and I just want to reinforce please don't put it off please complete it it makes a huge difference because then they can run um the trams with a trailer behind the moment they can't run those because they have to turn the thing around or rather just swap the loop over but you can't push it a carriage in front of the tram so it's quite important for our future development that that small bit of train track is not delayed and it's finished and it will make a huge difference particularly with our bubble opening to australia um so those are the open questions thank you and I won't run out of time I think we've run out of time but look thank you very much for your presentation it's much appreciated thank you thank you
Okay thank you um we've got annabelle turley uh chair central city business association and I see that welcome sorry to keep you waiting we're gonna this is nikki carter the secretary of the central city business association the central city business association has 500 members who run businesses in our central city our city is entering a really exciting phase of the regeneration process with all those anchor projects coming on board finally the ccbi is placed in a really good position to support our members and the businesses as our city regenerates our executive has nine members who are all volunteers and we're all very very passionate about our city we're supporting a targeted rate for funding for the central city business association this is to provide certainty to enable us to plan for the medium and long-term future um and the funding would be from the central city businesses not the general rate payers and I believe and I think the whole executive belief that for christchurch to thrive we actually need a really thriving central city thank you all right do we you have any members in the hoyts index complex and yes we do do you know how businesses are going in there yani could you wait could we please focus on the on the reason why we're here which is our long-term plan okay so I guess I was just interested like like it seems like this I know you think you have a small great interest in these methods but let's deal with that in a place that's appropriate for that sarah I'm happy to talk to you after yeah I was just wondering if there was any observations things we could do small local businesses how would you see the sort of membership of the ccba working once there's a sort of a rate coming from every every property um so currently it's kind of you sign up would would membership do you think be automatic then for all of those that we're paying or well it would it would be because it would be with a targeted rate yeah and you see that then leading into something in the future a targeted rate or like instead of or is it a tr like a hybrid model would be ideal yeah going down the future yeah yeah I think I think the targeted rate is the as a really efficient and simple way of collecting from all the businesses in the city and if you if it's a membership based model and people have to pay there's a lot of for the amount of the membership fees there's a lot of cost associated with actually administering that so that's why we support the targeted rate because it's a nice clean way to to actually um collect from all the businesses in the city and you're okay with the the way that it's done the way that the target rate is done or would you like something slightly different um I'm we're quite happy with that we've spent quite a lot of time with the urban regeneration team working out a way that was like fair yeah for everyone um because some some ways that they were targeted on a unit so paid a lot more and and it wasn't really equal whereas yeah the targeted rate seems to be the best way to get and and once you've got a higher membership from this you may need more so staffing those kind of things to be in contact with people and that kind of thing do you see the amount itself is enough um are you gonna there could be more work involved with a rather high membership and stuff yeah I think what what we're hoping is that we start off with with what we've requested this year and do a strategic plan for the next three to five years and actually prove our worth and as we hit some of our goals and meet our targets then we'd hope to increase the request for for that funding on a year-on-year basis but actually prove that we're achieving our goals and targets and adding value for the businesses in the city great thanks um andrew thank you I'm interested in the um request for a grant of 150 000 in the next financial a foundation in place to achieve strategic goals can you just expand on that a little bit what would you do with 150 000 well the first step for us is we want to put a strategic plan in place and engage with our members and ask what they'd like us to do but it also means that we'll be able to put more focus into some of the events to bring people into the central city and um and actually drive some of that footfall and raise awareness of what's in the city now thank you I think this has been a very powerful um statement in here around the uh a vibrant central city makes a vibrant city but where that's been actually expanded and accepted is the greater christchurch area as well that our central city is the central city for greater christchurch and I think that this model of moving to a targeted rate with all of the strategic planning ahead of it I think that will enable it to happen so thank you very much for a very good submission and thank you very much thank you
As people have arrived for the next set of appointments since we've got behind um so uh eric paulson from the um waitakere eco-central eco-centric eco sanctuary trust thank you very much we represent the waitakere ecosanctuary trust this is bruce white our chair and I'm eric paulson and the basis of our submission is that we would like to see much clearer leadership and clarity of direction with respect to the future of the taikaro avon river corridor the former red zone in the ltp this would really help groups like ours that have existed whose projects have existed for some years to deliver on the promise that is the red zone there are four brief aspects of this that we've uh put in our submission the first is we really do need some coordination and leadership on the question of a long-term co-governance structure to secure delivery of the objectives of the river corridor regeneration plan as somebody who's been involved in this on and off for some years it really is rather like um dealing with a fog and everything dealing in a uh things seem to slip through one's grasp again so it would be very helpful uh to know how where to secure a process of decision making about long-term governance the second is adequate funding for delivery of the plan as we read the ltp the first allocation of council funds is not for some years we would like to see that brought forward to indicate that council actually has a commitment to delivering on the objectives of the plan in the river corridor the third is that we would uh ideally like some clarity within council this is a management point as to which senior manager has overall guardianship for the vision of the delivery of the plan at the moment it's very hard to know whether you're dealing with engineers planners people in the parks department and multiple middle managers rather than clarity at the management level as to who has responsibility and where uh groups like ours are to go and the the last point the fourth point is to respect the history of community engagement in the river corridor which produced the plan staff work collaboratively with manufa and with citizens rather than presenting us with predetermined initiatives and plans that are put out for consultation so those are our four key points I think bruce would like to add a few words I was going to emphasize the collaboration aspect and I've been fascinated to listen to the broad oaks people talking about their wish to collaborate so I won't go into that I think you've heard enough about collaboration and the wishes of the community in every way but the the other thing I'd like to talk about is what is holding up progress and put to you that the the central question around the uh the river corridor is what are the constraints that are holding things up because we're now 10 years on from from the the large quakes and there's a lot of groups have wanted to make progress and yes it just goes on and on so I i ask you what is what are the constraints what are the blocks that are preventing progress and let's remove those and well in your view what other constraints I'm putting the question to you yeah from any observations though that the the four points that we've made okay so this governance lack of clarity with respect to management is a certain amount of financial commitment and it's it's a question of engaging with us rather than presenting us with we want to engage those four points and for the project uh we're talking about it's a significant uh piece of the red zone land and it involves the stop banks and involves new brighton road and those sorts of things we want to collaborate we have the skill set ourselves within our trustees to collaborate sensibly on a professional level so that's what we want to do and the sooner the better that's very good thank you very much for making this mission and I'm hoping that we'll at least have a little bit of some progress on the co-governance one very shortly thank you thanks thank you thank you very much um so we're we're down for a schedule so I'm just going to suggest that you take five minutes
Um so andrew craig follow on from bob thank you um I don't know how many of you have actually been into the reserve or are familiar with it if you haven't I would encourage you to go along and I'll be more than happy to accompany you if you if need be um I don't want to go repeat what mr schultz and mr burnett have said you've got a very good clear picture of what's happening in the reserve even though my submission is essentially a personal one you would have gathered from it that I am the volunteer coordinator for a group of volunteers who work in the reserve and I just want to describe a little bit about what we do because I believe it has a bearing on the budget allocation so every friday morning our volunteers meet and when I say our volunteers there's usually about three of us sometimes there's five of us we're all at the older end of the spectrum mostly retirees we work for about two hours um and then after main task and it's not very glamorous is putting out weeds and when we talk about weeds in the reserve we're not just talking about blackberry old man's beard agapanthus broom tree lucerne we're also talking about azuri has been alluded to in previous submissions wattles gumtrees welding pines now the council we work closely with the council ranger miss heidi wilton and we have a very good relationship with her and as she is as supportive as she can be last year we got some funding to cut down some pine trees that didn't come from the city council that actually came from the regional council and that was the basis of the funding that I've indicated in my submission um now since then I've become aware of mr schultz's submission in the funding sort there the council discourages us and in fact forbids us from using power tools in the reserve and that's understandable because you know we're amateurs when it comes to chainsaws and we want to avoid unscheduled amputations and such such like and so we the approach taken by mr schwaltz is the one that I prefer where whereby we go into the reserve we hit it hard and we hit it once and I feel that if we do that we as volunteers can do a lot to maintain the reserve as it stands at the moment when we're in the reserve doing our work people often walk past us and they'll say well you know you're doing a nice job there um and I'm tempted to hand them some hand tools to help us out it doesn't usually happen and um but I do say to them look you know this is a job that's not just going to take years or decades it's intergenerational you know it's beyond it's just absolutely daunting it's overwhelming so I figure that if we can hit it hard hit it once deal to the the pines the gums and everything else we can manage it after that at the moment it's a case of two steps forward one and a half steps back so that very much it's a very clear and the grouping of the three submissions together I think has really enabled the council to get a really good understanding of the area so thank you for that I'm sure some of us will take the opportunity of popping up there to have a look at the reserve I mean I've driven up there but um I must admit I have never got out of the car and yeah certainly worth doing it and it's pretty aerobic it's quite steep but yeah with worth going thank you very much very good thank you and um the last person before a break which I'm hesitant to sort of say because
Thank you we've got um bob burnett kia ora mia leanne councillors residents thank you for the opportunity to talk regrettably I haven't had time to do a written submission a wider submission but as one of the residents in board oaks I thought it's important to support the previous submission and I think after nine years of waiting for my insurance I'm about two weeks away from moving back into my house up in broad oaks and this reserve is on my backyard and my major concerns um my expertise isn't in reserves and landscapes and things I think andrew craig who will talk next as a landscape architect who has more expertise in that my my um area is sustainable building and housing but um seems like there's a lot of things going on at the moment and um submission seems like almost a full-time job but it doesn't put food on the table with the changes to the building code and climate change and things so I think this is a great opportunity to add and improve the biodiversity of lot of bell birds and and the trees there's a lot of trees that are gum trees and um that are quite invasive and actually uh to the detriment of other native plants they suck the moisture out of the soil and the nutrients out of the soil after sort of 10 years of being away from the region I've never seen it so dry it's tender dry there's a lot of rubbish on the ground branches they self prune these gum trees and um there's this dead bark and um it's it's a powder kick something needs to be done to um it's a real serious fire risk the other concern is the road safety there's um you know one of the neighbors when we were actually living there uh all those years ago one of the neighbors had a near fatal accident head on on a bicycle into a car just talking to the others there's been a handful of accidents that they're aware of collisions on that road there needs to be yellow lines on the you have to cross the white line to to get around them very dangerous so that's an important thing I think if this reserve was developed as a walking track and a cycle track perhaps it would take pedestrians and cyclists off that road there's not continuous footpaths the footpaths go from one side to the other and it's usually at a bend on the road so it's very dangerous if that track was planned and developed well enough it would be great because it's actually a shorter distance and it would be much safer um that's probably all I've got to talk about so thank you for your time and I'll hand over to the next person thank you thank you very much um so andrew
Got robin schultz member of the broad oaks residence community thank you um my name is robin schultz I'm a representative of the broad oaks community uh we understood we had two five-minute slots but we just found out we've we haven't_''_28.08 um there was two separate submissions made one on the coronation reserve and one on the road reserve are two separate issues and mikey was able to speak on the latter one if we can fit it in but to save time um I'll talk about the coronation reserve firstly I understand that you've got a full copy of our submission yeah yeah and it's an extremely extensive one I was going to congratulate you on the detail that you have provided so and everyone's read it so if you look at the attachment it was a powerpoint presentation given to the community board yeah that's more explicit and I hope you've got the color photographs very graphic very summarizes the issues but um the basic issue is we have a major problem in this area the earthquakes stopped're no argument with that but since then it's overgrown and it's a major fire risk major fire risk uh we had all your staff had the chief rural fire officer standing on my deck trying to work out how they're going to fight the fire from my place if I caught fire 12 years ago the 100 meters away the valley did catch fire so it was a real issue we all have also have a problem with our insurance companies that we should be telling them about this and we don't want to do that um but we need to have some direct action immediately to rectify this issue the the overgrowth the whole reserve is overgrown and it's causing other issues of pests uh possums rats defecating on everyone's property eating their gardens etc that's well documented in the powerpoint presentation so the solution our view is the whole reserve needs to be addressed as a total redevelopment fulton hogan gave you a pup the council accepted it yeah you were taken for a ride that needs to be rectified work that we're now faced with 2008 the council adopted a plan to do it everyone is happy with the plan might be some minor tweaks I understand in 2008 the budget was 400 000 it's now being costed independently by the council staff it's 950 000. if we wait another five years it's going to be 1.5 million so I think we need to collectively come to an arrangement to form a group the residents are fully behind this there's a lot of them sitting behind me they've got their own groups and we're keen to see this happen um we note that the long-term plan has got 480 000 over 10 years you're wasting rate powers money it's going to go nowhere in three years it'll be overgrown it'll be the same problem and that's happened twice already so we can't just have half the money over a longer period you need to fund the whole thing uh so we get at least the capital works done and that's going to solve the problem there's already birds native birds there's been two he's seen up there bell birds native falcons I happen to be in zealandia on saturday in wellington every council needs to go and see that it is fantastic this is a mini one of that we won't have predefenses that sort of thing but with prudent management by the residents who are keen to get involved this is a potential mini zealandia and we're missing opportunities if we don't do this the 480 000 uh what's in the plan and I understand is now supported by the community board and you found this out yesterday uh won't go anywhere you need to fund the whole lot an issue that's in the powerpoint presentation is the average rate in christchurch is two thousand eight hundred dollars for the average property the average rate up on this hill is over seven thousand five hundred there's people here who pay twelve thousand five hundred for rates so on average is about four a half thousand dollars per property paid every year above the average want a fair success that four thousand dollars per annum for 300 watts is 1.3 million every year over above the average rate for 13 years we've waited as 14 million has been recovered from this area and not one dollar has been paid except for some minor roading maintenance so we need to you need to keep that in mind that we've paid our rates regularly we want a bit back we want 900 000 is not a lot of money in that context our suggestion is that we you fund the 900 000 over say a four to five year period a couple hundred thousand a year and the staff and the community get together with a project team and we have expertise on that hill that can help there's one guy who owns a irrigation company happy to put his time and money in because some of us got project management experience as engineers and it'll save money we'll get it done properly and efficiently so that's the main part about the reserve the road um thank you for the work sealed some of the uh vital corners it's a much better road now but the rest of the road uh reserve needs urgent attention there's about five hundred thousand dollars worth of work which the council staff believe is fair and reasonable um that needs to be tended to it's the whole area is depreciating because of the council not maintaining their own assets so the council have admitted to us that some of it slipped through the system understand that let's get it right let's provide some mechanism for funding and that we can move on from there so I urge the council to look at our submission and um look at the council's own staff budget of 950 000 for the reserve and the 500 000 for the road and I think it will be accepted over a period of time three to four to five years to get all that sorted I think will be a reasonable proposition happy to answer questions well but we've come to the end of the time but thank you so much because I think already heard this morning have really focused on how the community could work in partnership with council to make things happen in a in a particularly particularly focused way based on local knowledge and that you've really emphasized that in in your oral submission it was already evidenced in the submission and the presentation you made to the community board so thank you very much for that
Uh the next one is david east welcome hit another one of our former councillors here yesterday I'm going to be reasonably blunt and to the point and I've made five copies to circulate three minutes isn't a hell of a lot of time um so I'm going to speak primarily on the state of roads in the eastern suburbs and go on record as supporting a substantive submission from the north beach residents association and also the submission from the new brighton roading road group action action group I should say um just a few little bullet points marine parade it was in the 2010 annual plan a long-term plan for a full reconstruction it was removed quite rightly so after the earthquake series it's never been reinstated it has leaking water pipes rough surface and a deteriorating deep ditch gutter the signet street output this regularly blocks in heavy rainfall and floods the area around cygnet street and leave the terrace and it was again there was funding in the last ltp perhaps not enough but in this ltp there's nothing so brighton road has suffered badly from earthquake damage and a prevalent reason given over a number of years for a lack of attention as well we haven't decided where the new stop banks are going to be located simply build the stop banks where the road is now make them wide enough to incorporate a cycle way and you've got a win-win for everyone concerned I believe that an audit of all roads in the city for damage to the surface roughness and state of footpaths and gathers is long overdue I acknowledge that roads of high use need regular attention but all roads need a rating based on the above and a program of repair for roads of highest damage implemented in recent weeks has been the usual flurry of spending roading budgets and we've had a huge flurry around the area of bitumen and chip seal on a number of our roads and some of the photos that are covered there today show footpath damage and particularly edge to road damage that was never attended to when they've done this um work I just a lumpy road and the roads in our area are still very very lumpy thank you thank you you covered a lot of ground in the in the time available did anyone have any questions no thank you very much
Yeah uh we have mark wells from rickland community church welcome tenekoto tenekoto tenekota katoa madam mia councillors thank you for hearing our submissions um it's always encouraging to be able to be part of the decision-making in our city um I'm speaking to just one very small area of the long-term plan uh looking at uh rates remissions for community um non-profits uh and the the suggestions that that uh those rates remissions should stop at a certain kind of bank account that a um a community group might hold but my understanding of that remission is not um a subsidy to help smaller nonprofits to go ahead but simply an acknowledgement by the city that they do good in the city that is their purpose that's the why they exist and I i find it very odd then that if you reach a certain size where economies of scale kick in where you're more able to offer services we are more able to make a difference the city would stop saying thank you for that um that seems um counter logic to me now that does make a difference um so my name's mark um I'm one of the pastors at wrecking community church I'm also on the board for community development network trust which is a major youth trust um in the western part of the city I also sit on a board of trustees for my local school um and I'm just gradually putting my toe in the water of volunteering for um horme hockey um I'm not sure how much I can do so I have a reasonable understanding of what the nonprofit sector looks like and for non-profits we we are masters at making things work our budgets are often very small and for those who rely on grants we you often have a whole bunch of grant money for the activity that you're doing for the good that you want to do but no one actually wants to give to edmund administration is the hardest piece of money to get a hold of and the hardest piece of money to use well and this rates if we stop getting the rates remission then part to fund and so while you might look at a nonprofit's bank account and say hey look you've got this amount of money a lot of that is tagged to particular purposes so it's actually really really difficult to then be able to claw back that somewhere else and what it ends up being is that you end up pulling back on services or you end up needing to have more volunteers doing what you could have someone paid to it just gets really challenging sometimes to pull out those particular pieces and particularly admin is really really challenging as opposed to activity fees everyone loves giving to activity fees to the direct services that we do but often it's the admin that kind of makes things fall over so what I'm encouraging you to do is allow us to have the economies of scale allow us to to grow and to have the kind of financial stability and responsibility that you want us to have without then penalizing us by saying by stopping that kind of that acknowledgement of the good that we the argument it's very simple um but I'd be keen if you have any um any thoughts thank you dude I think people are generally there's they've been quite a number of submissions along the same line and actually the community boards as well without exception I think as I recall yeah well and that's just the acknowledgement that um because they the community non-profits um we work hand-in-hand with the council we deliver a lot of the same goals that the council has and and very little of that actually is council funded we really appreciate the grants that we do get but particularly for a church there's actually a very very tiny portion of what we do that fits within the council criteria for funding because a lot of it is kind of brushed over with promotion of religion oh we can't fund that uh but um so we do get a small amount but most of it comes from our donors our people who give and again um it's much much easier to ask people for money for um administration and again um so picking out that one point of what's your bank account oh then you don't get a rate remission um misses that the the nuance of that uh and so uh and particularly for other non-profits who are much more grants funded um or they have contracts with government again the contracts they they force you into a particular thing you must deliver in this area and often the admin is the bit that misses out yeah so I think we've heard that from a number of groups too which is why I think the the flexibility and the funding arrangements has been here at the council for that reason yeah yeah okay well thank you very much for your submission much appreciated thank you thank you have a good day you too the next one is
Um so uh the next one is christine baxter who's president of the friends of christchurch libraries kia ora thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak to our submission um our purpose in being here today is because to us many of the proposed reductions and services currently offered by christchurch city libraries make us wonder if you are fully aware of the important part that the library service plays in the lives of your residents and ratepayers or how attached they are to it in fact the residence surveys consistently show a 95 satisfaction rate with library services so the library service is really in our opinion your flagship it is the one service that most um people will know about um sorry I meant to introduce us I've just realized I so I'm chris baxter president of the friends of christchurch city libraries this is barbara hart who is the immediate past president of the same organization and both barbara and I are retired career librarians so we we do speak with a little bit of knowledge about um about this we from responsible we believe that it actually runs far more out of every dollar that you give it than just that one dollar paleo the the the proposals that we want to speak to a reduction of the fingertip libraries from a monday to sunday service to a monday to friday we find it quite hard to believe why people would think that the general public wouldn't have a need for specialized information at the weekend right the the businesses that you are very keen to see prosper would have access at a time when maybe they've got time to actually investigate access to quality information which the fingertip library staff are able to supply or they can direct people to where they would find their information people whose weekday lives are full will also be busy at weekends and they may not have time to visit library for information but we know that they certainly do call on fingertip for what they're seeking to find plus there is the library on live service where people can actually have a conversation with a librarian through their computers and end of the phone's excellent knowledge so um the next thing that we wish to talk about is the proposal to disband the mobile library service when the current vehicle is retired in 2022 we just wonder if you really have really seriously considered the impact that this will have on some of our communities most disadvantaged and vulnerable people the mobile library visit is a bright spot in the wake for people who are isolated by distance or by circumstance maintaining the service will be a visible demonstration of your commitment to in the concern for their well-being to disband the service might demonstrate or might seem to people that you don't care about them and rationalizing the opening hours across similar-sized libraries this too ignores those whose lives do not enable them to fit into a neat little grid these people people are rate payers too whose needs deserve to be met consider the hard-working parent at 6 00 pm there's the babies that are on hand the kids are bathed and ready for bed and the local library is open until seven consider also at six pm a family member or someone else is home from work has time to run them to the local library which is open until seven for these people this is the golden um thank you for listening we hope that you will give favorable consideration to our submission and we believe that all of the services currently offered by christchurch city libraries play an irreplaceable role in the social and economic well-being of our city thank you thank you very much it's um very uh very poignant um submission and well representing that thank you support of the friends without whom our libraries would not be the places that they are so thank you for what you do thank you we have mark wells
Back to yesterday's um submissions sorry can you give me the number of the submission so I'm having difficulty with my hub six six seven so driscilla king patterson so it was from yesterday so um so that was from last night so if you'd like to come forward driscilla we'll hear your submission now do you wanna sit here um thank you first of all I'd like to apologize it was a bit of a mix-up but anyway I'll just run through really quick okay you can sit down if you wish yeah yeah I like that right um first of all uh green moon studios the chalice in the square we then had fanfare which was built and put on out on the motorway kaipoi when you go past that at seven o'clock at night when the lights all change that is green moon and I've actually been working eight years on a play santa's last key because when the moon comes out santa needs help so we're on the pros of doing that that's eight years earthquake we break we're brave and I didn't bring it but the logo is actually a covered 19 robot dog and his name's toa and the whole play is all written around him okay I notice with regards to the anglican cathedral sometime further on down the track it may need extra funding and it still has community support um lancaster park I'm actually planning part of it is a polar bear festival for 227 and I've been talking to groups my husband lived in mercy road for 16 years I lived there and lancaster park is really really important and what I'm concerned is we're going to have a generation of young people who are not fit we have another major emergency earthquake so the idea is you have sports bet what you don't know is I'm one of the founding members for the rodeo there's 40 of us set the roadie up in canterbury rodeo in ahoka right that costs a hundred grand a day with this one because it comes under the umbrella of the council I so I've been following what's been happening and I'm already working on the branding right now so that's why the polar bear is quite quite important um I was involved I must admit and I hate to admit it the commonwealth games we did round the world in 80 days with the elmwood players and that was the start of peter elliott's career he I actually did the dance with his brother I was the girl on the boat and then I did operatic repertory and then of course I as a cabinet maker I've gone into construction my husband now has just had been in hospital with him all over christmas I was looking to move over to the templeton side or into town he now has the early stages of dementia so I'm dealing with that okay and a lot of people are dealing with that um the toilets in the metro stop I actually would love if we had a lot of money a fast rail going from the back of the bus exchange and I actually hopped on the could have turned around had fast rail going from the back of the rail all the way up to the hospital all the way up so then young people would come from canterbury university on their scooters catch and go all the way to through to lincoln and the reason for that is is the dynamics of our life is moving more into you've got the cannabis industry which will grow I'm looking at berries um agriculture is going to be a really big deal and how do people get from waimakariri eat all up north over to lincoln in the day and what happens is a lot of them have to move and this has been happening for the last 20 30 years so it was very interesting to see um what report came out that was on the news this morning about the government going to fund rail so I'll be looking at that I did go to all the rail meetings um I think I've pretty oh other than the templeton site and just you won't be able to see this but following it for the last five years go up start it um pasta huanui cape valley come all the way if you had fast rail then you could get the guys from the prison they could go up there and do forestry cape valley they have to be there by six at night and then rolliston's going to open up and the thing is too what you may not realize is beef and lamb no the lamb organisation and ash burton they own the yarn factory in burnside which is the only machine for doing hemp all right and there's a group of young guys that won a scholarship up in huanui for food stuff and they can only do so much so so that industry will actually open up but I'm more interested in um the berries um I come we've we're part of a family farm up in taranaki the eewee's getting into berries up there and um just the other thing is with film now the uh thank you now but one thing is um whatever I say if I gave it it can do if you because I've got a document I don't want on the internet okay um because it's commercially sensitive yeah we yeah no this is just telling people what I've done how much I've laid out but I don't want other people no well it's commercially sensitive so if you could just put confidential on it and give a hard copy to staff and it won't go on the internet thank you so thank you but look thank you driscilla we really appreciate the fact that you care enough that every year you come you've thought about the integration across a number of plans and you speak to all of them I really appreciate it so thank you the key is I just want to have fun and make movies I know you do thank you yeah we'd rather do that too
Um david hawk good evening okay cure thanks for taking the time to listen to us today so uh beside me is john bennett who's chair of household residents association and I'm the secretary so there are two themes that we want to bring to you today one's a sort of glass half empty thing and the other is a glass half full theme so we'll start first with the glass half empty which is the question of the long term plan consultation process last year in our annual plan submission we said that city council needs to develop a strategy for encouraging all demographics in our community we're just bearing that in mind we're going to focus on our experience this time around in obtaining more detail on three particular projects in the long term plan they're numbered out in our written submission but cart club relocation coryman's trail connections and wigram hayton so if we pick up the wigram hayton one first with the help of andre moore a community board member we got a quick response from the engagement on the other hand requires a very deep breath we emailed councillor galloway on the 8th of march and she promptly forwarded the questions that we had to the chief executive's office and after that silence so 8th of march is nearly 2 months ago until we raised the issue with councillor galloway again this morning she quickly got a reply and apparently the project that we're talking about shouldn't have even been in the long term plan quarryman's trail cycle connections we emailed pretty much as soon as the consultation opened questions immediately acknowledged by your engagement team but after that silence then on saturday which is some time after the consultation closed we got an email with some plans except the plans were for the cycleway itself which is built and in use not the project that is in the long term plan interacting with the staff and your engagement team has been really really positive we put we think they put their hearts into their jobs the problem we see if we bring this across the three projects I've talked about is turn says that as a council you're not taking consultation seriously and we suspect from the issue with the cart club project and other areas that have come into the long-term plan that the resourcing of the long-term plan preparation hasn't been done adequately either I'd have to say we spend a lot of time in putting together our submissions and all this mucking around we think that as a council you're taking a rather cavalier approach to people like us and our committee who put a lot of work in on behalf of our communities but I thought we'll put the happy side now which is your strengthening community's team and its funding the projects that we run as an association the anzac commemoration is the most visible they have a seamless and enthusiastic backing of your staff on your behalf we're currently working on a heritage project again with the strong and enthusiastic backing of your staff on your behalf the projects that I've just mentioned and other ones that we're involved in could not easily be done by have come alongside us for these projects so thanks for listening kia ora I'm just going to allow a little bit of leeway in terms of time here as well because I'm your submission was one of the ones that I read and specifically not by name mentioned in my star column where I talked about people who'd raised the fact that they had to rely on institutional knowledge for the memory of things that had come and gone and it isn't good enough and it is something that we are um working with staff on to make sure that we've got a better way of communicating with particular particularly in the residential areas where the knowledge about the background to all of these projects is so great so I love the fact that you ended on that on that positive note about working in partnership tim thank you very much for your um submission just with regards to point e with um the pt for lincoln road oh right yeah and I know you'll be we've been very sensitive about that going to waltham and those wonderful old suburbs so we just be we're just taking a time to be sensitive to the eddington community there's no question we're all on the same boat with us and pt and cycle lanes but we do have to be respectful for those older um communities it's going to go through and with regards to kotahi with regards to hazel road one of the issues that has come up and concerns with the local community as rowley have been identified by many as a rat run and it's got a school it's a low decile area so we really want to just be careful and sensitive about that so but it's we're all on the same boat but we just want to be and I'm sure have been very respectful of those communities so just but we haven't_''_342.0 we're not going slow we're just being respectful and thank you all right between you and me we went to the transport agency drop in on the state highway 75 consultation and we asked them city council and they said huh what and I guess I'm not sure whether it's in our submission but what we see is agencies not talking to each other no that we have been they've come to our community board we had a really good session with them and um carolyn potter was there and you can imagine if they'd done anything wrong she would have ripped them apart so yeah so it's surprising they should said that because we have been in contact yeah because we were in touch with them about the um need to look at it at speed limits um past little maybe the people undertaking the engagement hadn't been engaged with that but you know I agree with you that it's perhaps an example of where a more collaborative engagement process would have been more sensible to um to to develop but I do want to acknowledge your sensitivity towards those other communities it's always been first rate so thank you very much for that guys cheers thank you yeah I'm sarah thanks so much and um how would you apart from the the actual resourcing itself to do things um and the final extra information how would you suggest that we do things differently to capture those demographic groups and those kind of things next time around or in other consultations we do yeah it's a real challenge because if you think of the situation I think you've got about two and a half thousand submissions is that right yeah they though quite a few of the group ones represent from 20 to 100 people okay but but if you multiplied you know an effective consultation you might have had instead of two and a half thousand you might have had twenty five thousand yeah and how would you how would the current system cope with instead of 400 people wanting to talk to you 4 000 people wanting to talk to you and and one of the things there's a you know there's a lot of discussion around the world about a more deliberative approach and if you think of the way for example like lots of people bring this which was more at a sort of community level bringing things together and that sort of acted as a distillation that then went up to higher levels and one of the I can't remember his name but one of your previous submitters talked about participatory um budgeting yeah and and that potentially is part of that it's it's really interesting the international literature says you've got to be really careful about that sort of thing because if you you know you pick your um topic and all you end up with is fist fights and um so so you know but um it costs a lot more time and money but that sort of more ground-level participatory sort of approach might be one way forward thank you yeah that's good yeah I think that the the linking the community boards and their residence associations into more of a workshop format would actually work quite well if we had but to resource that which would be because you know um there are some submissions have come in on on particular subjects as soon as we've the individual submissions have dropped away because they know that the issues are going to get canvassed in a more expensive way than they would do by a three-minute series of slots all saying the same thing so yeah I guess one of the like this is sort of uh just sort of shooting myself in the foot a wee bit but as a residence association we can't claim that we represent the entire demographics as possible and and community boards really struggle to reach out into the community so you know there's quite a bit of work to go in there well let's do some thinking about how we might make that happen and we can do it outside of the ltp process as a lead up to an ltp process I think but anyway thank you very much for your extensive work that you've put into your submission and providing me with some fodder for my star column so thank you very much all right thank you thanks for listening priscilla's not here yet
Thank you very much uh the next is david mcgimpsey condole condell condole retirement village may I say just at the start that I do wear two hearing aids so I hope I'm speaking at the right volume for you and I hope to receive you fine I'm speaking to the submission that was made by the residents of condole village on the condition of condell avenue from the ayarangi matson's corner up to blys road this stretch of avenue is the address for places like laid or college condole retirement village and the oceana healthcare village which has just been opened it is also the main route to waimari primary school best start preschool and lollipops kindergarten these are all 30 to 100 metres from the condole and bly's road corner all these colleges retirement villages schools generate a lot of daily transport and pedestrian movements by vehicles bikes scooters and skateboards and by foot you can probably well imagine by the places I've just outlined there there is all types of transport it is imperative there are smooth and safe surfaces for all surfaces of the stretch of ponder avenue have not been at a safe acceptable standard since the damage that was called by the city earthquakes and have deteriorated every year since a major factor but not the only one but a major factor of this is the fact that the crown of the road was hugely pushed up into the air by the earthquakes and it is now well above the level of the footpaths and the gutters the submitted visual presentation of random photos shows you in some way illustrating what we we're dealing with the photo of the part car on a lean is the result of the crown of the road being pushed up to the extent of what it is many cows that need to park on condole avenue when they open the door of the car it scrapes on the footpath which is not good because the car is on so much of a lean our submission employs the council to carry out major restructuring of this whole section of the avenue to rectify an increasingly dangerous situation for everyone and particularly the children walk many with sticks and frames and drive on this carriageway both these age groups are prone for to easily trip stumble and fall on cracks ridges potholes and bumps which you will see there is plenty of it is appreciated that this work will require allocation of funds but putting that to one side I would say that this is very much a decision on health and safety for citizens of all ages I hope you will be able to give this your due consideration thank you for your listening thank you I i wanted to acknowledge the photographs that you sent through in support of the submission as well they they're sort of quite um quite good so thank you for that because they do give a very um clear indication of this um status of the um of the roads and I think we're going to get to quickly look at those the condition of the guttering and one place there with the gutter um well in several places there was so much damage we now just have bare shingle in the bottom of the questions uh jimmy this is a severe damage in particular country ever have you have you talked to your local community board or talked to the council staff beforehand yes I'm pleased you asked that tonight what's the response thank you I'm pleased you asked that and I was going to mention it we did have um emma norrish who is the chairperson of the community board for our area speaking at our village a few weeks ago and it was a good opportunity for emma to be made aware of what we're dealing with she was not aware of that and after the meeting went out and did quite a bit of walking up and down and communicated with me later that she did not realize there was so much damage there and that there are so many people have to try and negotiate that damage whether it's right or wrong I don't know but I'm pretty sure she did say that it is on your works agenda but for another three or four years out and we would contend that this people involved the age groups involved and the damage that has been incurred thank you thank you for your submission um thank you for presenting it in a way that's very clear and um we appreciate all of the effort that you've gone to to make your submission today so thank you thank you
Um on behalf of the waiakura linwood central heathcote community board I want to start by thanking you all for the opportunity to present today I also wanted to start by thanking michelle lomax for her work as submissions chair and I know she would have liked to have been here today I'd like to start by framing our ko papa the waikota board have gone with the less is more approach which is obviously not what we've discussed earlier today but we believe a succinct submission is appropriate our submission today is based on our community board plan of which the board continually raises and we're sure you'll be well acquainted with it by now we want to acknowledge the context of our post covert environment and the strain on council's budget moving forward we totally understand there have been and will be many difficult decisions to be made the board thank you all for the mahi you have all put in up until this point and we know the time you will all put in around this important piece of work will be of involving the community and the spending of budgets in the area and ensuring that promises from council about operational spend are kept now I would like to outline the demographics of the waikouta community board it's a vast area with wide-ranging socio-economic spread it is important for us to recognize that while we have a range of demographics throughout our ward area the linwood ward has significant need with almost 50 per cent of our community living between levels 9 and 10 on the deprivation scale the board recognizes these figures and would like to state the support for our most vulnerable is the reason for our comments around rates water and uniform annual general charge I briefly wanted to mention the engagement with community with the community from the board and how we've got through to today's point the board had been engaging directly with community in different ways since the beginning and even prior to commencement with this current term we have actively attended community galas farmers markets malls and also had a community forum to get feedback from the community rather than expecting of connecting in local places the board also consulted widely on the board plan of which the submission is based we both have encouraged and supports our missions from our local groups such as the phillipstown hub the victorian neighborhood association in regards to gracefield avenue and its upgrade to be rescheduled and the redcliffe's residents association along with many other groups and individuals we thank them for taking the time to prepare and send their submissions in in order to support their communities I'm quite sure you have all read and are familiar with these submissions onto our core priorities as I said earlier the submission is based on our community board plan and priorities and I'm sure you're all aware of our major projects by now as we attempt to keep you all updated as we receive and have relevant information and progress to share our number one is of course to po toy toy uh linwood pool you all know this is well underway and will be opening at the end of the year and the board want to say a massive thank local people into local jobs we have a community celebration for the opening planned for october and allowing greater outcomes for all in our community there have been there has been so much work happening in collaboration with staff elected members and the community and this work will enable growth of the wider community into the future our three main board plan projects are bromley traffic concerns greening of the east and the apawah lower heath kit working party all are underway but will need additional support as they progress we are hoping that the urban forest strategy will help green the wide and grey streets of the east of the central city the board has not asked for big capital spend but realigned operational spending from programs already underway and always in collaboration with the affected communities we will be vigilant in ensuring this happens the board would like to ensure our master plan projects stay on the budget recognising that ferry road linwood and sydney are all lower socioeconomic areas and are still impacted by lingering earthquake issues while the forward laning of the top end of fury for pedestrians in this area and would like to see this looked at properly and promptly we are thankful to see the money on budget for the sumner village green in the parks budget but note it is out three years from the build of the skate park we would like to strongly advocate to see this funding come forward in alignment with the base gate part work in order for more timely and financial efficiency by council council have been clear in the past that aligning work makes sense and we see a huge opportunity for this in this instance the waikota board also have a lens on sustainability when looking at our projects so understandably cycleways especially our local links are of importance to the board and we advocate for seeing them connected both well designed and efficiently the new ferry road innovating streets project which we've all heard about today looks great and having something similar to provide safe access in other areas would encourage more people to cycle the board have had a lot of feedback around the yellow in a city's shuttle we a useful way to travel especially with a growing inner city and support this form of public transport while public transport is an ecan matter we believe this could be something initiated by council as it has been in the past in regards to community funding the board would not support cuts to community grants the added value of communities to communities far outweighs the monetary value and in seeing this also keeps local people locally employed community groups support the most vulnerable in our city and support community resilience building food resilience sustainability and biodiversity outcomes they make the most of a huge number of volunteers and are essential to support can you imagine having to pay staff to do the amount of work that these volunteers do or not having any of these groups at all getting back to the y quarter boards kaupapa while we absolutely appreciate the constraints covert has put on us we are still mindful of imposing increased financial burden local community to local communities and this is why we would ideally see no increase to rates especially for those in low income homes no to charging for water therefore penalizing those in our city who truly make it a garden city noted changes in the levels of service and support that governance staff provide to boards and our communities and again please keep community funding to previous levels to best support our communities through these difficult times thank you thank you if you're any questions um jake um probably more a question that john or I actually probably almost certainly a question for john appreciating that you touched on gracefield ad that this probably is be fairly unusual to get an ear marking of funding at the stage of the annual plan for something that would be considered a new project would it be possible in the staff response to the board submission just to get a bit of an outline about what the best process would be for the community if they wanted to to really advocate for that yeah I think I'm very familiar with this one too for a lot of the similar reasons but um this was one that was on the plan a number of years an appropriate time to raise it so but um it will be reported back individually because it's right to raise that sorry sam quick okay just really quickly was the board unanimous and its view around abolishing the uniform general charge no no okay thanks thank you thank you so thank you very much for taking the time to come and make a submission and thank you for focusing so very specifically on the kaupapa of your community board thank you so much for having us thank you thank you next is waipuna um horse wall horn
Uh next is nikki aiken from the oak development trust jordan thank you for inviting me to share here today um yes I'm representing oak development trust we work in the rikun community and we're really passionate that you reconsider the decommissioning of foreign swimming pool and your long-term plan we believe it's essential for the well-being of the people who live in this community we see that rickardin as a place of increasing population and diminishing services and we had a bit of a think of what's been happening in our area lately we've seen lots of building going on but we've seen lots of services move squash ways clubs moved 18 months ago the new zealand institute of sport has moved to the central city this year um reway ali language schools moved to ireland this year there was a volunteer library that used to use the premises of the council building with the new rebuild that we had of that that's closed up a record in the war memorial library is also closed and I can name a whole lot few years but there's a whole lot more population coming into our area and we go we don't want to lose a swimming pool it's a really useful asset and um you know it just we just need to keep these things um and also I'm sure you're all aware of the statistics that have come out with recording being the um second most um deprived area in christchurch that was no surprise to me I work with a lot of these people I see these things and I actually looked at the graph that was in the star paper on april the 22nd and I looked at the numbers and I'm sure you're all aware that graph goes nine to 10 is the highest level I looked at the numbers for seven to eight of the three areas and rickett and if you put those two numbers together reckon is actually 64 deprived now that's really really high that's two and three people and I just go you want to take another thing from this area please reconsider the pool for their health and well-being you know it's great to be able to get out and exercise locally these people don't have lots of resources they can't necessarily jump in their car and go to another suburb bus fares can be very expensive it's also time-wise very costly if you have to go on a bus because often it's not direct and just really feel that yeah can we not just save this resource um you know as I look and I hear a lot of people say the only thing sometimes that we can do and wreck it is go to that wonderful big mall and it's great it's a great asset but we need more than a mall to keep rickett alive so yeah thank you um questions uh anne thank you robin um in your four years that you've been there what have you noticed what what is the um in terms of the use of the pool what communities are using it mostly do you see um there's um a lot of school children use the pool to swim and I just kind of wonder whether some of those families would give their kids private lessons so there's that I know there's a small muslim community that use it and they love it because it is a bit smaller and it's it's private you know some of the bigger pools they're wonderful but they don't have that privacy so yeah they're two groups I'm really aware of and of course there's a great swim club there and they they do great things they've got some wonderful new zealand representative swimmers most of the community walk there to the pool do you notice yes there's a lot of people who walk around the wrecking community definitely yep yeah uh yani thank you for your submission as someone who fought to retain the foreign haul I just wondered if you've seen how much use that's had as well uh no sorry I can't um talk to that okay but there's like a sports club like the whole complex is run by the whole sports um it's run slightly differently like it's all on the same premises but I think the pool is on ministry of education land and the sports centre's different right yeah okay but um just in terms of the metro sports do you do I mean do you think it's too far away for people to use and do you think we need we need to kind of think about how we enable I guess people given that it's you know a really expensive building um look at programs to also enable people from places like ricketton to go to get there that could be an option I just know that the people I talk to that go are too far too hard they really just it is sometimes it's just the basic survivals of getting food on the table getting your kids to school um dealing with with stuff that happens and it's just a step too far to ask them to go to find out how did I get on the bus to go there they wouldn't walk it's too I'm passionate about it and there's lot of migrants in the community you know that's a challenge for them that they're often here for a short time sometimes it's study and so they learn their own community but then to have to learn where things are in another community they don't even know sometimes that these resources are around and it's lovely just about to talk to them and help them to see look did you know this is here this is here this is here and it's local and it's easy to get to thank you very much well I think we've got a number of submissions on on saturday as well in relation to this issue so thank you very much the next is david
Or curry hunter I'm not curry thank you sorry carrie you're welcome thank you thank you for being here is my home we're in a climate crisis a biodiversity crisis and an inequality crisis and climate change is already killing hundreds of thousands of people with hunger disease heat exposure etc and according to oxfam a just response means that new zealand's emissions would be cut by at least 80 by 2020 I agree with them that means changing how we do almost everything that's not easy if no one takes robot responsibility it won't get done this draft long-term plan has lots of stuff in it that's really good but it's not yet the plan we need because the council can't leave it up to central government or to business or to individuals or to some later long-term plan to do this job you'll need more resources and you need to work with central and regional government but the job needs to be done and what we need is a picture of a zero emissions environmentally and socially sustainable future that uses no fossil fuels or synthetic fertilizers that emits far less methane and that does not rely on emissions beyond our borders a picture that shows how we will eat drink clean water have roofs overhead learn work and connect with each other we don't need and can't afford economic growth we need to reorient what is the work that will need to be done for our well-being who will do it where will they live how will they travel how can people get supplies how will people connect with their communities how will we manage retreat in a low emissions way how will we include everyone we need these in an integrated plan I haven't_''_142.319 I have responded to the climate change strategy but there's a whole lot of money decisions that need to be made in the long term plan um and no decisions were made without taking this into account we've seen leaders act swiftly and boldly in a crisis this may be our last opportunity to act this the decisions that are made this year may be the last below 1.5 degrees c if the solutions don't meet everyone's needs equitably then destructive social conflict will likely make solutions harder or impossible I ask you as councillors to throw all your weight to this biggest ever challenge to totoko my compatriot griez I want you to act as though our house is on fire because it is and that's the big picture but I also had some a little more detail as well that I wanted to say when gathering revenue it must come from those who can most afford it transport it's an emergency we should be able to get safe fully connected cycle routes connecting most of christchurch within a year or so if we do it using fast temporary means we know about road cones we know about temporary fencing just get it done fast that would be the quickest way to get people out of their cars and onto bicycles and skateboards and everything and if it's a if it gets a few people out of their cars that'll make it more convenient and more attractive to bicycle and to wind you up as I did with greg as well so but I mean a number of people have made the same um point and uh I think we're hearing it very loud and clear around the like the ferry road um model that has been developed as a way of transforming streetscapes to get us um moving in a quicker direction what I meant was actually everywhere not just a few routes that's what I'm every second street there's a lot of people a lot of people are saying we can do more if we do less of the type because we've got a more of a transitional nature but it enables more to go on yeah so thank you very much for your submission much appreciated
Thank you um the next one is uh stephen howard keep our assets canterbury welcome hello me my name is stephen howard with me is john minto we're from kawakara is a mix of individuals and groups committed to the retention of assets in public hands the very opposite of the neoliberal drive to privatize and diminish public goods a major concern is that the privatization of public and common goods is a threat to democracy and generally efficient economics it's very pleasing to see in the note that the um council sent that everyone's read all the submissions which is contrary to the recent report in the press by one of one quoted one counsellor saying he doesn't bother to read all the submissions a few years ago we were confronted by with a cameron report the one point it made that made any sense was that the strategies of the assets in cchl should be more closely aligned with the council's aspirations and so the council needs to be much more directly involved with those assets we keep seeing problems in other cities dunedin and auckland have all faced problems the council needs to take the reins and run with it directly um julian jentez said in a private conversation that she thought they'd change the operating model for public transport and the ministry but they obviously haven't but it's time for the council and he can't work together to make that change the council also needs to have more direct control of the airport assets and the port the terrace fiasco and the safety problems at the ports both ours and auckland illustrate a strong case for more direct public control it's clear that the biggest challenge facing our city and in fact the globe is the changes coming from climate change coba is nothing compared so it's very important that the council has more direct control of both assets and of the public service thank you john's going to say okay for words now look I wanted to draw your attention to two things first one is on page three of our submission where there's a little graph there and this is a major obstacle to having free public transport here in christchurch we've just come from a meeting with with ecan where we were talking about this issue and I want to make sure that councillors really understand this little graph here so it's comparing auckland and canterbury in terms of the the amount of gov sorry the in terms of how the um the split is between uh public transport and state highways in terms of government funding right so in auckland for example auckland is the black bars so in auckland public transport um per capita is funded at almost 1300 whereas the state highway improvements is down at um less than just a bit less than 600 dollars in other words there's a two to one bias in favor of public transport in auckland but if you look at the canterbury graph that's the red bars for public transport we've got less than 300 dollars per capita whereas for state highway improvements it's way up at nine nine hundred dollars per capita in other words we've got a three to one split is this that the the council with ecan need to be renegotiating with with wakakotahi the split in terms of public transport and regional roads funding if we had the if christchurch had the auckland split we could be a we would have the ability to have free public transport right across the the region from um from rangiora down to littleton out to darfield out to ralliston that whole area free public transport with enough investment to provide low emissions electric buses I mean china's got 800 000 electric buses I think we've got one in christchurch maybe we need a couple of hundred of those so we're not talking about old diesel buses chugging around the streets we're talking about a real investment and and high quality public transport fifty three our greenhouse gas emissions in christchurch city is is from transport we could make a huge dent in that with free public transport so I hope that graph is um is is shows us the way we can do it without having increases in rates for taxes and the last point is the charging for excess water use we've put an oia request in for information which would help which would tease out the impact this would have on low income families in christchurch we haven't had the results of that back despite it being over a month um and we're hoping that so we when we receive that we will um we'll send that around councillors but um it seems to me that the information isn't there to for the council to say no this is not going to have any significant impact um the if you read our submission we're talking about you know christchurch is a garden city we've invested quite a bit of that in terms of their city's image I think it would be what would be the economic impact here if christchurch became known as the desert city rather than the rather than the garden city because the whole east coast with climate change is going to have a lot less rainfall and um that shouldn't the council shouldn't be putting the burden of that onto people's come to the end of the time so thank you for your contribution next is
Uh ross mcfarlane from the hawthorne river rating district liaison committee good evening good evening uh thanks for having us so late you must have been done something terribly long to keep to be kept in this lake all right we don't mind um I take the submission as read uh and tonight I'm going to focus on a few words fair unfair equitable inequitable service non-serviced amenity and accessibility the horse's river rating district was sent a 30th of march dated letter received sixth of april to say some pretty massive changes were occurring in the way rates were charged around the whole district which we don't think is fair and equitable but uh we're still in the halls or rating districts because we already pay a rate to ecan um so what's it's seen that we might be paying to rates the reason this rate has been brought in is probably what I'm going to touch on first in the submission I've left two options um and the option one which I think is fair to everybody is to need to bring in this wholesale change when you have got 96.3 rating coverage by value and 97.5 rating coverage by volume that 96 and 97 are serviced areas people have a conduit a connection a pipe or some plumbing to a service you are bringing in a targeted rate to areas that has no service so on that basis if you think that's fair we actually think it's totally inequitable I'm sure you'll hear over the next five days from a lot of rural folk particularly from banks peninsula because they are being punished um there's some pretty big increases out there and based on their capital value we had a great deal of uh difficulty getting communication with staff um we sort of saw this coming in your draft report of march 4th but we didn't have the physical area maps of where you were going to bring this global district land drainage rate to we asked for a meeting on the 14th of march we finally got a meeting on the 14th of april four days before submissions closed speaking with and argue you are paying the rate twice you are wasting your time we were told essentially they are saying this is about accessibility and amenity everybody in the city benefits by the land drainage rate we are told however in the halls writing district and this is the analogy I put in the submission you exit the city you go into selwan you go down state highway 75 you head to acaroa you go back out of selwyn and you go back in to christchurch we pay the rate for that area we give you that amenity and that accessibility down that corridor is it fear that we should pay that rate twice we say no this really is a shock to everybody and and if you start to use that analogy what's next will our river rating districts start to charge you for opening like elsmere because that's something you don't pay for presently but it is of benefit to the city to discharge the water that comes from the upper hallswood river catchment area so you're really going into a line in an year comes from new brighton will charge horsewool for that it's it's that sort of scenario and to take it back to the farming community and charge them the last thing you want to be doing to the farming community is imposing in a rate on them that will see them stop doing some of the very basic work that they do because it's in their nature in their best interest if the attractors going down the road to clear a drain while they go past it they're not going to ring and expect it done by city services or whatever ever so it's just a totally unfair application and I ask you to look at option one of our submission and if you don't and that's not palatable to you please ensure that you adopt option two which is essentially um just or not including the hallsville district so that's really um the five minutes really gone I've got nine seconds for questions six I've got you've written here twice though but no it's okay sorry did submission yes was that five minutes or no yeah I mean flies long doesn't it no that yeah but there's a there's there's a second block of three minutes for your personal submission yes um I'll not touch on the land drainage rate and my personal submission I think I've just covered that um take you back to um june 25th 2019. um city council made a resolution to do a full rates review we've been expecting this for a while we would have thought that that would have engaged with the community and maybe looked at some of those errand rates and I'm going to bring to your attention the one that causes probably the most upset and that's the remote rural rebate where it applies 25 discount to the general rate this is a subjective rate you've heard it before it is inequitably applied uh our last meeting with council senior finance staff basically said to us if you know of any people that this rate should apply to could you ring us so we can increase your the erection or of a shed for example or the removal of stock or the arrival of stock it is just silly policy commercial policy and the 67 premium is applied by the dixtric plan zoning if you did the same to the rural remote rebate you would get the same outcome you would get black and white you either pay it or you don't staff it's obvious spend a lot of time on google looking down looking up driveways and finding out what's changed in areas it really is um it's bad policy and staff shouldn't have to act on bad policy I don't know what was brought to you on that but my submission mentions where you're now changing um a property if it's greater than 20 hectares and it has a connection past it to the sewer you now not charging at a residential rate I'd suggest to you that you want to really look at that and if that property is able to be subdivided why would you give that property a 25 reduction in their holding be bringing and coming into the land market and made into housing that's not a good piece on that so there's other points in my personal submission that I take is read but I'll touch on land sales the policy of using the ltp to get the community to bring to you reasons or not for holding onto properties is the wrong approach more so in our hallsville area because we are balancing development gifted reserves against ones that we want to hold on to and I mentioned specifically 46 nichols road it was in the trance of um odata community housing gifts as the balance for what they lost through their housing insurance portfolio we were told it was gifted to otaki community housing trust in the meantime the energy of the place into looking for a location has been lost and their funding also has been lost through national property management changes um we had a group of people who were really driven towards getting a new place into if we had picked up that land when it was available it would be built done with the community on each and eve one of those comes back to the cart club also you're selling land around a motorsport facility you're funding the go-kart club to move to another facility again so you need to have a look at the holistic approach there I touched also on the um transfer station that smelly place over and you've got land that you own out in miners road now miners road is the dirtiest dustiest holiest piece of ground you can imagine its closest neighbor is the department of corrections or their pig farm that is the place for smelling facilities to me you should have moved it out there my personal point of view anyway I've had my three minutes haven't I you have any more questions thank you very very much ross that's much appreciated oh there was one question sorry that's time so thank you very much thank you george forbes
Uh the next one is uh david david hibbleth weight um eden project uh and I think you're zooming in yet so we've got you zooming in so far away hello can you hear me all right yeah yes I can hear you perfectly uh and thank you and I can introduce my colleague david harland who's also on zoom he's the ceo of eden projects international and he'll be speaking on our behalf and I'm here to join in any questions you may have well um thank you and greetings from late night in the uk nice to see you again mayor and uh and everyone there and thank you for this uh opportunity I i think um we've obviously uh put in uh our plan uh uh sorry we've contributed to your plan rather and I suppose what we're here to say is uh we are very uh excited um to have an opportunity to work in christchurch uh in new zealand uh on a project that will be one of the sisterhood of projects that would that uh a number of different places across the world um linking them all together and I think this is a fascinating opportunity because here we are you looking at a ten year plan precisely in the decade where humanity really does need to look at some very serious issues we were delighted to see that climate change featured um loud and proud within your um plan so we are still here we've uh we've been working through our own plans we really do want to build in project um for new zealand in christchurch it's going to be hard there's no doubt it's taken eight years to get to this point um but I think the key point for us is that this long-term plan should uh enable us to do everything possible in to increase its odds of uh success its chances of success I think um probably two or three specific points um we're we've been really pleased with the um support that we've had thus far from the council and other bodies including nzte and I think what we're seek further support and partnership working with the council and we would like to engage both with uh the co-governance model that's being proposed and directly with uh with ewe as well um key for us in a project like this is and it's critical for any project of the scale that we're talking about would be uh the the land to tenure and the land security uh and we have a license that will expire uh at some point towards the end of this year and uh having security over the land is is gonna be essential because that allows you then um to sit to seek and secure uh the funding necessary to do a project of of this scale um uh I think alongside that um it's no surprise when you were talking about the avon uh uh corridor here in the red zone land um and uh it would be fair to know that's not the easiest place to do a project like this we're well aware of that you're well aware of that I think there are um and references made to those within the with the plan uh and of course this includes things like stock banks and uh wastewater treatment systems services and and so forth but they will be an important part of any plan whether ours goes ahead or or not those will still be required and then the final element that I was going to must mention is clearly funding is going to be key as I mentioned land is going to be be part uh of uh of securing that and getting certainty over over the land but we have always been clear that this is a public private and philanthropic uh endeavor and we were really delighted to see that there's a commitment to looking at innovative um ways of building financial resilience together innovative ways of having partnership working along with the council and other and other partners and we're looking forward to engaging on those um further so I'm sorry to be a bit stuttering it's very late in the uk so um but uh and I don't need a timer counting me down all I had um from here um thank you look thank you very much and and we do appreciate you um staying up late at night in order to uh communicate with us in our time frame um did anyone have any questions that they'd like to sarah just on the um the the time frames that you would like to be moving towards at the moment sure so um we've just along with colleagues in the uh and some trustees that we have locally there and with david who's also on screen we've just completed a feasibility uh study it says the project is feasible and from from all the aspects that we expect we're now moving forward uh you know over the course of the of the next year we need to lock down uh the designs and and get some certainty over those key points so the first one is the land this year if we can secure that then everything else I think can then fall into place thereafter in terms of the eventual opening I i think you'd be much look thank you and uh thank you for taking the time to make a submission and um a pleasure we're all very optimistic thank you great thank you um the next one is stephen howard keep
Uh greg clydesdale greg greg greg sit how's that the timing awesome I don't think I've ever seen someone turn up just at good evening and welcome hello I've got a powerpoint that um I think someone's meant to be loading up and I think it's going to come off here if we go she's probably just doing it as we speak yep people are doing things I saw it for a moment here we go it's on its way good one yep it's good thank you whoever is doing that I hear the voice okay I've got three minutes so I suppose I better get straight into it correct yeah um my expertise is economic uh I'm an economist expert my expertise economic growth but I'm different to other economists and that I draw a lot on psychology and history and that includes you can see my latest book which is coming out later this year is on policies for economic growth I'm interested in why policies fail you'll see a book there on human efficient decision making we like to think that we're rational but our ideologies can really restrict the way we perceive information um we often follow paradigms very strongly um we're not as rational as we think we are um and we're at our week is when we really strongly believe in an ideology looking at the transport policies um and climate change we want to reduce oil use that's our goal we want to reduce oil use so the first thing I did is I contacted the little from port company to see what's happening with oil consumption and I can I ask for 2013 and 2019 and our oil consumption hasn't gone down in fact it's increased by 11.13 in that six years of course our population had grown on that time so I thought well let's take into account per capita basis and even that on a per capita basis you know the our city's contribution to climate change has actually increased it hasn't been reduced it's increased so I thought well what about number of cars to stop cars from going into the city use buses and bikes and our car use has almost doubled in six years and that's not a per capita basis you'll see you know 0.485 cars per person to 0.7 when I try to look you know these these are broad figures but when I'm trying to look at evidence that this council's policies fighting climate change have worked you actually begin to wonder maybe if council's policies have actually been counterproductive you know if a business gets eighty percent of its if of its custom by car even if you raise that twenty percent to twenty five percent they're not going to favor bikes and buses they're going to favor their car passengers and by making it hard for cars to travel and park in the city planners thought they were discouraging cars from driving into the city in reality the discouraging business from returning to the city which made it hard for that bus hub and spoke system to work and so businesses remain dispersed and disperse or business favors cars and the use of cars and oil instead of just instead of discouraging cars into the cbd we should have been encouraging them because with every car that comes to the city there's also a person busting there's also it's easier for a person to bike policies that seek to return us to the days of bicycles and buses we need to be forward looking buses can't compete with cars in terms of cap time carrying load routes and I think the council has failed because it hasn't been getting inside of the head of business people and I wonder if in some extent they've been ignoring them we now have wide empty footpaths fewer businesses in town fewer customers fewer pedestrians empty bike racks everywhere very wide footpaths empty businesses struggling for customers empty cycle racks everywhere what's what's the I think it's time we need to move away from this climate change frenzy and it's time for reason it's time for reason look at the goals instead of reducing use of oil the city has increased it even it has dramatically increased bus and passenger goals of 20 million a year they've got 11 million 17 million free earthquake the city remains unbuilt the city has failed because of the ideology it's based on and I think you guys need to take a move back to the basis rethink the assumptions on which you're making decisions and take another breath before you commit more money to policies based on buses and bikes thank you that's the perfect timing we'll leave it at that and thank you very much thank you thank you greg good morning thank you sorry
Appreciate it um andrew evans ae architects morning morning hello I'm andrew evans I'm an architect who specializes in multi-unit residential complexes um central city buildings as well but never mind about that in discussion at a pre-app meeting with council staff they suggested the issue be brought up the submission is that is to recommend that the council creates and adopts a formal policy to provide a partial rates rebate for suitable medium and high density residential complexes that get their rubbish removed by private companies not the christchurch city council system this is for fairness and to reduce clutter and problems on both the street for both the street collection and within the complex getting an independent operator such as waste management to remove bins like the larger 660 litre bins on demand saves curb space reduces complaints and the eye saw caused by a boatload of bins both on the street and on the site as well but currently developers are very hesitant as they or the future owner is will face ongoing costs while still paying full rates now since I made the submission and project lead recovery resources resource recovery and a council urban designer josie schroeder the council urban designers are also very keen on this bin issue to be resolved rowan is making headway on a much better system of flexibility for bins and wastes but there's a lot of work to do much consultation and he has some excellent ideas about changing the by-laws which are about 14 years old but it may not be running till around about 2024. um what rolan is talking about sounds like it should solve all the issues that I'm talking about if it can pass the political hurdles upon thinking about it my concern is that perfect will become the enemy of good and that perhaps an interim policy could be created so that three years of opportunity are not lost before the ultimate policy is made uh perhaps something like this and I've emailed a little bit between rowan and I on this firstly it would be foreshadowed to develop some residents that are more flexible policy for refuge is coming what rowan's talking about is different rates smaller sized bin you pay less rates which encourages waste minimisation and also the ability to use big bins and to use private operators um I mean if what he's talking about comes comes to fruition it would be brilliant it would it would you know it would add a lot of flexibility but obviously complexity um what I'm thinking would be say that complexes that would meet the requirements like maybe five units that would be optional and maybe more than eight or all apartments should do it unless they can show a standard bin solution won't create negative effects and then they would be required to use the biggest 660 litre or compactors or whatever communal bins except maybe green waste some flexibility in negotiation should be allowed for example on a corner site where there's lots of road frontage if they did use if they did go for this system and opt out then I would suggest that they that each unit should receive a rates rebate of say a part reduction on the waste minimisation fee of maybe 25 rebates per service a complex used big bins and paid privately for both rubbish and recycling they would get 50 if they just say use rubbish they'd get a 25 if they used all three but still be 50 now this is actually pretty light uh rebate a quick calculation is that it would only cover about 30 percent of the cost of doing the big bin service and then one question would be whether this interim rebate would apply to only to new projects or whether it would apply to all existing buildings and complexes now obviously this would be a political decision balancing the extra cost that you wouldn't be getting in rates versus fairness I mean personally I'd go with fairness myself so that's that's all thank you thank you it's really good to have a generic submission on the subject and I'm really pleased that you talk to staff about some alternative ways of resolving it because um that will give us a bit of a stare into what we might be able to do I should say that I'm an the large complex across the road uses its own system so it's been very helpful to have this submission yeah is it anyone quickly yep aaron I'm just going to ask if that submission could go straight to our um uh well we're currently reviewing our rubbish bin policy so this should just go straight over there to feed into it yeah but this should still feed in our decision-making we will get some advice on this um submission as we are with a number of the submissions as they come through so that will help us decide what to do when we come to the decision making so yeah thank you thank you very much much appreciate it thank you cheers
Um george forbes good evening hi good evening lucky last I think yep thank you very much for the opportunity to make this short verbal submission I oppose the proposed plan for an excess residential water supply charge otahi christchurch is new zealand's garden city flourishing gardens and green spaces are a critical component of a healthy community and environment green spaces including those that are residential give the garden city its title I believe that council's policies should proactively encourage more green spaces and logically that means active sensible water use we have here a uniquely water-rich city and whether for ourselves or for the green environment around us our residential use of water here is generally good use I am concerned about the presentation and use of statistics by council in the long term plan consultation document there is a bias towards this proposal and a risk that the bias unreasonably and unfairly skews the proposal information this largely flat and water-rich city is quite different in many substantial ways to cities such as auckland wellington and dunedin we are hugely fortunate in that regard and by others who be a little practical resemblance to this city I've set out some specific examples in my written submission this proposed new charge as formulated appears in reality to be a gardens and families tax in this garden city I strongly believe that this proposal risks residents becoming hesitant about planning developing and maintaining gardens of the city and additionally any household with 2.8.2.8 people or more using average quantities of water each per day will come under the proposed taxation regime it's not encouraging of a city that wants families to be a vibrant part of its growing community my submission is that this new gardens and families tax would only be another unfair tragedy for the people and for the environment of this great garden city thanks very much thank you um yeah thank you for the all of that um questions sam um thank you george for coming and can you just maybe touch on the you talk about the data and the presentation uh in the ltp document that was potentially biased or you know skewing one way what did you mean comes from water new zealand which is a different and independent body there's been a pick and mix of the use of that data and in addition what I really mean by that is some of the presentational figures are done on almost apples and apples comparison as if christchurch had the same elements to it than any other city but I don't think you can compare christchurch on an apples and apples basis for somewhere like auckland which has a water supply shortage when we are in fact a water-rich city it's the infrastructure that causes us the issue rather than their supply yeah it is about the emphasis we're not talking about charging for water we're using it as a but it's only the water that is that goes through our we're charging for the infrastructure use not for the water itself well you will be charging iron stand for the use of water if you use more than the yes so the volumetric charging is is designed to pick up this um excessive use of infrastructure yeah and and that point out that we need to really reflect on the quality of the input data yes the data that we're contemplating if we're going to compare apples with apples rather than what you're suggesting equals with peers you're right the use of the word excessive is entirely subjective and I will concur with you the data does need to be re-examined yeah and we will examine the data um and but we also do need to think about the infrastructure and you've suggested that there's another way of addressing that so um specifically well I I've I've asked that this that you as a council look at other options other than mere taxation yeah yeah all right thank you very much that was a good note to end on thank you very much all right thank you um everyone and I will adjourn this meeting until
Nice thank you thank you alex eason who is the trustee for the mount pleasant international trust good morning thank you for the opportunity of uh addressing you all this morning um takamatua is the bay just before akaroa and it is one of the pearls in the region it is becoming more and more popular the amount of housing that's actually increasing in the area is substantial nothing has been done over the last years it's very popular for all kinds of water recreation beach goers and particularly an access entrance they go over to a place called sandy bay which is only accessible by boat or some kind of craft you could swim over there but I haven't seen many people doing that but the real issue is the amount of parking it's also used by um school groups especially those that go over and you have a camp at the old school grounds school building up on the main road and they come down they've got a whole fleet of piccolo boats that they come down and sail but when I see from from town parents and grandparents and such there's actually not much room there so it's one of those areas I think we should um it needs to be seriously looked at because it is with boats and trailers and people parking there it's relatively unsafe on those high days um so what I'm suggesting is do I can I play with that if you move to yeah those are those things I've just been talking about if you go to the next slide that's the point the top left where it sticks out there there's a big tree just to the left of that little promontory there that's where the ramp is and just the side of that there is a hole there's there's I think about eight boat parks for boats and trailers go to the next slide please um what I'm suggesting either that that area to the right out into the sea is used but there's also quite a large land reserve which is road reserve on the left side of their road there the council is an expert at building retaining walls it would take a reasonable retaining wall to keep that house safe there but it's an area that I think we could should consider working with increasing that area and making it safer I think the demand for the area will just continue as it's seen as one of those delightful recreational spots for the city and also because of the increase in local residents in the area thank you I think the the one on the coastline would come up against the the coastal marine environment and the rma so I don't I don't I don't think that's a um a goal but you you have raised a challenging issue you're not the first person to raise this it was raised in a previous plan is that am I remembering that right no no no no it was about parking specifically at um this bay I was at the tra meeting the other day they said they'd raise it about 10 years ago as far as I can work out well maybe first ltp yeah I'm pulling you might have covered this is it basically for boat launching there or do people just park there to swim well there's a lot of people the other day there was a an art group that came down and were you know doing various things but then people come down and just sit on the beach and things like that there's people fishing off the wharf a lot of people come in canoeing right so it's not just to launch your boat no no no no thank you right there any other questions look thank you very much very much much appreciated
Um priscilla's not here yet so richard jack welcome thank you so I'm richard and I live in the very organized neighborhood at the top of huntsbury hill it's been exploded from the fiber rollout I understand you might have heard from some of my neighbors already today you're number three three oh gosh sorry I hope my jokes are better um so enable maintain that we're 350 meters away from the nearest uh from the fiber roll out but we're not you know I went past it on my way to work this morning and I got out of my car and I thought well I reckon I could throw a rock between the end of westview terrace and the nearest fiber connected property um I didn't try and throw a rock because I thought it might genuinely have been threatening you know it's really quite close maybe maybe 50 meters 60 meters something like that it's not a big gap um it's quite hard not to be discouraged by the fact that enable want 36 grand to connect on the emery plains like uh rotherham and um waiau there neighborhoods about the size of us but um they're miles away from anywhere they can get connected these places can get connected but we can't um we're not a rural subdivision you know we're in the residential city zone we I can see this building from my front door it's we're not we're not we're not rural properties uh and there's one residential zoned property that has not been developed that we have the misfortune to be on the other side of and for some reason this means that we've been excluded so this has a couple of issues the first one is really one of one of equity we're actually being asked to pay for this twice we've already paid for it once through our rates and taxes and it's not really very reasonable to ask us to pay for it again the second issue is that it doesn't really align with the naval statement of intent or christchurch city council's strategic goals't provide for a resilient city this doesn't enable economic prosperity it's just a limit on us and we know our community well we're we're a group of people that some of us work from home some of us are trying to run businesses some of us are distance learners some of us haven't seen our families in 12 months except through a computer screen and we're trying to do all of this over fixed wireless or or the agent copper network this just isn't viable into the future so what we'd like to do is uh see you guys put some pressure on enable um for them to pay for this out of discretionary funding or pay for it directly maybe the 13 million dollars they've just paid you guys the dividend could be helpful here so I guess I'll finish by asking the question that um enables been putting up on billboards which is 2.7 million kiwis are connected to fiber what are you waiting for thank you very much and uh I mean obviously we've we yours is not the only area and research that is um that is cut off from that um from that um lincoln so however it's probably the only one that's within 50 to 100 meters yeah oh no no we'll ask your neighbour um if he has um I'm sure there are others and we understand there's a line there's got to be a line but there and so the question that you're asking us is to find some resources within the ltp to bridge that line so yeah well our question is why does the line not real will not align with the residential zone you know we're but it's not it's not for now so um but I will we will as a council uh take on board your submission and um see what we can do with that yeah thank you thank you
Um is it sue carbines um and I just noticed um yeah so five minutes these are five minute presentations from the residence association I'm meg rollston and this is sue carbines from the south shore residents association thank you for giving us uh type the opportunity to speak to our submission the south shore residents association is an incorporated society funded in 1947 and we represent the interests of nearly 500 households in south shore today we're only going to speak to our main concern in our written submission as you know we've been coming to council for the last several years asking for our easter edge that was badly damaged in the earthquake sequence to be repaired we've worked collaboratively with council to achieve a solution that was ultimately co-designed by jacobs and gary tarr of osal an expert appointed by council to assist the community by the community's interests in the solution design this solution was mandated by the council resolution in 2019 titled cncl 2019 00196 with the solution being presented to council and accepted in november 2020 and our residents for this long-awaited earthquake repair to be implemented and we fully support the funding allocated under the long-term plan including capital spend items five nine oh four five one six six six one six one five and six two five four nine I'm going to interview and just say you don't need to read out all of the detail okay because we've read the submission but but but just the passion right well we fully support that funding so um and one of our uh issues is that while projects within the long term plan have been called flood and erosion protection we just want to make sure that it's clear that these projects are earthquake repairs returning our community to pre-earthquake levels of protection the implementation of this earthquake rule repair will address a major community well-being concern and alleviate stress within our community we look forward to seeing the work commence and we want to thank the council staff and community board who continue to work with us on this issue and we'll be back next year to ensure funding flows through to sue um in your submission you're also asking for allocation in the long term plan for the reinstatement of the two-way section of new brighton road I don't know if you know that the star staff came out on monday to brief the community board and the issue with that and that's about the new pages road have you been updated on that no okay I can tell you that um the funding for that is around in the nature of uh 17 to 20 million dollars so that's a little bit of a an issue but it is being considered oh that's encouraging great yeah because you mentioned that there and the evacuation route you also mentioned in in your submission that was addressed quite thoroughly and uh there are plans afoot for that too as part of the pages great we wanted to support our neighbours on that so that's fantastic yeah I think that there are big big issues associated with that area of road which um floods from below as well as from alongside so it's a very challenging convinced that it needs to be located where it is no it may not be but it it's yes as long as there's some it needs to be it needs to be fully integrated into the into what is the otakuro avon river corridor and the pages road um inch bridge which is essentially the entrance into into new brighton from the from the west so I mean there's there's a lot of work to do in this area I know this area very well I remember walking across that bridge on the 22nd of february 2011. um and uh it's an area that I'm yeah well that's one of the concerns isn't it the bridges are out then you need the roots yeah and look in terms of evacuation only communities know how to uh how to evacuate and and the resilience planning um process the all of the work that's going on in terms of adaptation planning over time the communities have got to really own that um I i was furious when I basically saw people stuck on that if there had been a tsunami actually heading our way that would have been the worst place to be um you know sort of rather than on top of the land sand dunes probably would have been safer so there's a lot of work to be done but you've you've raised really significant issues and um I hope you come back to say thank you I mean that would be fabulous thank you as a not a not a gratitude thank you man I understand thank you yeah yeah well keep that funding flowing and will we think excellent no thank you very much thank you
Uh georgina bevin welcome good evening thank you all for having me here tonight um I have am speaking on behalf of belfast netball club um we've submitted in the long term plan to have our courts redone we're a fairly big club last year I believe we had around 25 teams so one of the biggest um clubs in the south island let alone just here in christchurch and having those home courts well maintained and in good condition is really important for us as a club something that makes us different from a lot of other clubs in christchurch is that we are able to practice and train in our own local area so we have girls who come all the way out from rangiora and then others that come towards pepperdine and the city centre to come play with us and being able to train in belfast rather down at hagley just makes it a lot easier I know for myself having just to travel 10 minutes out to belfast versus into town through traffic to get to haggle it smells pocket heavily that sucks able to use these courts is just really important to us um so I just wanted to outline that I've been with belfast for six years now our courts have just continued to deteriorate as far as I'm aware in the past 20 years they haven't been maintained um we can't use sections of the courts because they as soon as we get a frost they will remain wet they will never dry out um there's random markings from all sorts of other sports which makes it really hard to play on especially when you're a young girl trying to learn the sport they get very confused I know I coach it's taken a lot of time to figure out where the lines are sometimes there's the holes for the tennis um knits which have actually sunk into the ground and they do collect water over the season so it makes it very slippery when we're trying to train nipple is a very like injury-heavy sport it's really heavy on your knees your ankles all your joints and just that not well maintained is just added to injury um back in 2018 I'm firing at trials so about two years before sorry two months before the season started and a girl actually I believe she told her acl right in front of me as I was umpiring and that's I think yeah it's a very hard injury to recover by and I don't think she's actually really been able to return to nepal since um and yeah that was quite scary having someone yeah break yeah their acl right in front of you um yeah I just wanted to stress that belfast nipple club it's a really great club they serve a large area and it's really important to our community that we keep these courts we keep these courts in good condition so that we are able to use them in our future generation our kids and everyone else that comes are able to use these courts um they have such a great social aspect and just really provide for a large amount of people and we just yeah really want these play and support ourselves as a club yeah and the club have presented to our community board even though you're across the road from out of our boundary half your people live in our area um and it was a good presentation my question would be have you seen a worse toilet in the entire country than the one at your club just for anyone who's thinking of not um it's horrendous um a girl I actually coached before I came here today and a girl wanted to use them and um I started with another coach and she was like be aware they are really bad and she went in and she was like oh they're fine and lifted up the toilet seat and I think it was filled to the brim of yeah and there was lots of lots lots of noise of disgust coming out of that 12 year old's mouth so yeah I i think the last time I used them was about again two years prior back or three years private probably 2018 and yeah I vowed never go back last time until those are redone that I will be stepping back in there because they are absolutely disgusting if you're missing any players this season they're possibly still in there yes make sure to check when I go back down yeah well your community board's already submitted on it too so um we're very very well aware of the issue but thanks for exciting the graphic a majority that none of us are now gonna take out there at any time thank you very much it's really important club level um what you do in the community it's amazing and thank you for being a coach too really much appreciated so thanks for coming all good thank you everyone thank you greg clydesdale
Thank you the uh next one is is it mike slay from sumner village park hi good morning you wish up here good morning morning councillors um council staff uh yeah thank you for the opportunity to talk briefly to our submission I think just following on from the previous mission what's interesting about this is some after the earthquakes built a temporary village green so it's an even temporary urban space and I think everyone was really surprised about the amount of use it got and that actually put in the right place and of the right size I think probably every community has the ability to use these spaces really well I mean it provided a really important way for people who'd lost their houses or lost their jobs and things or children that were you know upsetting you know affected in quite a long-term way for them all to reconnect and be in one place so I think the idea of the practicing is a brilliant idea and we had it it worked and that's there's been a gap since because the summer community centre um and we have had a temporary skate park which has been really good for um but we know luckily that is going to be replaced so that's a real step forward but there are people I suppose outside the skating community thinking wouldn't it be great if we can also have a village green and restart those those situations and opportunities um and so I mean one of the in that regard uh there has been discussion well there was a site that was chosen that could cope with both the skate park and a village green and that was after a lot of consultation and then there was quite a bit of work put into it and a site sorry a concept design has been developed and it's one that sort of really shares amenities as well so the skate park can be as useful as possible uh but also the village green can be sit alongside it I don't think there's probably no dispute amongst anyone that is not a good idea and in fact that's why the is probably just more about timing and uh and we fully understand the constraints and councils under and they appreciate the uh village skate park getting funding in the near term but we sort of we felt it's a real opportunity to try and do the both at the same time both in terms of potentially saving some money and avoiding limiting disruption but also providing those benefits earlier if possible um yeah so some of the core reasons that we've we'd put forward for seeing if it can be funding can be put forward as one is a the integration of the site so you have drinking fountains shade relaxation for siblings parents and siblings and skaters but also other users from my experience in uh property development and construction it's definitely will save money if you can do it at the same time and it will be less disruptive um there's a strong ongoing demand uh amongst a village amongst the community for this village green and I think probably another key point is that when minister woods was down two years ago from the red zone through to the council she was clearly of the understanding that it was going to be a village green and a skate park and that they both had importance um yeah and there's also probably just a broader issue that many residents supported this uh nathan street site because it could offer these immunities otherwise there may have been other sites proposed um so ready in summary you know we'd be very grateful if the council could consider if there's a way in which the funding could be brought forward for the village green to happen at the same time thank you just I'm just querying you know whether there's some potential for the community playing a more active role in and co-developing the site um I just I i just wondered whether that had been explored and in summer at all um yeah that's a good point all right look I think there is I'm sure something to be discussed again um there have been other things where pet community got involved and you know as the area there's any there's no good reason the community shouldn't try and raise some money and put something towards the towards the green as well I'm not sure how significant that'll be but yeah but I mean I just I just just off the back of the co-design co-creator yeah so the purely the design the community has been heavily involved in that they had a consultation days out in the summer and they had over 100 people attend them including a lot of young people so I think everyone's 100 on board with that side of it um if there's any sort of co-funding I think that's just something we can raise and see if we can in any way contribute as well yani you had your hand up I was just wondering if you thought there was any um uh benefit in looking at the wider area along wakefield I have like the foot like a footpath or the red zone connection into the village green area I mean just I mean I know the site comes out there on anzac's a kind of missing piece of planning that looks at the the red zone and the yeah I think you might be happy to explore it I think one of the challenges would be just that there's that constant tension with car parking and things in those areas right yeah just because uh even the sort of the design and things like the skate park to certain degree was also influenced by not affecting on you know on-road car parking all that sort of thing because there's people wanting to go the library and all those other things but basically doing the doing the village green at the same time as a skate park and maybe looking at footpaths and that red zone would be most cost effective to do it together rather than separate yep people be happy to look at that good well thank you very much thank you very much for taking the time to make a submission it's very very valuable thank you I've got is it sue
We're just talking about decorations of interest when we sort of know people are related to people have uh memberships of community organizations and so um but and I sort of said that tim would sit back from the table the other day but I've kind of reflected on that we're not actually making decisions when we're here but if people just don't engage in the in the um in any discussion um and on that note I do have to um say although I can't oh yes I can see her that jane higgins who's the second submitter is my sister-in-law so I do have to sort of um so I'll simply welcome her without saying anything further on that no then I've got a family member in today as well a brightly colored yes I know yours is yours is more obvious than mine yeah but I'll take away drama you know and people will belong to community groups I've signed up to the um inner city naval icon so you know that there'll be a when they when they come forward so um so on that note could I invite margaret stewart
Thank you and now jane higgins in the city east linwood revitalization project working group uh kyoto thank you for this opportunity I would like to just speak to one aspect of our submission which is requesting a council support for the greening the east plan uh the greening the green east plan came out of a really excellent model of practice in which the revitalization project in the inner city east and the community board worked together with community people and our community board staff and members on a joint working party to look at a real issue in the inner city east which is our lack of green the the working group and the subsequent plan were informed by an extensive community engagement and by the expertise of the community board members and staff so it's very solid plan it was produced in response to the real issue in the inner city east which is that many of our streets are barren of trees and they're very broad streets and long many of our parks are quite small and they're not connected to each other situation in the neighborhood where there's not an easy way to go out and walk about the neighborhood in a pleasant environment there's not an easy way to connect with nature to do exercise particularly in the summer and this is only going to get worse with climate change we know that climate change will exacerbate inequalities and inequities in our city and elsewhere and one of those is going to be around green spaces and green canopies so if we look at elsewhere in the city we see much more development of of environmental pleasant pleasant places so we're arguing that the future doesn't look good for our neighborhood if we can't get some movement on building a tree canopy on those wide streets and making some kind of connection between the the green spaces though there's great potential there also because the neighborhood is right next to as you know uh the the red zone so there's potential for a green corridor through that area into the red zone which would really enhance the area and enhance the city's connectivity the good news is that the the plan that has emerged from the greening the east joint working party is a really excellent plan it's detailed it's I would say it's realistic uh it's something that looks long-term into the future but there are steps that could be taken immediately we would suggest that the the plan is in really good alignment with the principles of the long-term plan particularly around equity geographical equity around the city our well-being for people to be able to exercise quality of the environment and also the reflection of community interests and decision making because of the model of practice that this plan has come out of with the the joint working party between the community board and in the community we also would suggest that it supports the community outcomes of of the council around resilient communities and and a livable city so we note in our submission that there is money put aside for planting and there is money put aside for strategic land acquisition both of those things could be put towards supporting this plan and making inner city is that's very much a livable pleasant place for for people to to be and not only for um the people who've lived there for a long time but also for the newcomers we know there are many newcomers to that area of the city and a lot of them are living in those quite small uh housing complexes with very little access to green space so that's a very strong argument also I suggest for looking to supporting this area in particular and this plan in particular because those kinds of complexes are going to increase and people are going to need some kind of easy access to the environment international spaces for their own well-being and also for the enhancement of the city so I think there's a win-win for everyone in supporting that plan thank you if there's any questions that people have I'm this conflict of interest but I really did want you to touch on the practicing urbanism co-managing public space document that you've attached to the mission because that's not one that the think it's such a valuable contribution to our thinking yep yep it's um well let me give you an example uh the idea of practicing urbanism we have looked at in terms of the streetscaping that's taking place in lima village and one of the ways of doing that streetscaping is to set up some temporary examples of what the streetscape might look like and allow people to engage with those examples so we widen the footpath temporarily or we put in some temporary plantings those kinds of things the idea of practicing urbanism is to bring the community right on board with being able to experience and respond to changes in in the cityscape and so the the example that's given in that attached document has come from research that was done in linwood village by lincoln university researcher and the landscape person wendy hodnot and sue's valance and I really recommend you look even if you just look at some of the steps that they suggest going through to take the community along with kind of council processes the council staff processes around ways of of bringing council staff who are working on those projects and communities together um to be quite realistic about what might be achieved brilliant look thank you very much for that um and uh yeah thank you for putting so much effort into the submission as a whole thank you thank you the
Welcome yes thank you very much um and I'd like to thank you all for the opportunity to speak to you this evening um I do appreciate you have to take a broad view of income and expenditure um to make this the great city that it is but I I'm here tonight just to speak briefly to urge you to keep remembering um some of the little people in the city and there are a couple of points in your long term plan that I'd like to just speak very briefly to one is the proposed closing of the ricketton road bus lounges and the other one is the reduction in opening hours of some of your library our libraries rather and it may appear that there are two dissimilar points but I have the same concern for both and that is retaining a service that improves the life of the more vulnerable sections of christchurch society so for example if you walk into any library there are many many many different sorts of people using libraries at any time but in particular I'm concerned don't have internet access at home the ministry of education found that out last year when it tried to roll out laptops to school to school pupils during the lockdown we need that those young people need those resources internet access to be able to do their homework to be able to make use of the skilled and knowledgeable staff that are there and reducing the library opening hours is not going to help them as regards the ricketton road bus lounges christchurch residents do have to change buses if they're going to move from the central city to some of the more outlying suburbs and you can spend up to half an hour waiting for the your second bus to arrive and the secure warm places which are the lounges in rickard and road I feel are essential for more vulnerable people in our society such as for example the elderly who no longer can drive particularly at night or even in the afternoons because of just how old they are the last thing I'd like to mention very briefly the third point is the reserves about the central city to the surf to the sea um going um along the avon river but there are every suburb and community in christchurch has got reserves playgrounds and so on and I encourage you to actually help us maintain those those reserves in other words we'll supply the labor you supply the plants and the mulching and such fantastic people as employees as heidi wilton but there is a re and that gives us neighbours a reason to get together for short-term friendly projects the long-term effect of course is not only to make sure that community spirit is maintained but we will actually eventually hopefully get the reintroduction of new zealand native birds into our neighborhoods it's sort of like having the pandemic lockdown without the angst of health and economic issues when you're encouraging community kids together so I urge the council to focus on providing us with the help to to help you rather in other words use us that's just music to my ears thank you very much it was a fantastic submission
So um so on that note because I invite margaret stewart to come forward good morning I haven't got an online submission I'm just going to read from my heart as I normally do when I come into these things so hi I'm margaret stewart and I live in saint albans but very near shirley road and I have raised several issues in my submission but I'm only going to talk about one thing today and this is um as stated in my submission I was very disappointed to see that the rebuild of the shirley community center is still not in the long term plan as you are aware the centre was a well-used much-loved facility prior to the earthquakes for the local community and despite the insurance payout the centre has not yet been rebuilt um so the center needs to be rebuilt for local local community to use our part of christchurch has no other local facilities unless we jump into our cars and drive somewhere in my belief is the council is very firmly behind not jumping in your cars anymore and drive across town to other community centres is not the answer to climate change um our community is committed to having our center rebuilt and I'm a member of shirley road central a group set up by local residents to activate 10 shirley road and to make sure our community centre is rebuilt so I'm just going to do a plug for skip day on saturday at shirley road from nine til 11 30 bring along your rubbish and they'll be free sausage sizzle and you can dump your stuff and also sign the petition and meet people in your community so we want to get this community um growing a lot of people aren't even aware there was a community centre before the earthquakes because they've moved in after the earthquakes we have a lot of migrants and refugees from different ethnicities going to religious place to get that sort of thing isn't going to work for them and there's also a lot of infill housing going in so the population in the areas surrounding shelley road is actually going up so dollars have been spent in other areas for community centres that weren't even there before the earthquake so we had insurance on shirley road so I'd like to see the council pulling that money out and putting it back into the community into an area that's currently quite deprived and being let down following the earthquake and we'd like to build that community up again and that's it and I see I've got 14 seconds left 14 seconds has anyone got any questions well I mean the trouble is is that if I if I say yes then we'll go over the the limit but look um I mean your your submission's been very um detailed you've um focused on the on the big issue uh which is I think a very useful contribution to our consideration and there are a number of other submissions that we're going to be hearing on the same subject because we have we have been reading through them and um yeah so you you won't be the first your community board has raised also around the um focus on on getting that uh center replaced so so you won't be the last so thank you very much I am back on the 13th of may when the group submits as well so if you do have any questions save them till then I will see you all then thank you very much thank you and now
Um finn jackson thanks for having me um I think when I counted earlier I think I was the tenth to last person to submit so you're in the home stretch uh it looks like it's been a really long meeting so well done not sitting through it um when I've watched these meetings in the past I've heard people say that they'll take the submission as read so I'm going to say that as well yeah my oral submission now will just focus on why in my submission I asked the council to fund out of existing budgets I'll just say a study into trialing participatory budgeting in christchurch you should have received an additional document with information on the proposal um hopefully it was a thrilling read um yeah so firstly a little bit about participatory budgeting it's a terrible name but it sums it up um it was first conceived of in porto alegre brazil and um yes since then in cities like new york and chicago and paris um it's basically given residents a direct say over of their budgets so it's not going to result in a massive blow out um it would provide a way essentially for people to address small tangible problems with you know small solutions so probably in my mind more quickly and efficiently than if it was um the problems was taking through the um existing processes and it gives them a it would give them a reason to engage with the council on a positive basis um a good example of a problem that could be solved you know under participatory budgeting is the issue which you're going to hear more about I think later during the submissions process about um the extension of fiber broadband up to hunt spring because it's a small relatively small problem in terms of who it affects it's got but it's got a pretty cheap cost and you know they could probably do something in within the participatory budgeting process to address that another example will be hypothetically if residents of uh burwood were faced with a regularly flooding road over a course of a couple of years and trench I should have known that I'm from brighton originally um yeah I'll just say it's introducing it in christchurch is an idea that's been knocking around for a little bit um I know leanne mentioned it after her re-election in 2016 and I think maybe even on their first day as mia in a written piece um refmanji was and it was in the um terms of reference for the finance and performance committee last council term so um yeah the study I've asked for is small cheap and a first step towards a city with uh participatory budgeting where people feel they have genuine power I hope you support it thank you thank you very much and um I mean it's a helpful reminder I think it sort of pushed back on the back burner with covert and everything last year but it's very right and proper that you raise it again today so thank you for that thank you thank you
Uh councillors could take their seats uh we will uh get um underway uh I don't I have apologies for um uh absence during the course of the um hearings today uh from um aaron kuhn and catherine chu uh and um there will be occasions during the course of the hearings that councillors will necessarily need to be absent myself included so uh we will highlight those when they occur but we will also undertake uh to um to watch the watch back this the stream of the submissions that we miss and uh that's quite often when people are making oral submissions they uh there'll be a gem that's not included in the written submission so I think it's important that all councillors commit to hearing all of the submissions that have asked to be heard and of course re read all the all the ones that haven't so um so that's the commitment that we make but um on this occasion just uh two four a short absence this afternoon and I'll move that and seconded by james daniels say aye those opposed say no it's carried and we were just talking about decorations of intro
Um ian delhi welcome hello um following on from john's submission I'm part of the group of na and in our neighborhood as well and at top of huntsbury hill I've been there 15 years I've previously further down huntsbury hill um and lived in a property which um eventually got fiber as well but moved further up the hill like some of them like some of my neighbors um we've always felt very connected to the city of course and one of the things um from the enable people who communications manager who you know effectively turned us down or made us contribute to 36 thousand dollars was that we're outside the main urban area or in a low density area well we're neither of that we're we're in we're quite in the city we have effectively one block of undeveloped land that separates us from the rest of the rest of the huntsbury neighborhood um so feel quite strongly about that that's a misrepresentation from a council effectively a council official um we are only 350 metres is you know virtually nothing um and as as far as I know there's we're up to 39 rate payers in the in the just in our cluster um there's been a couple of more households in the last year or so so and probably more to go and so the map even the maps looking at the maps that were in the submission um that enables to provide well there's more houses that are not showing on that map so their stuff's out of date um so my my recommendation to council is that enable should be directed to complete the planned hunts for extension at no additional cost to the householders and it's and it's not a question as john rightly said it's not really a question of the money that is involved it's actually the principle of you know our interests as ratepayers being put below other other ratepayers in the same area and so I ask that the council consider making enable do it if that's not possible that the council subsidised the cost in some where we can legally direct and able to do to do that it would be like coming here and saying that you live in a particular subdivision and you want your your um electricity wiring to be put underground that's a decision for orion and they have a program of work that they do enable work to a program that was funded by central government based on certain elements and you're not the only part of christchurch that is coming to the council to say can we use the ltp to find a solution on this matter but I think I mean the cases is clearly understood by councillors around the table and we're going to have to work through the issues around how how we respond to the requests that you and others are making thank you very much thank you mark christensen chairperson project
Thank you so I'd now invite the representatives from venues otautahi to the table um and we've got item 20 the direct statement of intent and the half-year performance report um so linda if you've got some introductory remarks and then if the team from venues or tatahi would like to make any comments that would be helpful and then we'll move to questions thank you so we have both a half-year report to 31 december and the draft soi um a half-year performance better than expected fewer events but more catering uh big issue is with fewer events uh the loss of the social benefit that's not monetized so it's less it's not so easy to see the draft soi we are working with venus alta tahi to update the capital uh expenditure requirements for the life of the ltp um we the in the current draft the orange theory stadium funding is shown separately and will be reported against separately in the quarterly reports the assumptions on the financials are that the borders international board is open in the 22 23 of volatility due to the uncertainty uh in that of events and what how the how the covert restrictions might track in future I just wanted to remind you that um venusaur he faces high fixed costs that are uncontrollable relating to the town hall and the christchurch arena and finally that there are no samurai operating costs or revenues reflected in the soi that information is not known at this stage that's my rundown all right thank you is there any commentary from the team from venues of tatahi this is the second time we've seen you this week of course we had the benefits of the workshop earlier in the week which allowed this item to come onto the agenda so thank you all right all good thank you and look um probably similarly to christchurch she said thank you for your time on tuesday uh it's been really helpful to continue to have that discussion together and we obviously have some revisions and to make to our draft persona as a result um we also probably have note by way of the half year impacts of that you can see some of the changes that we have made to the business particularly by way of reduced operating costs and the change to local procurement that that is genuinely having an impact uh commercially for the for the organisation so that's that is a real positive noting that obviously the social and cultural impacts of events in the city has not been as great given the reduced number of events and uh just of note with regard to cmua the the um discussion we had kind of in the last couple of days by way of any assumptions that could be made in ltps etc could be baseline what's in the investment case but as a placeholder because obviously we at the moment are working through quite a detailed analysis and particularly dovetailing into the detailed concept design at the moment and just establishing how those things will actually translate into the operating model for the cmua but thank you so looking at the half-year performance report the fact that in the current environment um 41 events cancelled you've managed to exceed also noting some of the changes that you've made to the operating model bringing catering in-house and obviously a strong focus on food and beverage performance and flexibility around staffing levels I'm guessing that they're all things that have played into that space of um being able to exceed budget in that very constrained and uncertain environment yeah so we've really uh and we're forced really into at the end of june last year and we downsized by around 60 uh and really changed from quite a fixed uh resourcing model to quite a variable resourcing model so we have a core skeleton staff and we can flex as we need to with a more casual workforce and that will remain albeit as we get more into business as usual there will need to be the ability to probably uh increase that fixed model just slightly but it certainly won't return to such a fixed model that we had prior to covert okay thank you and then looking forward into the draft statement of intent referring to paragraph 3.12 in our report you will methodology to further inform draft sli forecasts by the time the final soi is due are you expecting that to deliver major changes to the statement of intent and at the same time noting obviously this is non-financial rather than financial are you expecting that to drive a major change we don't expect it to drive major change no um it's yeah I've been engaging with venus otahi on these two models which I am due to go and have a session with them to be updated they already have been taken into account to a large extent in the current draft soi forecasts so that they are built on that prioritization model okay that's great thank you any further questions on the um six monthly before half year performance report or on the soi yani um thanks um similar to the question asked at the workshop but what what I struggle to see some from the performance report is um which of the venues are performing and which ones aren't so what I'm really interested to understand is like the temporary stadium you it um they had the oval which I know vbas have had a relationship with so do we have any kind of sense of what's happening across the venues in terms of ones that are at least paying for themselves not not generating profit but not making massive losses yes we um obviously um own and operate uh the town hall and the arena and working with um with other um as the operator and manager of the luxe hagley operator and working with other owners there um it is and we've just taken on and transitioned just in the last month um for working with council on the on the orange theory stadium uh we will need to build on that information but we actually do have the event contribution is shown as a as a one line within the statement of intent but we do have that information on each of the venues and um and so we can draw that out and provide some further development yeah we can't we can certainly split it out I think the the couple of challenges and one of the stadium to uh and the under right from council for orange theory is that you know now that is a break even because of that uh the hagley oval for instance we have um at times we need to have a look at some of the commercial arrangements that have been put in place over the years and we run it a bit of a loss particularly because of r m associated with the pavilion and then town hall and arena we can split out those numbers but they're a bit more in our control yeah just to jump in I think some of this I mean there's clearly some commercial sensitivities around some of the broader subject matter we're talking about here um may well be dealt with um more appropriately in a briefing at the right time um rather than in this particular forum today given that to have the discussions that yanI's um wanting to have fully um it will inevitably require some discussion around commercially sensitive information so we're going to get a separate memo back aren't we that yeah we didn't discuss that on tuesday it will be a joint um a report back from the council and venue's order right do we have a date for the transition to be complete though that's still we're still waiting to hear from dpmc and the trust on that okay all right um just the other thing that I just um in terms of I see in the statement of intent but just in terms of the community access um what the community rate yeah I guess I was just interested to kind of understand how many community groups were using your venues if you've got like a figure and um yeah I guess just to get some sense of who's actually using the community right back on there obviously we've given you the number of events and the financials on there um but we can certainly break that down a little bit further as to who those groups are and and that is shown quarterly as well in regard to our performance measures so both quarterly and then within the half-year on the um on the results through to march um and even with moving into alert levels and the like um we are certainly on track in regard to that performance measure any further questions and is further um just another further question on the local cultural rate I think any opportunity to develop some sort of sponsorship model where businesses are actually able to pay for the money um for groups to use venues is there something that you've thought about similarly in a way is how we're trying to structure the utahi collective uh and that more syndicate approach to naming rights and so every one of those bespoke partnerships will have a community fund one of the other opportunities in the partnership is to be able to sponsor certain events and we could actually build in certain groups as well and the nice thing about how we're hopefully going to be able to design these bespoke partnerships is that businesses who partner with us will actually be able to align their strategic drivers with how they design their partnership and so if that's something we could build in yeah see that you could actually build really strong connections and relationships between businesses and community groups and and support them financially to get to use the venues you can see that happening yeah I think there's uh there are a few um businesses around that really want to do more in their corporate and social responsibility and community engagement and if we can support that and bring that connection to the fore then that would be a wonderful thing to be able to do yeah thank you that's really encouraging because it is about equity and equity of accessibility to our venues so thanks for that thank you so I'm happy to move the recommendation that's in front of us do I have a second for that sam mcdonald is there any debate yeah um they're both together in this so if you're not done with questions we'll come back to questions yes uh so that's um this we're currently paying the um interest cost the principal is um 14.8 million 14.8 million still been moved and seconded is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you very much thank you so now we'll
Good evening now everyone welcome back if we could take our seats and um I'll invite john billows to come to the table good evening thank you for being I'll turn yes thank you for having me um this is with regard to almost the submission here's with regard to the the decision not to provide fiber to our neighborhood at the top of huntsbream and it's with regard to our submission to the long-term plan we're 36 households up there I live about 10 minutes drive from the four halves we have water articulated power delivered rubbish collected a little spray buggy comes up our lane we're rated and zoned the same as our neighbors only a few hundred meters away yet the decision was made to stop fiber just that few hundred meters away from us initially that was um 350 meters straight up as you go up huntsbury ave it was a bit soul destroying to watch that fibre being laid as you drive up over the over the months it was happening and just as it got towards our place it's less than 350 meters there's further development on kenmur drive and those people are fiber connected and now it's it's a matter of a few um yet to be developed sections in our neighborhood that is the distance between us and fibre um you've all agreed that that fiber is necessary as evidenced by the approval of this whole project for fibre as a whole and it's for those good reasons for those same reasons the reasons why we want and need fibre service by copper to us is being removed vodafone have removed the copper services from us um and you have to you have to go on a 4g modem now and it's just sort of a bit of cruel twist that cellular service is where we are with visibility to a lot of cellular sites that are reasonably distant is a kind of a scenario for poor operation of a cellular network so that's inferior to copper and that's been removed our ability to participate in the digital economy and the digital workspace is workplace is affected our homes remote places like lake brunner and haast have fibre and bloody good on them that's great we're 10 minutes drive from the cbb and we don't so we ask please support us in funding and and funding the shortfall or please convince enable to use their discretionary spending I understand it's about 36 thousand dollars thank you very much thank you um yep thanks for the submission and um sorry that's enough time oh no I just wanted to check if you'd be happy to pay like on the monthly bill like a dollar or extra or something like a recovery fee if if that was it goes to the the all the different people out there personally I'll be happy to pay my share in a lump and I would um but you needed everyone on board yeah you need everybody on board somehow this is not the only area it's areas that that there are cut-off points around different parts of the city uh funded through the government program so we what you're asking us to do we can find some sort of resolution through the alternate process yeah and I imagine at some stage it's going to happen because there's more development up there but you know yeah yeah and yeah so no but um leave it with us you've really spelt out the case very clearly and um we'll see what we can do thank you thank you
Appreciate it ian lockheed kiara good afternoon good afternoon everyone uh thank you for the opportunity to address you this afternoon what I want to talk about today are two aspects of the more detailed written submission that I've already made and these are the core funding for heritage including heritage incentive fund and also the canterbury provincial council chambers I'm sure you're all familiar with the heritage strategy document which you adopted as council recently and I feel that this is a policy document that is not being fully reflected uh in the uh long-term plan as it stands at the moment I recognise that the document sits beneath the ltp but it should be informing it the strategy identifies goals for the protection of heritage through partnerships including the support of heritage buildings through ongoing provision of heritage incentive grants the public consultation for that policy identified key benefits of heritage as being community identity sense of place qualities that every city would be keen to have the consultation process also identified funding as the single most important tool to protect and retain heritage education the next most important tool the consultation process also identified lack of funding as the biggest barrier to heritage retention a high cost was also a significant barrier obviously linked to the importance of funding and lack of public awareness and appreciation was seen as a further barrier highlighting the importance of education it also revealed that the heritage incentive grant fund had a high level of visit visibility among council's heritage initiatives a very high number of heritage building owners consulted would welcome support to identify funding opportunities related to their buildings the heritage strategy 2019-2029 seeks to broaden the definition of heritage and to make heritage more inclusive but the ltp produces proposes reducing funding for heritage incentive grants the heritage festival and intangible heritage from seven hundred thousand a year to two hundred thousand a year uh in other words a reduction of five million over ten years this is being proposed in spite of the overwhelming evidence from the council's own recently adopted heresy heritage policy document that identifies funding as the single most important strategy for retaining heritage with education seen as a cherry-pick a small number of high-profile heritage projects for support through targeted rates shouldn't be a reason to drastically reduce funding for core policies that support ongoing heritage recognition and retention it's my submission that the core heritage funding should be maintained at the current level of 700 000 per annum for the duration of the ltp with annual adjustments for inflation I now want to speak briefly about the provincial council buildings well it's just I mean I just do know that you represent an organization but you it's submitted in as an individual one so if I sort of accept this is slightly more of a representation on behalf of civic building's trust I just I would like to give you a minute to finish the thank you very much I support the targeted rate for the provincial buildings but it needs to be applied directly to a program of work on the buildings themselves I think this is the way to convince others including central government to add their support to the provincial buildings we've talked about the restoring the provincial it uh in 2031 and I just want to end with a question to pi stands directly opposite the provincial buildings does council really want a broken heritage building as part of its front window to the world for the next 10 years yes it's an encouraging message that I'm sharing with central government at present thank you thank you thank you very much thanks now that brings us to another natural break in proceedings it's a
Thank you have a good evening thank you nadia maxwell definitely welcome uh kia ora koto my name is nadia maxwell I'm a film producer over active imagination um and my company is a tenant at the art centre and I almost didn't come today to speak today because I like to think that surely it's a given that the art centre will gain funding um surely in a city devastated by earthquakes that has seen so much of our heritage turn to dust that the largest collection of category one historic buildings not just in christchurch but in all of new zealand is worthy of ongoing operational support but then here we are it currently does not um and so I guess I'm curious from a heritage perspective um if the art centre is not the jewel and the crown of the christchurch city council then what is um but I guess I want to speak to you more today about my experience um as a business owner operating out of the arts centre a creative small business owner I first worked in the arts to children and my own company later and over those periods of seeing what the arts centre can offer offer businesses which is it offers community it offers connections and it offers creative inspiration um it seems a large focus of the rebuild has been uh I'm trying to concentrate like like-minded people and businesses into clusters and precincts here is an authentic creative hub that already exists it's organically built up over time and it provides all the kpis you could dream up for any pitch document on the future of our city provides employment supports and nurtures cultural expression it cements a unique brand for the city it contributes to a vibrant city etc etc and yet it doesn't receive any ongoing operational support when you support the arts centre you're supporting all the creative small businesses that call it home increasing the arts centre's sustainability and vitality will flow through to all of our businesses and these actual businesses and businesses that are not just returning economic returns to the city but cultural dividends so I hope you'll fiercely support the but beyond that I challenge you to think how is local government can you enable the arts centre not just to survive but to thrive thank you thank you I think the earlier submission made it clear that most people in in christchurch probably just don't realize that the council doesn't even own the art center so this has actually been a really good opportunity for the public to get their head around what needs to happen so thank you so much sam thank you very much I'm sure you know I think it was really valid what you've said I just wanted do you have any view on I mean this funding will sort of help them in the short term yeah of I guess that long term sustainability of the organization and you know I guess the structures that sit within it yeah I mean I came on in september and I think around that time there was quite a big restructure due to covert and various factors with the arts centre and I think my understanding is that the money that the long-term previous to cover that actually they were thriving a lot more you know there was a lot more events and things so I guess that's my closing statement of what else could be done to support the arts centre to you know so it can really thrive yeah thank you very much much appreciated ian lockheed
Exxon good afternoon everybody good afternoon welcome thank you I'm speaking about the closure of the farinari swimming pool and fitness centre new zealand has the third highest obesity rate in the oecd with one in three adults being classed as obese and maori people people having a disproportionately high rate of obesity fahrineeri swimming pool and sports centre is not situated in a particularly affluent community and there are an increasing number of people living in ricketton it's well used by the local residents who are from culturally diverse backgrounds there are many local community clubs that use this facility including islamic women's swimming group and tiwaka punamu these people will not be travelling to the cbd to use the new metro facility farinui is easily reached on foot and will be a convenient location on the new cycleway visitors to the new metro facility will almost certainly have to drive and pay for parking or take public transport how does this fit with the call to reduce emissions and slow the glacial melting in new zealand can any city council afford to make culturally associated health problems in our communities local primary and intermediate schools bring students to pharyneui during the day as as it's within close proximity and they can afford to do this with the time and funds they have available the 500 learn to swim members who currently use farinui may not have the time or the money to access the new metro facility assuming that it's available to them whilst the council may save a small amount of money if they close farinui what will the ultimate cost be when these young people grow up without learning to swim and we're faced with accidents and drowning in christchurch rivers and lakes and on our beaches sport new zealand and in particular swim in new zealand must have goals around performance in national and international events such as the commonwealth games and the olympics is christchurch city council really going to clause one of the oldest and most successful swimming clubs in the city when its members are olympic and paralympic hopefuls it's been widely publicized that christchurch city council incorrectly calculated the running costs for the terms of equity cultural responsiveness environmental concerns and health and safety it is the decision to close the pool that ought to be revisited I think christchurch city council should be supporting and celebrating our accomplished sports people and should also work to support natural national strategies around health and well-being for all of our new zealand residents thank you for your consideration in advance thank you well that comes to the conclusion of the time allocated but thank you very much for your presentation and as I said to the previous one this is the first of many that we know that we are receiving on this particular subject so thank you very much well was not the first because the community board raised it first but um thank you very much
Thank you ian the page welcome thanks for the opportunity to be able to speak I'm here to speak against the proposed uh closure of the acura service center uh here I find it very difficult to comprehend why you would want to close a service centre and take away a service from the community if you it appears that you're operating wanting to operate on electronic systems a lot more and if that was the case why wouldn't you be closing your bigger service centers which are which you've got access to the civic offices far more readily yeah the remote township of acura is quite unique in that it's based on a rural uh thing with a tourist as a tourist center it's basically an hour and a half from christchurch centre here and doesn't have a easy bus service between the two so why close the service centre it would appear that you've taken away a lot of the services that should be operating out of a service center so that um you argue arguable that the service I would suggest that you want to put more services into the service centre to allow them to to operate better an example would be recently I applied for a building consent building consents can't_''_110.72 be lodged at the service centres I came into the civic offices here I need to be told I only accept it on electronic format when I pointed out that the form actually says hardcopy is acceptable I was told I had an old form but I'd only downloaded that formal for your your website two days ago earlier what happened after that was they didn't enter this into my application into the system for five days in which case it went up to uh a senior building officer and went was sent back to the uh counter staff to to ring me and say that I i needed other information I pointed out to them that on the phone that I didn't I didn't need that other information it was there and I was correct and they put me through to the senior one they said oh well I in two hours two hours later and first thing he did was he said I must apologize to you I got it wrong why was that why why couldn't the service center have taken an application put it on a courier bag and sent it through if that's the way you want to handle the work it seems to me quite logical another way another aspect is the booking of the recreation ground that unfortunately totally out of order in the way that it's uh they don't understand and the form takes so long to fill in if you could do a face-to-face application uh this could be quite easy easy done and the person could actually fill the form in it electronically at the counter at the service centre thanks for the opportunity look thank you very much for for coming and and making a submission in person that's much appreciated and I know that there are a lot more of the submissions that we're going to hear on this particular subject having looked at some in advance so you are not alone thank you um cyril
Appreciated thank you thank you glenn livingston good to see you all I won't be too tough on you today my simple p please if you keep the rates remission policy it is remission one not-for-profit community-based organizations intact that would be really good so I'm coming at this from a church perspective and through mayor I'm I'm open to any questions well the the question is is that um you think that even a large organisation if it's a charitable trust with a huge cash balance should be able to get an automatic rates right yeah it's a good question and I know yes which I did anticipate but um I did put that in my submission the problem is the churches aren't all the same so there will be various permutations over this relating to the threshold by which you might uh not continue that uh policy so they are all different that that's the problem we talk about that church but all churches are different yeah so that but the threshold I guess is you're not you're submission to the to the idea that there will be some that have large cashmere yeah no no I'm no to be fair I've thought about that they they just chalk and cheese some of them so yeah yeah yep uh tim and sarah um are religious organisations exempt to texts yes that's my understanding thank you thank you glenn um we've had some submitters on a similar topic mention having large cash balances due to saving money over time for things like maintenance and those kind of things is that how the system works within the church organizations do they accumulate for one-off big spends or is that done differently some do accumulate large amounts of capital but in the mainline denominations for instance of which I'm apart any capital gain from for instance property sale has to go back to an organization an organization like the church property trustees so it's not free uh to spend so the money is there it's kind of a classic case of um you know asset rich cash pool okay thanks anyone else with a with your work I know it gets a bit heated sometimes I much appreciate it nice to see you thank you
Very good thank you miriam o'connor welcome good afternoon okay can you imagine what it would be like to help solve the housing problem in christchurch we need more housing that people can afford and I want to contribute I suggest that some of the surplus properties can help fulfill the council objective of making sure there is supply and access to a range of housing since the earthquakes I have been sharing my own home and also offering rental accommodation to young people who have no prospect of buying or building a home of their own many of these tenants and flatmates dreamed of owning a tiny home that means an affordable small cottage with a small environmental footprint where they could live independently without the long-term stress of a mortgage in an uncertain job market so why don't they well the top three things that people who want to go tiny struggle with are firstly the initial cost if the home is over fifty thousand secondly not knowing how to design and build to code and thirdly not knowing where to put the home and how makes it hard for people to share property ownership or do co-housing so how will a tiny co-housing project sponsored by council help these people realize their dream firstly the cost we can make a tiny house really affordable we're going to make them even more accessible with a rent to buy option secondly standards our builds are architecturally designed thirdly landscaping will give private and shared space veggie gardens and a community kitchen we will provide a model of navigating all the compliance requirements that people struggle with we invite council to let us work with you to contribute to solving the housing problem through developing sites for fully consented co-housing tiny house communities the benefits for council and christchurch are the increase in the supply and range of quality housing and as they become tiny homeowners people develop a stake in the community small is beautiful good got a quick question aaron one word brilliant thank you for your encouragement I was going to say if I was to ask a question I'd ask if anyone else in the room didn't think that was brilliant thank you glenn livingston
Time to make your submission thank you much appreciated christopher owen good afternoon I'm going to talk about cycleways and why the council should spend more than the currently allocated 250 million over 10 years paul winton of the 1.5 project analyze how much transport emissions need to be reduced to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees his assessment was that we orbit need to decarbonize our transport system in the next 10 years the chrysler city council has declared a climate emergency that implies urgent dramatic transformative action is required when looking at this long-term plan you need to ask yourself is this transformative or are we just changing the status quo a little the goal that the council should be aspiring to is copenhagen or amsterdam in terms of bike usage and if you don't think that's realistic ask yourself why not christchurch has flat terrain wide streets a mild climate and e-bike tales are soaring fifty years ago copenhagen and amsterdam were just or car cities just like christchurch and building good cycleways isn't just a win for the environment it also reduces spending now christchurch has built some outstanding cycling infrastructure since starting the major cycle routes program and I agree 25 million per year on cycleways isn't pocket change but you're also spending 20 million dollars per year just on resealing roads and even then the mcr program won't be completed until 2029 the entire northeast quadrant of christchurch is still waiting for its first mcr standard cycle routes so here are my requests to the council on cycleway spending allocate enough funds to complete the mcr program by 2025. start planning the cycle routes that will come after the mcr is complete fill in the gap to connect these routes and make a true network reduce the speed limits on residential roads to 30 kilometers an hour and create low traffic neighborhoods when you're doing curb renewals or major street upgrades create protected bike lanes at the same time build back better and here's a big one set up funding specifically to create cycle routes using temporary materials such as paint planter boxes and lightweight barriers if you travel down ferry road right now you new cycleway in just this kind of manner now take that idea and go for the big bang approach instead of patiently building one cycle route at a time over the course of years like we're doing now build them everywhere all at once as soon as possible make them permanent later as money allows last year cities such as paris and berlin followed exactly this approach to make the biggest difference on climate we should be front loading change as much as possible spending pressures on the council are strong but this is one area where I think the council needs to be bold be brave and be ambitious and aim for something truly transformational thank you for your time very good thank you very much that was um very good thank you
Much for that thank you madame thank you kevin lamb thank you good afternoon madam mayor and councillors my submission relates to five topics the revenue and financing policy water rates the heritage targeted rate land information memorandums and council-controlled organisations the revenue and financial policy refers to the rates charged by the council as equitable equitable means equal treatment to everyone I've attached to my submission samples of properties selected on a random basis which shows properties are not given equal treatment the uniform annual chart annual general charge has increased by four percent to 138 dollars I looked through the documents I got a paper copy I couldn't find where it says it's been increased by four percent I had to inquire to the staff this does not seem to be explained in the document why did it increase it by four percent nor is there any reference where this rates collection we allocated to the revenue and finance policy is misleading and the wording needs to be clarified to state our council council rates to be open transparent and democratically accountable christchurch is the charge water rates on a solely capital value basis the council sees us as reflecting a perceived ability to pay based on the difference in a property's capital value if the meters are being read twice a year then all right power should be charged by meter the heritage targeted rate should be a uniform charge the same as the cathedral charge the land information services draft budget says it shows a surplus in excess of 1.6 million charges for limbs should be reduced to similar to adjoining territorial authorities to reduce this surplus enable services is not a significant significant activity as there are other contractors who are able to do this work this company should be sold council controlled organizations should be working within the city boundaries and requests should be made to cchl to bring the activities within the city boundaries within five years thank you um melanie could you provide more clarity and why you think we should sell enable when it's predicted to give us quite a large dividend this year it's not the business business you're in it's my uh providing that service you really only you're the only organisation you're the only territorial authority in new zealand that has uh a surface like that okay well thank you very much for taking the time to make your submission thank you much appreciated christopher owen
Good afternoon good afternoon everybody my submission today going to cover the good the bad and the ugly so the good is you announce climate change emergency I completely support that and I believe that a lot of people told you they don't want you to raise any rates money need to be addressed to do it I'm happy for you to raise my rates to do it please do um in the proposal the long term plan you said you're going to do a lot of river restoration similar to what you did along the heat code I'm completely supporting of that I am completely supporting of cycle ways now I'm coming to the bed lately it says that cycleways have gone to 300 million dollars I think that's not true the benefit is normally for not only for the cyclist I used quarry mains quite often half of the project cost was to replace three roundabouts with traffic lights the contention is no longer there people enjoy it it's not the cyclist is there but it's the motorist so we run by susan violence the mayor was there and that was talking about how community are recovering from natural disasters and it says that central government comes over promise under deliver take the rights away and slowly bring the rights back to the local community that's what's happening now what's unique in crutches we head share an idea and insurance idea it says that people of christchurch want you to build cycleways and may have a green city looking into the future I believe in about 30 years we'll be as big as auckland today we'll be all the way from pegasus to rollerstone now it's the time to put infrastructure in so we don't have the contention now it's the time so that's the bed and please go and do it coming to the ugly guys I'm sorry kaitority speed a farmer but the farmer removed a third of indigenous critically injured plant away and the best you can come at was non-disclosure agreement that's not good enough if that was the only case maybe gardner's road four years just along guzman road just off johns road after the stixx mill sections are very small houses are very big the first house have a big grainy grass in front of him when you check it that's grass is actually a city council park part of the styx mill he take in a whole section remove plants that sweep paid money to planter put a grass on it put a lovely fence and I know that someone in the city council mentioned it when to consent consent well it's not consent he didn't ask for consent he went to the park the park said well it's consent you need to deal with consent and we run in between the backwards and forward so that's if I'm not wrong fall straight to uh gardner's road if you drive there you'll see it's very obvious I actually been on the grass a few times and he lives in the house and he doesn't come out and ask what I'm doing on his property because it's not his property emergency now it's time to act and I'm happy to pay for it thank you thank you perfect timing thank you very much
Appreciate it melanie glidden welcome I'll start by thanking pro I thoroughly endorse everything she said so thank you for this opportunity I'm speaking in regard to the oops I'll put these on started wearing these uh to the council's plan to sell paddock land and diamond harbour for possible housing development I moved to diamond harbour three years ago from wellington a big part of my decision was the natural beauty the quiet the sense of community and the remoteness the majority of residents have also moved there consciously for those reasons knew that I'd alter my life to not travel to the city very often I would come in every week and a half as I don't believe in the indulgence of private commuting especially single drivers and petrol cars I don't think it's the way of the future the road between our small community is problematic and dangerous it's very costly for the council to maintain the large flat plains at the base of the harbour the tidington flats are very susceptible to sea level rise and permanent support increased population there would be a lot for the council to put in place before this could happen I've heard that this proposed sale is being rushed through without proper community consultation is the council in such dire need for money we would love to see more council direction and creativity for this land use otherwise we're open to exploitation these pieces of land are enjoyed by many it's green space for mental physical health would it be possible to gift these paddocks to the community something creative like a retirement living opportunity there are lots of elderly people in diamond harbor who often tell me that they would love to live there just a bit longer before having to move into town and they'd love something like that any questions sarah thank you there's quite a number of submissions on um those couple of pieces of land um do you think there's capacity within the community to form a trust for example to because you mentioned gifting yeah to form a trust to take care of them for the planting because the yeah I do it's a very sort of proactive community I think they'd take that on okay thanks yeah james kia ora um through melanie I beg your pardon um do you realize though that a retirement village would require the land to be sold yes we wouldn't be developing yeah okay and I don't know who to who would do that in a lovely way people want sort of eco village you know just a smaller place to live safer okay not a not a rhyming village I think that um I just the the um provisions on the sale of property are simply they're not the decision to sell the property so they are simply allowing it to be on the ltp so that if individual decisions were going to be made then there wouldn't have to be a special consulting procedure this is the ltp process so it's if if it proceeds on on the the way it's set out at the moment then that is not the decision to sell it so um there would be there would of doesn't necessarily mean a sale either so right um yeah I just wanted to give some reassurance that it's not the end of a process it would be simply allowing for a process to proceed without the special consultant procedure of the local government act it still goes through the community boards does it yes it still goes through the community still has advice and um great yeah it's just it takes away the special consultant procedure which this is and and we're getting feedback on quite a bit of the pieces of land um as we go which is good what we would intend thank you
Thank you thank you um can you hear me alright yeah um first of all I'd like to thank you all for taking on public office because I'm sure it's a very difficult job representing us but also thank you for hearing us um I was grateful to be allowed to speak on both submissions and save me coming in twice actually if it's all right I was just going to merge the two because climate change was actually the focus of both my submissions because I now think it is the most vital and urgent issue to plan for and the next 10 years are probably the only chance to set things on the path to sustainable living so I think your work on the 10-year plan is probably the most important ever and and as chris horn said before we need you to put the climate change lens over every part of that plan um my main focus in both submissions actually was transport partly because it's a major major contributor to climate change but also because it's one that we can active transport more attractive and I have heard that the cycle routes are not used much but I dispute that because I see people on them all the time and in lockdown we saw so many people enjoying cycling when there was no traffic to compete with so I think that speaks for itself I'm lucky enough to have an e-bike so I now hardly ever use my car except on long trips out of town it's cheaper it's healthier it's just as quick as in the car in congested traffic and I don't have any parking problems though I would like to encourage you to put more bike parking in the city um but also I enjoy it and I would be interested to know how many of you actually are not cyclists because if you haven't cycled around the town I'd invite you to come and join me sometime um and in the meantime I would just tell you a few of my experiences my son because I live in heathcote valley my son used to bike to school along the and down from to and from littleton and although I was encouraging him to be independent I was super anxious at first and I was convinced that I would hear um an ambulance siren nursing id left home but anyway he made it but then one day a friend of his knocked at the door after three o'clock holding my son's bike helmet saying he'd had an accident and of course my son is now nearly 40 but I still remember that ghastly moment which I think no parent should actually have to go through um and then he did survive clearly a couple of years later he arrived home ashen faced because a truck had just turned immediately in front of him and virtually wiped him out nearly wiped him out and I think also no child should have to go through that um and so it is no wonder that that parents drive their children to school and you know see the drop in traffic in the school holidays or the rise like now when I biked in I had to cope with the three have my own experience of a truck pulling out into port hills road right in front of me and he and I both slammed on our brakes it was daylight I had lights on I had a high vis vest but he still didn't see me I could have just become another biking fatality statistic but that kind of traffic and bikes are not a good mix and so I think to increase the use of bikes and to decrease car use I really want to encourage you to spend on safe cycle ways now not put them off to the future on the major ones and also on smaller connecting networks and I guess my particular plug would be for bringing forward the healthcare cycle away funding just because I live there but all of them um I think if we can get it safe for children to bike to school if children are biking to school then they will become a generation of adults who will bike and so we can cut back on car use we could make christchurch city known as a city that's that will we admire around the world along with that but I haven't got time much to talk about is planning and designing with access to amenities within 15 or 20 minutes of active or public transport from where we live what have I got just nearly two minutes okay so another event I had recently to bike to avon sign and part of the trip had to be on the busy linwood ave and I realized how stressed and anxious I was being squeezed over to the side of the road by heavy traffic but also having to scan all the parked cars that I had to pass just in case one of them suddenly opened their door and flung me under some of this traffic and then once I got onto the wonderful off-road cycle path that's between the trees down the rest of lynnwood I realized how suddenly I could relax and I could enjoy the ride after having had to be hyper alert when merging mingling with all that traffic so I'm really asking you to build safe cycle ways and the cyclists was actually waiting for a bus at the bus stop opposite the colombo and it was a dark cold wet rush hour and just while I was waiting for the bus I counted over 50 cyclists passing me negotiating that heavy traffic in those miserable weather conditions so just think how many more cyclists would be keen to if we had a better safer route for them to take and I would like to thank you for the ones that you have done so far so I think they're great so build safe cycle ways and do it now and also spend money on promoting behavior change we need education programs we need to make the whole thing attractive maybe even better um sign posting on the existing cycle way so that it's easier to navigate them and so please recognize and act on the urgency of climate change because nothing else will matter if we don't act now so think about your legacy and what you will be remembered for and I think I once said before please don't be like those city councillors in his subway rapid transport voted it down by one vote so please don't be you know people are saying now if only we'd listen to robbie how short-sighted were we so thank you very much and I don't imagine you have any questions no thank you very much much appreciated
It's fine perpelgan good afternoon everyone um I wrote in and I believe that my remarks were recorded um against some of the uh submissions in the long term plan regarding two in particular of our cultural gems um one I was led to believe that the art gallery which holds a free information evening and is open on a wednesday evening were being asked or it is proposed to ask them to have only one of those late nights a month and an otherwise 25 percent cut in their education budget and I wholeheartedly disagree with with that when I know that money is tight and I do understand that there's a balancing act that goes into what our councillors have to do we mustn't lose the benefits that we have available to our citizens the art gallery is an amazing and and wonderful feature of christchurch looking at the other major cities in new zealand auckland have a very nice art gallery obviously wellington have te papa and there's a lot a great deal of historic and wonderful history available in dunedin but christchurch there is sublime please please reconsider and secondly it's also on a cultural matter I understand that the art centre have asked for further funds and they may have asked for more than the council have been prepared to give them and once again keeping in mind that there is only so much money to go around don't let us lose what the art centre gives christchurch for tourism yes you know top of the list but also for christchurch citizens we've had a wonderful wonderful I'm trying to think of the word asset in in that area of land that section of the city is it's full of memories for almost everyone I'm sure in this room um and for many of our community please don't hold back on those funds I did put forward a couple of suggestions I'm sure that the I'm not I'm not the first person to have suggested this but in early days the art centre had parts of the building refurbished as apartments and obviously that must have been a revenue in income comes to getting money into their coffers the corner site with the ducks deluxe was is languishing and sad to look at I know that they are working very hard to bring um some potential into that back into that space um independently of the other work that they're doing there thank you very much so much thank you very much much appreciated
Detailed in there thank you very much brilliant uh lindsay carswell good afternoon all right you've seen me before numerous times but this time I want to go over the complaints procedure this is something I have asked numerous occasions over the last 20 years because the problem I had my unit started over 20 years ago building I purchased did not comply with the building code as it was then the plans had submitted to the council and approved did not comply um a number of building inspections that were carried out were zero the building was signed off as being code compliant by a senior building inspector who never came and looked at the building and simply signed it off as project complete building is riddled with non-compliances I've done a lot of research into how the building code works and I'm quite appalled at what happened to me the council as far as I was concerned the building services unit was completely dysfunctional what was even worse was the response I got when I tried to make a complaint I got the total run the complete opposite I was given advice which was totally inaccurate I went through mediation for the council person from the council had obviously never heard of acting in good faith I've never known a person to lie so convincingly it took me ages to work out some of the things that he said during that hearing which were a total pack of rubbish then we a few years later after all that I gave up which was what the council wanted me to do then a few years later we had an earthquake and during a hearings into the collapse of certain buildings it became very apparent to the government that the building services united here was in fact dysfunctional and they were replaced they had a commissioner appointed to oversee everything so I wasn't joking there were problems serious problems the other thing I want to say also was to you is that as counselors I've come along and watched a lot of meetings I've been involved in a lot of areas and I'm also concerned about the fact that the staff give was all that talk about um needing a balanced budget about five or six years ago now and it's claimed that you had to have one that the orders had said that if you don't sell off city care so you can have a buddhist budget there will be no audit report that was absolute rubbish I wrote to the order of the general and they came back and said no they don't have to have a business budget but your staff kept telling you you did I remember a few couple two three years ago now in one of the old subcommittees where I went along and made a submission emotion was passed it was never recorded the staffs didn't record emotions by people members of the public coming along thanks lindsay that's um no I mean it's a it's appreciated I understand that there's um a lot of history and a lot of things have happened in the past and a lot of things have changed as well no they haven't and I'm assuring you that a number have changed and uh and the the way our building consents um department works now is up to the standard of best practice in the country um it had lost its accreditation for a number of reasons completely unassociated with the um royal commission of inquiry so but but leaving all that aside I understand the point that you've raised you've made your point well and um I'd like to thank you very much for putting all the evidence just thinking submission you need to have an independent place procedure thank you there are independent processes in place now in relation to building consents there are and it's uh you can get a determination through any remains you never used to be able to do I remain unconvinced good no that's fine do so
Jeff barnes welcome thank you madame erin councillors my concern is your proposal to charge for excess supply to the residential sector I submit that you should not make this proposal the meters on which it is based are substantially old and will probably be inaccurate for billing purposes therefore to subs to give credibility to potential bills they need to be replaced 10 to 15 years or 15 years as auckland standard the cost could well be four million dollars a year if you did it on a rolling cycle to replace something like 100 000 meters over the next 10 years the excess charge calculation is far too high based on the figure supplied by council the marginal cost of supply of water is 13 cents gst included not a dollar 35. the infrastructure costs are already provided within the targeted rate for water the capital value-based targeted rate it is the extra pumping costs to deliver an extra cubic meter of water which is the topic in fact your manager referred to that this revenue potential revenue would cover the extra pumping costs 13 cents gst included who do not have are not separately meted and cannot be ever separately meeted because they share one common supply and to separate the plumbing within the property boundary is prohibitive therefore those who are separately meted share an unreasonable burden under your proposal it doesn't recognize that consumers who have a higher capital value property and are paying therefore higher capital value targeted water rates will be subject to the same limit of 700 liters per day that is grossly unfair they've already paid for the extra water that potentially is consumed your billing operating costs will be high I go back I was employed by the council I go back to putting piles of paper for write-offs to counsel for the range of charges which were disputed or were minor it is a contentious area you will live to regret it personally because it will occupy quite a bit of your time it will upset the ratepayers and they will be vocal in their opposition to this when the bills start coming out uh gardening will be discouraged we are the garden city it is a discourage that plants cost money substantial sums of money and if the p if the citizens lose their plants in their garden they will turn to because their reluctance to water they will turn to you for their complaints it is grossly unfair the actual problem though is that you have let the water system run down it is 20 of water extracted is wasted through leakage that is the problem leak prevention leak monitoring that is the problem that should be addressed and is not addressed by this proposal it is in the council system the bulk of the problem lies the second issue is that you haven't increased that is the amount of time that we have allocated for this admission but um thank you I mean you've put a lot of thought and detail into this and um we do understand that there are a balance of issues that we're going to have to consider when we make our decision on the on the ltp but thank you very much thank you thank you and if there's further written information that you'd like to submit through please
Okay thank you uh doug rankin yoda good afternoon curry good afternoon uh madam mayor councillor staff ladies and gentlemen I'll just read a summary of what I've stated in my submission my name is douglas rankin I was born in christchurch and live in craycroft I'm 68 years old I'm a scientist and hold a bsc honors and phd in chemistry from the university of canterbury environment canterbury scientific evidence in a paper which I've also tabled along with this documentation today shows that the water quality in christchurch's groundwater aquifers will decline significantly as a result of the farming currently permitted and that recently proposed under planned chain 7 in the adjacent waimakariri river catchment nitrate concentrations will increase in all of the aquifers in christchurch from which christchurch obtains its currently safe untreated drinking water the nitrate levels will pose serious health risks and costs on the community from inc increased colorectal and other cancers and poor birth outcomes if nothing is done to significantly reverse and reduce the high nitrate levels of leaching from farming and the waimakariri catchment the will be permanent and all for the benefit of a few farmers a new drinking water source will have to be found for the city at an estimated cost of over a billion dollars we will not have protected this resource for future generations therefore in my view and I would ask that the city council long-term plan addressed the threat to its infrastructure investment further work must be done in conjunction with ecan to establish how bad this problem will be and what can be done to fix it before it gains pace and gets worse ecan claims to have the problem in hand but nothing is further from the truth as the data in the diagram shows huge productions and nutrients released from farming are required to protect this groundwater resource 94 from the current tallest band in that diagram and 92 percent from what's proposed in plancheon 7 requirements to meet the small load out on the right hand side of that diagram in my view the city council needs to act otherwise a lot of current infrastructure investment will be wasted and many more costs that that's reflected very much the submission that we made on the drinking water bill that's before parliament the water supply bill that's before parliament at the moment we introduced additional evidence to back up exactly what you've just said I wish they'd had a copy of that earlier to present as well but we've presented that we um we're very aware of the significance of the threat that this poses to our future water supply so do you think um working with ecan is a sensible thing to help progress this because it seems to me as though there's a disconnect here yeah between the different organizations the the the difficulty is is that the drinking water um the standard the the tolerance level for nitrate is set at an unreasonably high level based on acute exposure as opposed to long-term exposure which is why another trial on colorectal cancer correlation needs to be done in another country and new zealand is the ideal place to to be that trial place so I mean we've submitted on this for or we are working with as closely as we possibly can um they're responsible I mean I know it'll end up in the environment court the plan change so we'll see what happens but thank you very much for doing all this research and thank you for caring thank you jeff barnes
Um next is um daniela umbagosi keoritato thank you for the opportunity um I've written some comments to stick to my three minutes and I won't say anything about strengthening community fund because an earlier submitter chris horne has really spoken very well about it and I could only repeat some similar things so can I add my support to chris horne's submission I wanted to add a couple of comments on rubbish recycling and organics and as they also relate to the general topic of roading infrastructure traffic congestion and cycling now as well as concerns with safety either perceived or actual danger of being the victim of an accident or an assault another factor that is discouraging people from cycling is broken glass on the roads and I thought it was at least in some areas but I showed my draft to a neighbor who cycles as his only means of transport and he assures me that it's in all areas of christchurch if I'm allowed to share some observations and they're not necessarily all my own observations with more info housing to clean up the area outside the gate and we also notice many commercial garden maintenance people use leaf blowers um to blow rubbish along rather than brooms and so that and also they're coupled with the fact that thinner glass is being used in probably most bottles all of this contributes to the problem of having enormous amounts of broken glass on the road and glass is a wonderful product I think if only the bottles could be manufactured to a standard to allow reuse like they used to be when they were thicker and then eventual recycling of course and perhaps a refundable deposit on bottles as is the case in some states of australia I believe perhaps that would lead to less broken glass on the road more reuse recycling and fewer bottles thrown from passing cars now another observation that led to a new idea and for a while now I've been noticing bits of knock of noxious weed called old man's beard one of the few I know appearing in all sorts of places commercial premises and residential and casual conversations with a team of people who are constantly on the road and who could be spotting it and reporting it to the appropriate people and that's the drivers of waste collection trucks um they're in a perfect position to to spot because you know they're higher they're observant they have to be you should see what they have to do in some areas to get to the bins and I'm sure it would be easy enough to train them to identify to report and perhaps it would add to their job satisfaction as well I wanted to ask if anybody had any question questions about my section of um the submission on the proposal uh regarding not-for-profit organizations with high cash balances and we've had a number of submissions on it and um it will be carefully considered but your submission is it's a very detailed submission so um thank you you can certainly take it as read from all of us and um thank you very much for all of the time and energy you've put into developing it thank you for your time thank you thank you doug rankin
Um submission is uh david gibbons good afternoon and welcome thank you mayor my original submission was in support of the special heritage rate for the arts centre I received a an email to request my support for that and because of my desire to see both heritage and amenity assets restored sort of in the city I offered my support what I subsequently did is actually looked at other similar type initiatives and projects that are also being proposed to be funded within the ltp and what's you know interesting when you download the csv file that you have on your your website is there are a significant number of um heritage um community assets including the performing arts precinct the provincial chambers the municipal chambers the roman google gallery that are receiving long-term capital funding in respect of that and I suppose my question is why has the art centre been singled out for a special heritage rate when these other properties haven't_''_78.08 been and what is the process to determine um you know how you allocate that capital to those projects which in my view our artistic heritage back in the back in the community I think the answer to that question and and gosh I wish that I'd known that it hadn't been explained um well enough but uh essentially the um all of the other projects are on our budget but they're within the the rates um and the question is should we pull them out of rates funding and put them into a targeted rate so people can see that they're contributing to these heritage buildings and that there is a way to bring things onto the budget that wouldn't otherwise be the art center is one of those so there is no um liability or responsibility with the city council to fund the arts center because it's an independent trust and what we're asking the people of christchurch is would they consider contributing to it and we thought the most transparent way was to include an uh targeted rate because it will be time specific yeah and I suppose the question is and whether it's known that the arts centre is independently owned other assets you know are actually vested sort of in council I think would be you know uncertain to the majority of the ratepayers in the city I don't think they would distinguish at all between the ownership of those assets they would look at those facilities and they would decide you know or not um the value that they had to the community and citizens of christchurch I suspect that you're right that a lot of people would assume that the council owned the arts centre that that that would that would be the assumption I think are there any other assets that uh historical assets might sort of fall you know into a similar category I'm assuming that the cathedral sort of obviously falls within that the cathedral the cathedral is not owned by the council the museum is owned um under legislation um by a trust but the count the four councils contribute to it so christchurch city contributes the most to its operational expenditure um uh waimakariri salwan and hirono so I mean so the question therefore is you know can council probably of respect to that and those that sit outside of councils control you know the ability to fund that by way of a of a special rate which I'm very supportive I would say that you know potentially casting the net wider beyond the art centre is something that the you know should be investigated as well yeah well the the um what's gone out for consultation does cast the net wider it does pick up those other buildings that you suggest and puts it into a targeted rate the reason for specifically spelling out both the art centre and the base isolation of robert mcdougall was that they were not currently provided for in our ltp okay yes thank you god thank you very much and thank you for your submission next is
Yeah thanks for the opportunity thank you uh and next is uh claire higginson and kay chamberlain oh it's just clear is it and thank you very much for agreeing to swap with graham so he could get to the dentist no trouble hope he doesn't have too much trouble there so thanks people for hearing I'm one of the people who lives at the atlas quarter in wells street in the city um the other atlas quarter people are talking on saturday but unfortunately I couldn't make it on saturday we're new to christchurch we came here because you had a strategy about having people come and living in the inner city so and we're really glad we came so thank you so much for that we love the walkability we love to the work that you're doing to increase that eating going to the movies shopping exercising cultural activities etc it's just awesome so we are sort of surprised to see the limited attention to the residents access to council services like the one mentioned here about the the rubbish still thinking well it's no use just saying I don't like this but what I was thinking was you've got your project 8011 which has six goals and they're all about encouraging um developers and looking at internal infrastructure and stuff maybe you could add a seventh goal the goal would be to customize council service delivery to meet the needs of inner city homeowners maybe to do that you'd need some sort of working relationship with a group of inner city people or potential inner city people but that's really what I wanted to say thanks yeah no I think that a number of residents um who are on the boundary of the collection roots have have highlighted these things I know jake's raised it before as well sarah thank you and thanks for making the time to come in when you're talking about um central city resident is it mainly from what I could get from reading the submissions around that higher density um stuff when it comes to the waste collection yeah that's one of the things if have 330 rubbish bins outside our gate which is probably not very practical but there are other things even you know wall street's very small it's only a block but it's got say 10 restaurants several retail outlets three car parks and um other sort of service delivery thing it's really short it's really raggedy it's got no rubbish bins it's it looks like it's neglected but it's there's hundreds of people live there yeah but do you think they um so for example the rubbish that's right on the boundary you know basically that'd be all right except that we've got intensification and those higher developments going in other parts of city that aren't cbd too do you think it's a an issue for all of those high-density areas I think everyone as you get 20 000 people everyone's going to come across these same things that we're coming coming across okay thanks but I'm hearing you say that you would like a mechanism whereby you could work directly with council's a good thing yeah I think it's a good thing too yeah yeah I'll be happy to be part of it if if you like but there'll be a system that you guys can go through to make that happen but yeah if you're going to get 20 000 people they all probably want something a wee bit different to whatever's there now yeah no that that sounds great I'm sorry but we're just at the end thanks very much thanks a lot and we look forward to hearing that others from weld street on saturday thank you
Okay so climate change is a bit shorter um just yes fossil fuel fuel use as you were well aware I'm sure is connected to everything and I think what that means is that you really need to make sure that climate change is a part of every single decision that you make is considered in every single decision that you make so I a separate strategy kind of feels a bit strange to me and I'd really like to see somewhere in that strategy that it needs to be considered in every single decision that the council makes and I'd also quite like something about the precedence so the importance of this work this climate change work you know it's it's one thing for it to be considered and it's another thing if it's not considered to be very important I think it really is so I would make it quite a high precedence um and I think you know managing managing the ongoing impacts of climate change this is where you actually need to be building community resilience because they're's just to go back to my point earlier about strengthening communities funding um and oh yeah I guess uh it is a pretty hard I think it's quite a hard ask to get everything right in the strategy but an important aspect of it is a capacity to kind of evaluate how it's going and to adapt it because systems have a really bad habit of adapting around things to make them stay the same and we've seen a lot of that so just expect more of that and build some adaptive capacity into that strategy I think that's what I want to say well you could mention the bus infrastructure and your remaining minute if you wanted to because the public transport infrastructure because it is linked to climate change as well yeah that's right um yes I do um I just want to support that uh you know I live in hawesville I know that every single road into the city every single road into the city every morning is clogged as congested and the only way we're going to build and lincoln road is one of those we really need a bus lane all the way up there so that we can get so so people don't get stuck in traffic because there's absolutely no incentive for people to get on a bus if they're going to get stuck in traffic and have to stop all the way into town so I think building that infrastructure is pretty important and I'd like to see it done soon very soon high priority and I quite liked your um asking us to change the word blueprint I've I've got a natural antipathy all right thank you very much for making the time available and for submitting on both much appreciated yeah thanks for the opportunity thank you uh and next is uh
We um move on to chris horne who has two submissions one's the ltp submission and the other is a climate change submission so um the climate change solutions on the hub in the same area as well so yeah thank you chris welcome can you hear me all right yes yes okay uh so I'm doing my ltp one first uh the main things I wanted to talk about here um just to highlight because there's quite a lot of different things in the in the submission which are all important of course um but strengthening communities funding is probably higher my list of concerns um I sort of wonder when it was last increased actually it's been a long time from what I understand and so that means over time it's actually decreased already on what it was um and I i actually think it needs to go up uh I've just come from manuka cottage which is a small community group that's funded by you guys uh and I've dealt with you know everything today I've cooked lunch and trying to find them some help around the place we've had a mask making group we've had a single dad who came in looking for company we've had a couple of new older women who've had a bit of a hard time recently and have just turned up and needed a bit of connecting in there's a lot that happens in community groups and communities and I think you know you really need to fund us I could say the same things go on in horseball all the time so that's really important resilience work and we really need that work given the whole climate change thing given the sorts of issues that we've had to deal with in the last decade for example the second thing I want to talk about is the major cycleways and I would say please please please keep them as a really high priority I use them constantly and one of the women that came into the hub today um is is kind of finding it hard to get around in her car because uh it much income so she's thinking about getting a bike and it was wonderful I was able to say look you know you live in spraydon and there's a cycleway here and there's a cycleway there and there's a cycleway and so she's actually able she will be able to get a bike and she'll be able to go some meaningful places on it um and that will save her an enormous amount of money and she's in her 70s it'll keep her healthy and well as well so um cycleways are really important for all those reasons I brought a few um a few copies of articles just recently from the news the sorts of things that have come across my facebook all based on research I've only got three things so I'll just leave them here and you guys can have a look at them for those who haven't seen them because I know some of you will have seen them um just to kind of back up the idea that cycleways are really important things for a to keep people healthy well to build community and and to encourage more cycling from a climate change perspective and the last thing is that I thought I'd highlight as uh public transport infrastructure so this is really important stuff really want to see that continue well it's perfect because you've now seen segway into your climate change one year that's right okay so climate change
So um thank you to claire higginson and kay chamberlain and welcome to you graham and I'll hand over to you thank you very much folks and I can give you the thanks of my dentist who has got me down to quarter past four in beckham so hopefully this will be less painful well we never know um I've provided a submission uh with three requests at the beginning and they're reasonably simple and I think the reason for the emphasis on in this case on the support for the public programs at the christchurch art gallery is reasonably well argued it's a micro matter as far as the this council is concerned but I asked to speak because it's representative of an approach to trying to save money I have observed as a public servant and more lately as somebody who watches what goes on in councils for at least the last 35 years and it seems to me that to make a claim that somehow you can find savings in the system that has already been optimized to death over that period energy and the causing of a lot of damage to morale for no real possible gain so I've emphasized the way in which this unique facility in the city meets the needs of a very large number of people far more than might be expected what may not be clear to you is that the council through for instance its provision of support for art education in the city to primary schools is subsidizing the ministry of education to the tune of about two hundred thousand dollars a year I cannot believe that that sort of subsidy isn't being repeated uh in a great many other ill-considered areas of the city's budget and would request that the energy that's put into trying to cut costs uh be focused instead on finding ways to ensure that the costs that are actually clearly essential as far as the people of the city are concerned for where they actually ought for and not on the ratepayers of christchurch where that's inappropriate have any questions if not I'll bugger off to the dentist thank you but thank you it's much appreciated and I think asking us to look to a natural funding partner um is a good good point to make so does anyone have any questions no thank you very much and I know that the art gallery would value very much the thought that you've given to this as well thank you thank you so now we
Thank you welcome good afternoon thank you for hearing my views firstly you asked have we got the game plan right well I don't think any of us are here to play at this so I think you've got the tag line wrong with regard to the land drainage targeted rate our property is at 259 auto tapu road which is the southern west rural corner of the city three drains run across our land which carry all the water that leaves lansdowne valley minson's drain is part of the horseball drainage district it is managed by the drainage drainage district committee and maintained by aircam this meets jones creek on our property a natural waterway which is fed from properties in both the city and selwyn we also convey stormwater in an open drain from a good part of early valley road which also means water from both christchurch city and solwan and by implication the stormwater from further up also comes through the drone progresses past our home under oldhate road to the hausa river and eventually out to lake alismir we do significant maintenance ecan we understand from the count we understood from the council's letter that the proposed rate change would see the existing rates reapportioned to achieve a more distributed financial responsibility the letter was difficult and ambiguous and we did not have very much time to research further research since submission has clarified that the hallswood drainage district as I understand it is not even included in the proposal and that an additional rate will be charged to us that doesn't relate to our water at all um I therefore withdraw my support and urge further clarification and consultation on this matter I draw your attention carrying on old taita for road to the fact that this road is not included in any plan for cycle way and is extremely dangerous and should be prioritized in the ten-year plan um and this again raises the issue of the christchurch city soul and boundary you can't ignore it safety has to come first finally a comment on heritage the owners of the arts centre took responsibility for their heritage buildings and they restored them competently and without question I it is an iconic asset for our past for our future and its restoration has contributed significantly to the mental health of a recovering city the robert mcdougall gallery had the potential to do this the council has full ownership and responsibility under an act of parliament to care for this building and it has woefully reneged on this responsibility during discussions with one of your councillors and following a very positive meeting with senior staff interested parties including myself were assured that the council was committed to the restoration of the robert mcdougall that is to restoring its original built form into its reinstatement as an art gallery I am fully aware of the technical relationship of the category one listed building to its neighbor the museum as I read it this plan proposes waterproofing in 2023 which makes no sense at all the base isolation a necessary requirement to quite literally support the canterbury museum the council closed the gallery long before the quake it has cost it has a costed scope of works and an expert heritage assessment in its position for many years there appears to this suggests that the gallery will remain closed allowed to languish and become increasingly derelict for a total of 30 years thank you just on that final point I will say that the reason for canvassing opinion on the base isolation was that we were we that was the resolution that was carried in the last um or the previous annual plan that we would we would actually um uh consult on that as part of the redevelopment proposal of the museum so it's part of a connected redevelopment project yeah I think I made it clear that I understand that yeah right did I miss anything in the 10-year plan for restoration of the robert mcdougall no well it comes into the museum then so it would still be in the ownership of the council but with the base isolation it becomes part of the museum redevelopment plan so yes it would be redeveloped as part of that plan but it would only be used for the purposes set out in the legislation so I draw your attention then to the other part of my submission I make ahead yes okay that's brilliant thank you very much thanks right now we've got a um we had a 15-minute adjournment schedule for this time so
Our next one is alistair price welcome thank you thank you for allowing me to speak there are many issues that I'd like to talk on however the issue I'm going to address is the question of the proposed water charges as this will have the biggest cost impact on our housing I currently have an allowance of 1 386 litres of water per day I currently pay 609 for water connected based on my property valuation per annum in new zealand the average person uses 227 liters of water per day that is about 600 liters per household per day this is not allowing for watering gardens washing the car etc the council is planning for every household to have an allowance of 700 liters per day and I simply say is that fair the council is intending to charge usage over three monthly cycles based on the numbers above I will be paying 2.39 per cubic meter whether I use water or not I cannot accrue from one period to the next if in any three-month window period I exceed the average of 700 liters per is the council aware a garden hose on full pressure will use between 500 and 800 liters per hour we do have different water pressure over christchurch my area is around about 50 down on the central city the older areas have a lot more pressure why if I fill up my car with 91 petrol I pay exactly the same amount whether I have a two hundred thousand dollar car or a five hundred dollar car water should be treated the same the proposed water charging scheme has been poorly thought through and is a win-win for the council finances regardless it does not create water conservation across the whole city as a number like apartments will not be impacted by the changes water has to be paid for please treat all right pies equally we must all pay the same please scrap the water connected based charges on capital value let's just pay for the water we use no more no less please consider how selwyn council charges water as an example 254 dollars of fixed fee per annum and 50 cents I repeat 50 cents per do have ideas on how such a plan could be implemented without affecting the council's cash flow because obviously this is going to have an impact time constraints prevent me from preventing that here thank you could I offer you the invitation if if you have got time to put that in writing to submit that as a supplementary and we will accept that as a supplementary submission with that detail um attached would that be yes I've got a spare copy here now but I can get it in electronic form that'd be fantastic thank you very much and thank you for your time next is uh
Uh and now we move on to the wider submissions and the first one up is tori pete who's here um this time with the summit road protection authority hat on and tim is going to sit back from the table as a member thank you okay right good afternoon um I will keep this short and sharp as you've seen the submission it is fairly blunted to the point um and what the protection authority is asking is that the port helps the management plan get um activated and and move forward in the fact that we had fires that has been undone we even had um a hearing panel back in 2018 we're getting the closure of the summit road and from that we've had um movement from the council to say that it is a priority that the management plan be advanced as soon as possible we'd like to see that from the protection authority as a priority and and be moved forward and resourced where it is needed these plans do capture much needed um resources and sorry not as well like I said it is just a needed document so that we can all move to a greater focus point sorry and here for questions basically I don't mind whichever suits you but um it's probably best that you just sit back tim because um I mean yeah you can you can assist us behind the scenes yeah there is the three of us as part of the authority and that is through delegations from the council so that there's member from from two community boards and from salon as part of the authority yeah okay does anyone have any questions no uh melanie just with the import hills management plan I here's some of it's been started you said that didn't you so as if staff said why they haven't prioritized it is it just that there's no enough results there's not enough resources and at the moment we've heard that there's none of resources within council so they're actually um from what I understand outsourcing that document um purely because we just haven't got the it is something that is needed um all reserves by by right have to have reserve management plans and under that needs to be um that needs to be under port hill's management plan right okay anymore that's it thank you very much much appreciated good luck thank you our next
And thank you both for coming in thank you for your time thank you thank you and uh now we have the um spreading cashmere community board carolyn crocker good god now I'll go in the driving suit okay sorry lee I didn't_''_32.559 I didn't mean to ignore you as well so um thank you are you leading this one off as the no he's sitting next door to the technology okay mr technology over to you chair carolyn ah kia ora tarteau and thank you for having us it's great to hear the projects enjoyed and joy's other boards have had in the last few years in terms of projects and things and things in the awards our board does not suffer from fomo it has ammo we miss out and uh like pendleton we've had very in all the years I've been on the board we've had no major projects other than the ones that are in all the boards like cycleways our commitment to notwithstanding that we haven't mentioned it at length our commitment to disability access and the very strong climate change program remains and it remains important to us it's heartbreaking the lack of progress on disability access we continue to do make mistakes and make our buildings and our structures in inaccessible to people with disability and I wish we did not um I i want to briefly mention the adult playground that is in our proposals we think that this is a margaret mayhe that the kind of magic proposal that makes the city great and we would like to be able to discuss that at length and we have a a program on the board where it's being examined for adviability we oppose the cuts to our contributions to our community this is the face of the city council for many people in our community this is what they know about the city council as those small contributions to the welfare of their people through organisers organizations the not-for-profits who do the wonders in our community and this is the engagement between the council and its people are very much through these volunteers and not-for-profit organizations and we are opposed mention before we start the staff we've had a very um we've had quite a lot of turmoil in terms of um staff leaving and coming over the last 18 months and the staff is now seems to be settled down and they have been wonderful in the preparation for the ltp and all the other work that we've been doing recently and we'd like to thank them personally for that selwyn street and we're taking asreed that you've read our document of the long term plan submission and we're just going to mention some highlights the selwyn street the master plan was approved in 2013 and was scheduled for the financial year 2016. they commenced the design in 2016. engagement in consultation took in consultation took place in 2016 feedback was received and the changes made to the design and response 2017 the annual plan delayed construction until 2020 the 2018 ltp again delayed instruction until 2022 the draft ltp now proposes to further delay construction until 2027. we so admire um woolston and the progress that's being made there woolston has been stuck um for the whole 12 years and 11 years since the earthquake with the only changes in the time that has happened and except for decay of buildings the only thing else that has happened is that we've built cages for pedestrians to cross a very busy crossing so that they can be safe and that's the only thing we've done the board requests that the 781040 budget is brought forward to the financial year 2023 this would align with the work waka kotahi new zealand ta is doing on brahm street which is expected to get underway in late 2022. we also note the small budget that was allowed for the reserve was taken away from us and given to naval point for reasons that we do not understand and was never discussed with us okay um appreciating that you just sat for an hour listening to people asking for money for projects and but if you listen to one thing I say today if you do just please listen to this and we see um we honestly think you've got this and we're really privileged to have the major cycle networks um the northwest arc and the power hoe river network when that comes to fruition but they're going to come to a stunting end at the moment opposite princess margaret hospital we've unfortunately created some island communities in terms of westmoreland craycroft the increased traffic flow on kashmir road is just unnavigatable and so we've we've essentially disconnected our communities from their schools from their key activity centers so it is so important that we invest at the moment council has got money in this 10 years out and well the first of the schemes for the local connections is 20 20 90 sorry sorry 2029 um we think you've got it wrong there's so many reasons why you should be bringing this program forward whether it's climate change whether it's children's safety um please we're asking that you bring this forward to at least 2025 at the very latest and so many reasons I i could I could talk for a long time on this one so our south west the ministry of ed has told us they're not going to build another secondary school we've had parents coming to the board now for over 18 months asking for links in the cycleways because especially along cashmere road which is going to be downright dangerous with the thousands of houses being built in the hallsville area thank you yeah um hunhay community centre this is a very small but lovely and loving building that used to be a children's library and carries the atmosphere with it it has a large section we have great celebrations on this land including easter and christmas carols and so on the community want to be able to make the survival center sprayden and hoon hey have very few bumping places for people to meet and talk to one another and um this is we and this we hope to be it to be one of them we'd like to make it viable we'd like the disposal of centennial hall to go away to get to go ahead sorry and the money from that which is already allocated okay we're going to go back onto the road in an infrastructure this is the cashmere barrington roundabout um it's a major convergence point and you would have heard me talk about this in the past and it looks quite idyllic in that photo I've got to say but it doesn't look we've took a a couple of recent site visits there it's like wacky races at 8 30 in the morning um you've got it's a major convergence because you've got pure air reserve you've got early clark you've got the river corridor so you've got pedestrians that feel like they've got a real low priority so what we're asking there um is that that gets that is maintained for 2020 and and that we we instigate those pedestrian safety improvements I really I don't want to go on about this week I really hope this is a given I really do because it's really needed by our community and when the um when we asked our traffic people to prioritise safety in top this roundabout and access from north south and south north this was the one that they put at the top and it's been a very useful method that we've done over the last couple of years is to ask our traffic people to give us a safety priority and this year it was that and community grants um I am just going to briefly echo what my my colleagues and peers have said and we we don't agree with a five percent reduction um our staff and community board members we make that those funds as lastic as they can be and beyond elasticity to be honest we stretch them as far as we can please don't pitch us against communities of need like rowley uh like addington please don't put us in that position where we have to choose and all of that money goes to the right places and it's really well used so please listen to us thank you and finally for us we oppose any reductions to opening hours collection purposes purchases furniture and equipment budgets and staffing for not-for-profits being a liaison between council in the community libraries is ahead of them these are our safe places this is the places and buildings that nurture people with mental health issues may be homeless and people who are in other words not fitting into society or are lonely or are missing out in life this these libraries are the places that sustain them keep them going nourish them and look after them and the cutting of and they are also libraries are the most valued by the community time after time any survey comes out with libraries being the most valued and to cut their to cut their income and to cut their expenditure is very much the wrong thing to do thank you thank you all right well that is exactly 10 minutes so the timing is perfect so thank you very much both of you for presenting today and um for highlighting the key issues in your area much appreciated thank you thank you and now
Great thank you thank you all right so now I'll move that we um resolve the um now that I've moved that we exclude the public for the reasons set out in the um agenda um do I have a seconder for that um james daniels all those in favor say I against that's carried you
Submission really appreciated thank you uh the next one is um te pataka o rakai hote uh banks peninsula community board tori pedden I think I saw tyron fields in the background as well welcome good afternoon everyone thank you for the opportunity to for us to speak to our board submission first laser board we understand there are financial restraints going forward we appreciate the need to keep the rates increased to a minimum however we feel in some areas the level of service needs to be maintained land drainage charges even though we understand the need the mechanism in which these have been introduced is not quite right and the calculations are not quite right either we ask for a one-year deference to better consult and get the right balance much like you did with the excess water targeted rate facilities one of your own strategic policies is enabling active and connected communities to own their future my point here is connected communities removing a service centre from the most remote community goes directly against your own strategic policy the community of akara have noticed the level of is not acceptable to them or us as a board having the service centre use use measured on financial transactions alone is not all of what a service centre provides there's a face for the council it is somewhere residents can go and ask the tricky questions there's a hole in the footpath can we get it fixed I hear there's a consultation coming out can you tell me more about that we want to put a water tank to hold rain water what consents do I need from the council and who do I speak to it is often hard to navigate a website when you're not sure where to start management plans we have many reserves in banks peninsula area and each of those reserves needs a management plan but what we are lacking is an area plan in which these reserves these reserve plans sit under a port hills management plan and a bank's peninsula management plan are both required I understand work has started on these we ask resources be given to these as a priority while I'm on management there's a need for a destination management plan yes banks peninsula is a great destination and local national and international visitors will continue to visit however over the past few years we've noticed great strain on our infrastructure and community that is why we feel it is important to have a destination management plan lastly from me before I head over to tyrone community funding please do not decrease this as is a very valuable asset to our communities our communities make that small amount of money stretched so far and they will miss that anything else from you oh kilter and I absolutely support everything tourists of course um just a couple of quick notes um so our board absolutely um does not support the uniform annual general charge and we're unanimous on that um and in terms of just the the management plans for for reserves um out on the peninsula we do have have had a number of um of uh fires out in the port hills and and beyond in recent times and we're really concerned about that from uh from an we really want to see some some good work done then because you know we're not really asking for any additional funding as it were outside of the big ticket items that we that we um that's been on that have been on the council's radar for some time um what we're really asking for a lot of the time is operational efficiency um that enables us to deliver a better environment and offering um from the peninsula which is for economic well-being and in the broader sense of the word and um you know and not just for our communities but for everyone in christchurch so we of course advocate for our communities we advocate for the environment and what's really important on the peninsula is that you know uh we have um six hapu with manufenua over over our our board area um that's really important to us we have format ideas so we're really advocating for the strength of the relationship between council and our treaty partners and so just want to finish off by saying the peninsula is an asset because by doing that it gives our city better economic returns and the true sense of um an economy and I think that you know if a councillor say happen to have a bachelor in nakado we want to make uh his or her life as as wonderful as possible um for that visit um to the peninsula and kyoto that's that's I think us in a nutshell I think we've covered most in the submission do we have any um andrew thank you just going back to one of the first comments you made on the um land drainage charges you're asking for a deferral of implementation of this for a year so they can be further consideration can you just expand a little bit on what you think needs to be further considered or what unintended outcomes you think there might be from the current proposal we've heard from some of the farmers in the area that that will affect properties quite significantly as in what might only affect small rural properties in a minor way some of these larger properties that be thousands and thousands of dollars out of pocket so um as we did right in our submit right in our submission that should you plant it in native forest and the value of your property go up you are not actually gaining any money from that property so therefore it's almost a disincentive for our for landowners to to plant us rather than you know another means because the costs of their rates are going to increase exponentially I think the mathematics are a very blunt instrument like there could be a lot more nuance and sophistication in the way it's calculated to to ensure a more equitable outcome for residents on the peninsula the way it's done at the moment is is kind of just sort of right there you go um you know sort of the when it when it starts scaling up it actually starts to become quite inequitable and being one of the residents that actually received the letter about the land drainage charge we only received it two weeks before the end of the submissions period so it actually came after was printed so that was quite hard for residents to understand the ramifications of what this charge is let alone time to to give feedback to it so that is another thing that has come back to me and I mean I've known that myself so so was it um easily understood when you received that individual communication or was it was that was it quite complex it's hard for me to answer that because I already knew some background about that but I didn't have to pretend you weren't the chair of the community yeah um I think there is still some grey area that needs further explanation um because I mean our neighbours had to put in land drainage mechanisms when they built their property only in the last couple of years and so now they've got to pay a land drainage charge but they've had to fork out 25 000 for you know stormwater runoff to be dealt with and they're sort of going while we're now getting charged again we've had to put this extra into have come directly to me from my neighbours that's good melanie sam um I was going to ask about these different properties for disposal that you've indicated some of them um looking like people weren't made of land but there'd be other are the users seen for all of these all five of them for the first few in diamond harbor in the past so last term the board did see a use and there is some reasons why we want to hold on to that for now until there is a few things dealt with i.e the reserves if they can be actually stated as reserves some other parts of land further down the list are on the christian checkered highway where are just landlocked bits of land that have been grazed at the moment so for me and the board we found that the process is not the right to be put into an ltp it needs to be put as a standalone and that's what the residents of diamond harbor are raising as well that there's a concern they haven't own merit the board's taken a lot of looks at a lot of those pieces of land over a long period of time and this is you know where it is now is probably the right outcome okay okay sam yeah thanks um very much good good presentation in terms of the echo of service center stuff um and I think it was quite good how you talked about the you know the front-facing element of that and the need for in the community do you and just drop my mirror do you know what the the usage was or the patronage on a daily basis monetary wise no no no like people going on we we have still not been received those for those numbers they only took the numbers of of financial transactions that's why we said that's that's not a good snapshot to capture how many people go into those service centres because that's all they had was the financial transactions but it's it's low and we're always going to be on the back foot because of because of know it's really about you know a citizen of christchurch and nakado being able to access the same services as a citizen of christchurch um yeah you know that's good it might be useful if someone can take it offline and get it yeah and we'll get that but also the delivery through the library in the meantime so there will be some because there are alternatives aren't there to they they are looking at numbers at the moment and we we did ask from a community board to get the other numbers that are not just financial transactions but other transactions that perhaps go through a service desk right okay um well that brings us to the 10 minutes so look thank you very much for your submission and thank you both for coming thank you for your time thank you thank you
The next one we have is the waimado um pendleton waimari hillwood community board bridget williams thank you so much councillors and mia for um letting the uh the board speak to its submission for the ltp and I just want to say that deputy chair david cartwright would be here with me today but I've just been told that he has two flat tyres and I have photo evidence uh to confirm that that is true so I will with regards to them with regards to um have we got the right game sorry have we got the game plan right um through to disposal of council-owned properties I will take the submission as read regarding those elements I think it's quite clear within our submission what our position is and in the best interest of time I would like our board to speak to the capital projects and some of the other community projects as well that has come through community organizations and residents so our board has always been acutely aware of the need to be financially prudent with spending in order to keep rates not come to council each year with a long wish list of projects they would like to have funded over the past 10 years our board has only asked for five capital projects to be considered for funding through annual plans and long-term plans two of those projects remain on our list of requests for this coming ltp that is bishopdale toilets and gardner's road footpath so the other two um we have been yes sorry I'll keep going so as the councillors will be aware each board has developed their community board plans which identified key projects the board want to achieve during its three its three-year term and the development of these priorities was done with input from our local communities and residents so out of the nine priorities our board has identified two have already been completed and two are currently underway utilizing our own resources and partnership with the local community so the two that have been commun um completed is the caretakers house which was um demolished at burnside park um also the big belly bins so our ward contributed 16k our community be put out into different parks around the ward and then the two that are ongoing as safety initiatives and car parking on rustly road the remaining five priorities will require some financial support from council which we are asking the council to consider for inclusion for this long-term plan and they are the augmentation of island stream so this is reinstating the island stream and fixing the water flow issues so the board has worked with council staff and the local community to look at ways to address the issue staff have provided a response back to the board indicating that the only viable option would be the installation of a new board at crosby park the estimated cost of this is one sorry a hundred and thirty thousand there is currently no budget allocated for this project and the board are requesting the council include this project and the ltp the other is the upgrade of the toilets and changing room facilities at nunwick park so this is a highly utilized facility and the toilets and sports storage facility at this park was constructed in the late 1980s board is keen to investigate whether the building is still fit for purpose and the feasibility of building new changing room facilities there's the construction of a shared cycle pedestrian footpath on gardner's road between sawyer's arms and wilkinson's road so this is an area of the city that is experiencing growth and there is currently no footpath or safe cycling space from wilkinson's road to sawyer's arms road and a shared path would greatly improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists particularly children who bike to school we also have the replacement of the public toilets at bishopdown mall so this is a long-standing request we've asked this for many years and the board's preference would be for a new stand-alone toilets to be built on the land where the old plunket rooms were recently demolished and we also finally have the development of the council-owned land adjacent to tullot park into additional playing fields for the club the board would like to request that staff investigate the opportunity to extend the playing area of the park by developing the council-owned will see in our submission in addition to our board plan priorities we are also seeking support towards a couple of other projects that the community has asked us to advocate for on their behalf so there is the retention of the pedestrian cycleway through ministry of education land on island road and since we wrote our submission I'm very pleased to be able to update the council and thanks to sarah pallett that um who has been collaborating with us on this is that the ministry of education have reconsidered their decision and they are now looking to include the retention of this path and their new development however they are keen to look at a partnership with council where they would cover the cost of the construction of the path but would seek council support to provide the lighting there's also the belfast netball club so the border supporting the submission from the club regarding bringing forward the repairs to the courts the funding for this project is not allocated until 2027 and we agree with the club's request that this work needs to happen for the court users and then we also have right turning arrows at key intersections in our board area so as you will see in our submission residents have requested the installation of right turn arrows at a number of different intersections in our board area and the board is keen to work with the transport unit to help prioritise these intersections which brings me to one of the other elements that we raised at the start of our submission which is the board would strongly recommend that the council assign to each board an appropriately sized maintenance budget in the delegation and the delegation to prioritize the maintenance needs in their local communities we think this is something that the board can definitely assess with it can help streamline the process and of course allows residents to get to know how their board can advocate for them further so thank you so much for listening that is our submission happy to take questions thanks very much can I just pick up that um uh pedestrian cycle path through the ministry of education land I was thrilled to see that at the new school merger site and this was an issue that was raised with us there so really pleased to see that do you have any idea what the cost of lighting is and whether we did we did we currently put the lighting in for the current um cycle way through there oh I wouldn't be able to answer that and I couldn't ask our answer to what the cost would be but that is something that I'm sure we can you know we can follow up with stuff I just thought you might know off the top of you sorry sorry I had uh jake and well we'll see how we go with time um really quickly just looking at the the rates section of your submission um just wanted to know do you think we've got it sort of wrong with five percent or so to answer this I would say that the board recognises that the council is in a very difficult position when it comes to um how we're going to pay for things we have had it that our board would like to see a more transparent approach to the rate spend and that clearly measures the outcomes and improvements in operational services achieved as a result of the increased rates andrew and anne thank you um I don't think you mentioned it either in the written submission or in the verbal presentation does the board have a position on the proposed cuts to community funding either supportive or opposing of that so we would be in agreement with what has been said from other community boards and we believe the community is the backbone to a healthy society so we would be um we wouldn't want to see cuts being taken for those community groups so you oppose the um proposed cuts yes thanks bridget um interesting um your thought about bringing maintenance budget into community board control I suppose how do you see you know what would that cover if you have thoughts about that as a board I mean for our board the the issues that we're getting consistently are things to do with trees um right turn arrows um parking I suppose you know fingers on the pulse when it comes to issues in the community and I'm not exactly sure what that would look like but if that is something that could be explored as it could be a way to streamline those processes and allow communities to come to us and know that those areas that we can specifically assist and we have budget for and we know what that budget is yeah yeah the way I read it because I actually referred to the issue in my um star column which was essentially some were saying that that the community boards might be better at setting priorities for you know minor maintenance spend rather than you know we're not talking about major capital budgets but um uh rather than having to come back through council exactly yeah thank you yeah thank you you've talked about the maintenance but I guess I just wanted to be clear because in some of your response you talked about capital so would you like would you like us to think about also giving um a certain amount of know the capital priority projects within the awards as well uh that isn't something that we have discussed for that but for this particular issue around the maintenance it was more um it was your phrase finger on the pulse that's what I was attracted to that really summed it up well thank you yeah okay and that's I know I intervened because you come to the ten minutes so thank you very much for this um an incredibly thoughtful submission really appreciated thank you the next one
Thank you thank you uh next is uh waipuna um horseball hornby ricketton community board and uh we have um helen broughton deputy chairperson oh and mike laura cheer sorry I've got two different lists in front of me and one of you was on one and one of you was on the other so I'm going to read both now thank you the absence of their um submissions chair madame um helen is is joining me today thank you thank you all the already okay thanks very much for the opportunity to present our long-term plan report to uh to the to the council and had the opportunity to speak to this submission and we are the largest community board in new zealand and one of the fastest growing in in the city I would say and twenty interesting thing too 25 percent of the workforce in in otatahi christchurch actually work in in our ward so that's quite an influx in and out every day um of our area as well so um our board our priority um plan priorities are the local local network of a lot of lanes and streets in hallsville that that don't go anywhere the footpath goes along and stops so what we want is some better pedestrian linkages through the through the suburb than we've got now so there's not a lot of money involved in it's just um planning more than anything when there's new developments take place it's just a matter of making sure that those links are connected up to other to other areas and this is the big one the hornby center project and we want that delivered and um and increased budget hormone has been waiting for this for a long time and we want to really make sure that we can get it delivered um everything we want within the budget so that's quite critical so if the budget does blow out we do really really want to make sure that this project goes ahead and it was touched on before about um community funding there are a group of um associations in in the hornby area and and wider that are looking at funding their but there's not enough money in the budget to actually do that so it's really really good if people around the table here are aware that um that if we can get enough money from the community we would like that built as the building gets built so even if it's even if we know that the funding is coming in if you can just go ahead and incorporate that in the building and then the funding will be made returned back to the council so just keep that in mind and the local roading network in hornby is um has got insufficiencies in it and we just want to make sure that those flooding in you know in the intersection of chalmers amy's and and um shannon's road gets fixed it's been an issue for as long as I've lived in hornby it's an old pepperoni county council issue that we've inherited but now with the traffic volumes using that area it's very embarrassing when it rains that you've got to put out traffic cones and stuff and past helen you want to talk about the um 2.1.4 we'd like to get a connection between the elenor mosque and hagley park so that's just a small traffic treatment there um this is my area this I'm always nagging about this and I'm sorry but it doesn't get on on the order paper bradshaw terrace basically to try and summarise it went out for consultation in 2009 there was a mistake by the board we hadn't included it in in a local network uh went out for full consultation people replied then the earthquake came so so it got shelved it came back on onto the order paper for 2018 to 21 I think um and vicki buck was the councillor then who put it back on and it suddenly got dropped off there was no coming to us and saying it's dropped off it just dropped off and we're struggling to get it back on now I know it's going to be a challenge but it's the only street in that whole area that hasn't been done's about 500 000 to to in fact do it I i I won't_''_305.759 I won't labor that thank you helen do you want to go on about the general comments and and and rates 3.1.2 just comment on rates um obviously we're probably comfortable with where you are in rates at this point because there's a lot of challenges but we do ask that you try and hold rates in these coming years so it's the going forward that we are concerned about and we wonder if you can use the construction price index as as a sort of level of rates at the start of doing your next annual plan um because it does seem it's a cumulative effect that we've heard concerns about mike thank you I'm going back to what previous submitters have mentioned about the um about the five percent reduction in the in community grants funding programs you've heard from other community boards and you will hear from others as well as we go through this we really really really would like to have that funding for our communities to make them feel like communities and allow them to grow and and continue because if you think about but if you took all the community groups and organizations and volunteers out of our community you wouldn't have a community so that's a very very important part I think of the social interaction that we have in our city and any awards that's delivered through our community boards mike I think we should go on to that one yep okay helen yeah I'm just watching the times who jumped okay now I'm talking about the ricketton bus lounge we found it extraordinary that it was suddenly taken out of your budget we actually weren't told we just found it um so the background is good and I think it's appropriate to speak about this because it came in 2014-15 and there was a lot of opposition to it from business people and residents and to some extent the board itself we preferred a different location but council was adamant it was going to go on the southern side where's two bus exchanges almost opposite each each other um you've got expiry lease dates of 2005 and 2026 there's no guarantee that if you break the the lease that you will be able to find someone else to contract the lease to particularly on the southern side because a lot of businesses are closing up there I don't actually understand why it's been done so having been concerned at the start we're fully supportive of it staying they're clean but they're attractive and you've got westfield behind one bus exchange you've got young workers there finishing sometimes it's seven o'clock at night and going on a bus either into the town or on that to in fact hornby and I did have something in writing I don't know if people have got that I gave it to person at the front it it hasn't come through okay am am I able to ask if it's come through I can read it out if you like I can read it and it comes from can I the club the winding up of the road works on ricketton road and this came about august of of last year rickett road is the key public transport corridor with over eight 800 bus movements a day as well as linking people to ricketton as a destination the bus lounges on rickett road a very key connecting hub on ecan's network linking passengers to other services enable them to get to work and home from other areas of the city so we just questioned why why there is a wish to um to do that I want to move on now to um to uh 3.2.2 the land drainage targeted right the board shares the concerns of the hallsville residents regarding the proposed council land drainage charge changes noting that the residents of the hallswood river rating district currently pay an environmental canterbury charge for lane land drainage the proposed land drainage targeted rate would have the unintended consequence for those residents and possibly others in the city having to pay twice right this one I've and then we'll jump back have we got time oh okay a bundle in the figures but we just and I know the publicity around it has been brought up to everybody's intention but that's a hundred new 111 year old facility um that was put it was it was called the coronation pool it was put in the coronation of king george actually so it's been a facility in the area for many many years with the school blues school pools closing around the area as well it's just an ideal situation so please please please don't knock it down don't close it down come to an arrangement with community groups and organizations to keep that running okay thank you well that's a very sound note to finish on um the offer for the community to take it over that's a very um something that we certainly will be considering thank you very much for your time and your consideration that you are going to give to our board submission thank you very much thank you and thank you for all of the effort you put into the detail of it thank the waimararo um pendleton waimea
Good morning and welcome to our finance and performance meeting if I can get people to take their seats and I'll open the meeting moriola so we'll start with item one apologies and I've got an apology from councillor major for absence which is moved by sam and seconded by jimmy chen all those in favor say aye against that's carried declarations of interest um we obviously have a number of councillors who sit as directors on the boards of various organizations um that we're considering um draft statements of intent today um so that's cchl christchurch nzed and venues otatahi um so those are noted I'm not aware of any other declarations of interest for the meeting today but if anything does come up as we move through the agenda please let it be known item three confirmation of previous minutes I'm happy to move those previous minutes do I have a second at james daniels all those in favor say aye against as and then we've got two supplementary reports that we need to include in today's agenda in the meeting I'm happy to move that we do so jake mcclellan will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried so then moving to item four public forum no public forum items today item five deputations no deputations today item six presentation of petitions no petitions today so then moving to item seven the performance exceptions report now peter I'll get you to make some introductory remarks in just a moment but first to say that this is the first time that we've seen this report updated with the recent results from the resident satisfaction survey and the point of contact survey now both of those surveys are going to be reported in a formal sense to counsel at the council meeting on the 13th of may that will be the opportunity for any detailed questions on those surveys the survey methodology the survey results and any of the trends and so on that those are showing so anything that's specifically about the surveys or the survey results those questions would be rightly directed to that meeting the 13th of may questions around performance exceptions including those that have been updated by the survey results but anything about the survey specifically um we'll be referring to the council meeting on the 13th of may when the report on those surveys comes in front of council so with that said peter welcome to the table and I'd welcome any introductory remarks that you've got on this report and thank you and good morning just to clarify the purpose of this report again it's to report high-level results against performance goals the more detailed analysis follows in the finance and project management reports um the the top line of service delivery is that it's stable it has been since basically october last year we're sitting at about 82 and a half percent of levels of service successfully delivered out of looking for about 85. now the show's not over that's only a couple uh that could take us to to success and there are some that are hanging in the balance so we may end up at 85 yet these results as the chair has of levels of service the bottom line of that is that those that went the wrong way uh netted off by those that went the right way and there's been a negligible effect overall on the overall result um obviously every year there are a certain percentage that where there's a decline there's a certain percentage where there's an increase and basically they net out this year um it's also worth noting that there are some levels of service that are affected still affected by covert um obviously attendance and visits at things like the art gallery are going to be affected by the lack of international visitors so the positive there is you may note if you look at previous years the volatility involved the forecasting this year is spot on the managers are really on top of what they're doing they have their forecasts have proven to be very very accurate to the point where even the resident survey which is a somewhat subjective feedback from the public their forecasts have been accurate there as well so um it's good to forecast to put in front of you um non-ltp levels of service which are more detailed and management oriented are actually quite a lot higher than this so that's just a piece of context um moving on to the watch list capital projects uh you'll get a more detailed report but overall we're looking at uh 80 for a target of 90 on major watch lists uh watch us projects bearing in mind that that's a view of the watch list based on whole of life not just the current year you'll get details of specific exceptions and project exceptions in ruth's report to follow the highlights are pointed out there and any changes from the original baseline and the ltp so for both in short for both watchless projects and levels of service we're running close to target uh we still have almost a quarter of a year left uh so it's hard to predict exactly where it will land but this will be reasonably close to where it will end following that there are some uh management comments on levels any commentary uh the the quality of those comments we're working on with the managers to make sure you get the right information in front of you there are very few surprises in there they're consistent with previous months if there are questions on any of those I'll attempt to answer them or the manager can answer them if they're present or we can if they're detailed questions we can take them away and report back to you uh which is a protocol set up in previous meetings thank you and I mean it's interesting what causes a project to go red we've got saint albans community center pushed back by 12 days in the grand scheme of things minimal but that causes that to be shown as an exception so I mean that's just one example of how a very small change can result in something showing up in this report yes all right so um peter thanks for the introduction um happy to take any questions on this other other questions on this report no questions all right in which information provided in the report jimmy will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you thank you so item eight the capital project performance report ruth welcome to the table thank you um and again if we can take any headline or introductory comments before we move to questions um and again noting that you've got um heads of service available you've got appropriate managers available to be talking to their areas and also answer any questions on their particular areas as well cool thank you good morning everyone so the report in front of you status is at march uh this year there is an update on the slide in front of you also available on the hub that shows our april status just bearing in mind that all april actuals are not yet in so focusing on our core program up there on the left hand side on the top left olive council we are forecasting a delivery of 358.4 against the 376.8 that would give us a result of 95 spend against budget or a carry forward of 18.4 key delivery units also to indicate what they are forecasting to deliver against their core program our above the line projects at the bottom left there parakiori and cmua as you know these are delivered by third parties uh the forecasts that we receive uh are reflected directly in our system from them so we have no influence on those forecasts uh spin to date so an update on the march spend because at the time of writing within the report it noted that spend was at 94 delivery units achieved 97 to the end of march and as of today with april not yet closing delivery units have spent 82 of their forecasted spend so that would bring us a total spend to date of 306 across all of capital or 2.8.9 against the core program so in our final months just a reminder that june is a double month of spend so we accrue all june costs within june so that they're captured in the financial year that the work has been completed so that means we have three months of spend remaining so we have 109 so I'll be asking the delivery units to come up one at a time to speak to their forecasts remaining for your reference and the papers that you have refer to pages 44 and 46 showing the breakdown of each month they'll be speaking to that and you'll also note that in those slides this month you can see the change from their previous month forecast so firstly transport so they're forecasting a remaining spend of 43 million and last year they spent 37 million in may and june sorry lynette can talk today you have a blessing I have a voice this month thank you good morning everyone um so as as last month we have a number of um large con large projects under contract and under construction there's a number of cycleway contracts out there um on south express norway's dark heath get um not heathcote rappanui three that are underway in working we are looking to get a couple of small bits of northern line off the key rail corridor started so they're being they're being worked on has been contracted kashmir hoon haye weasley's has been tended um I'm going to a tender session later this morning about coastal pathways so there's a lot more work under contract than we were in the same position last year so that's why we have the confidence to spend next three waters so they're forecasting a remaining spend of 52 million last financial year three waters spent 30 million in may in june stella hello everyone my name is talat last year we were forecasting and achieved less because our curve was front loaded and we had lots of construction projects which were tapering down from last year but this time we have done all the hard work and we have done all the procurements and the projects are coming into construction every week every month so that's why we are forecasting more 52 million in in the last months and most of them are from the regulation projects big big reticulation project which are 35 in numbers and in next month they all will be in construction so it's a easy spend thank you I have any particular question I will do that we'll come to questions um all together at the end I think and then finally darren with community forecasting a spend of five million uh last year they also spent five million um I've got to shift five million in the next three months um imminently achievable it's a portfolio of 143 projects from the ground up that's that's the community portfolio the five million dollars aggregates around about half a dozen projects um final accounts on sonorban's community centre the edmond band rotunda um we're doing a million dollars worth of hard surface paving in the botanic gardens at the moment that'll be cleared by the end of the financial year and some significant work at the pioneer pool so I can see where the money's going to come and um with the reforecasts there um imminently achievable and the time to run thank you thanks and then finally major facilities we don't have aleister in the room at the moment behind you right here thank you hi forecasts for the next few months yep so um the issues that we've had obviously with regard to metro sports facility itself and also the cmua metro sports is forecasting some we're based the forecast is based on their productivity and we've we are presented the figures and we input the figures according to the uh project delivery um team being cpp and otakuro and we know that there are some substantial sums to be met um and they're looking highly unlikely that they'll meet those uh with the june figure being 10.4 million at the moment uh which is an unknown really in the christchurch market but uh we'll see if they get there eventually the second part would be cmua and we all know that cmua b6 wattpack have been appointed um with them being appointed we're now starting to see a forecast come from them and we've started geotech work and we're and we're deep into the design teams at the moment and we're expecting the first invoice which will be around about 2.5 million so and the spend profile being met so and we expect that to be the same for the next 12 months so confident with that cool um I'll just call out a couple more things and then go to questions so uh the watch list report page 62 our charm street brick barrel project had practical completion in april there's just some final resurfacing works to be completed this week and then the external funded report page 65 our norwest ark cycle routes section 1a 1b and 1c are also now complete I'll take any questions potentially with the major facilities I'd recommend that any specific questions relating to those portfolios be taken later on the agenda we've got the uh update from alistair later on great thank you so ready to take questions now thanks ruth just on page 42 when we talk about the three waters and there's actual savings there of 10 million because of um oh what does it say oh just beautiful competitive low prices confirming tenders now underneath that it looks at um purchasing land for stormwater activity and the 10 million or is that stormwater land purchases already budgeted for leaving us with a real surplus yeah the latter so the land purchase is already part of the forecast so three waters are currently looking for opportunities to accelerate projects to bring them back to fill in that 9.4 million great that's good news thank you can I comment on that um yeah don't certainly so unusually you'll hear me say this um pauline is that for once it's a good thing that we have nine million because actually we're getting sharper prices and that's a good thing to means we can be recycling the money into elsewhere thank you jimmy the former future purchase from overseas the postal country expansion weather will impact those delivery in may of 2022 green hello it's all green it's all going for may 22._``_2692.4 we've received already received what's material material purchase material from australia we're not we're not purchasing that material carry roll or purchasing that material but we are looking to go to uh tinder soon as is growing on track yes I understand they have a full material purchase from the overseas to australia to from italy a period of time I just want to know update status our project manager is working with kiwi rail to understand that and is reporting in this report that things are on track to do to meet the requirements and to make these time frames okay second is the page 63. what update status multicultural recreation and the community center this one there's a green this green but I'm not sure whether I have any other progress or not there's uh so what was the question jimmy sorry no question update status the progress at the moment is it sits with the governor's team at the moment because they're still working through and negotiating the next steps if you will so we've been we were allocated the project to look at what we could do um across with the property itself and then what we could do across the portfolio and see where we could slot changes needing to be made into the selves regardless to the next steps from a governor's perspective so that's the update that I can give you the money's still in play we're just not spending any of that money at all at the moment yeah but in here you know your signal is still green in my my my view is a little bit uncertain it should be there there's no uncertainty it's no uncertainty it's about consultation that's all so it's just the next steps we're just going through a process john's leading that process and I'll get john to give you an update okay okay last question okay on page the 67 the crown regeneration acceleration fund for 40 million dollars I'm not sure except these five projects you know total investigate for 10 million have any the projects in relation to the southwest area particular postwar in the holmby area because those are traffickers you know transition is quite quite serious I'm not sure whether I have any other project in relation to so the craft the craft money yeah to council and there's five geographic areas and money for safety projects and pt projects the geographic areas um there's a halls wall no there's a rickard and rickett and geographic area that is covered with the works and that's that's underway as per everything we've discussed previously yeah but but my concern but how about the horse when the homie area knows the traffic boy this has all integrated this has all been agreed previously so there were previous decisions of council which determined the priority areas so staff are obviously then working on projects within the areas that we previously that we previously as governors decided would be the priority areas and then was put into the business case which was submitted to central government which is what they have signed off and therefore we need to deliver in the areas that have been agreed absolutely okay thank you thank you thank you any further questions yeah um thank you just just on page 60 um right at the top we've got the naval point development plan where they said the I don't know if that's a typo or um and then it's got the approved delivery date january 2027 but given that we've got the sale gp and we've made a sort of commitment to do stuff is that does that need to be updated or have a separate um section just so we can have confidence that the facilities will be ready in time the um the adopted master plan is envisaged to be delivered over that period of time over that 10-year time frame or thereabouts the piece of work we're doing now the carve out to create the car park to allow the sail gp event to take place yeah is moving at pace um and we'll have that complete by christmas um the date for the total project completion I think sounds about right six to seven years out what was that 20 27 27 27. look I'll have a look at that for next time but it's certainly um that that's the way the money is sequenced in the ltp that will be delivering um time okay so remembering this is by exception clearly it's important that uh it's I think it's right that you could just comment on the critical piece in relation to what needs to be done this year and if there is and we ask that that be done but that only be done if there is an exception issue that isn't being delivered if it's green and it's fine then it will be silent on it because that's the point my understanding from the last briefing we had there was an exceptional issue that we needed to think about well that's not coming through in this report so there you are that's the officer telling you we have we have budget and the ltp proposed to be able to deliver upon that master plan so that's what we work towards the the ltp bid based on qs costings and able to deliver everything that came through for approval when the naval point development plan um is currently proposed within the tenure ltp at 27 million I think was the number sure that we deliver in this first year specifically to the agreement that we have yeah like so my understanding was we came back and did some sort of substitution to find the additional funding that was required um that there were different options of things that we we could do different choices that we had based on the requirements and more work had been going into detailed design I might let andrew talk to that as it's his budget that we we're delivering on behalf of but the key thing I mean just in terms of the key concerns you'll recall that we presented to council um a more deep yeah it's been through a bit of a process there was the uh bid deadline that needed to be met and there were some early numbers that were put in front of council uh subsequent to that we came back with some more detailed numbers and there was an increase in budget required to deliver the component that you're talking about yeah and at that time we discussed options on how we could slide for the ltp and have no impact on the ltp across other projects so that that position hasn't changed right and as darren has pointed out yes there's lots going on in terms of negotiating how to move the project forward but it's on track there's no exception to report at this point in time okay um and I think the other thing I mean obviously we're keen to get the work done that needs to be done as a minimum but I think we also gave direction if there was opportunities to do more in a shorter time frame that that we would do we would look if you're referring to um in regard to the cell gp event yeah I mean just having these simply won't you won't have time to add elements that are not critical to that event but we're absolutely looking at efficiencies in terms of you know we're opening up the ground if it needs to go in now to support the long term that's happening great okay um just the other question cycleway project um sorry I'm just trying to find the page um it's listed as red it's the tannery two martindales um sorry the page 64. um so just just trying to quite kind of understand um obviously there's additional additional uh funding that's needed but when are we likely to see the detailed design I know we've lodged the consent have we got the consent approved or um what's kind of happening there we don't need consent for all of it right we need to consent for parts of it some of the consents are in and some of the approvals for working in um for easements and others are in so some of the work can go ahead others it's it's all being worked in parallel um it is still showing a I haven't got it on my roof it is still showing an overspend um the team and the construction crews are working to pull that back as much as they can it was higher than that a couple of months ago so we are back to you and ask to utilize the contingency that is the program level contingency that is sitting there so trying to do everything they can to pull that back and be more certainty on their costs before we come and ask to use other funds so do we know what the changes are that kiwi roll have required is that typical to all the other crossings as well uh yeah yeah it is around gates usually okay um let's use your own um pedestrian gates for the crossings right and um just end signals the final question on that project that says the cost associated with coming to terrorists being two-way um has that decision been made well effectively the decision there is still a report that has to come back to the community board but effectively the decision was made you were asked to go out we were asked to go out and reconsult the clarity on that reconsultation has shown to stick with the original decision from keep it two-way all right okay so but we're going to get a report back with that it okay all right thank you are there any further questions on this report mike thank you um just one thing uh two parts to it um it's good to see that the um level crossings roll cross crossings have been separated but there's no actual time frame in this I assume that's still 22. yes and that's obviously the full upgrade of them yeah sorry at the end of all of them yeah do we have a time frame for the interim solution um obviously that's quite a busy road at the moment I mean I've been digging for it yesterday I couldn't get that information so I'll have to come back to you on that one okay secretly thank you any further questions so I'm I'm happy to move the receipt of this report do I have a second sam mcdonald um all those in is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you now moving to item nine corporate finance report and we've got bruce for this one bruce welcome are there any um introductory remarks that you'd like to make yes good morning councillors there's nothing nothing significant to see in this report in terms of treasury all positions are within policy limits we've got 132 million dollars due for repayment next month which we've already pre-funded in september october so we have the funds on hand to do that in terms of general debt there was an increase but it was largely due to billing the crown for the next installment of the multi-use arena which was paid has been paid in april in terms of rates death there's been a continuing decline in rate step down to 19.7 million at the moment two million of that is prior year's arrears the balance of 17.7 is current year's arrears so that's trending in the right direction as well um that's about all I've got to say if there's any questions happy to take them yep all good um thank you for that are there any questions on this report all right so I'm so sam you those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you and bruce staying with you for item 10 the financial performance report for the nine months ended 31st march any commentary on this one yes in december we reported to you a a optimistic forecast position for operating result of 6.2 million that has steadily improved over the last quarter months on month we're currently looking at a significant surplus of 19.1 million in fact I've just seen the april forecast as 22.1 million um so there's been a we're looking potentially at a very good financial position this this year in terms of optics um it's driven by a number of things some of it is covert related some of it relates to us being slightly conservative in our budgeting because of covert that looks at things like facilities revenue where we were slightly conservative and the revenue has been better than we expected um subvention credits we didn't expect any this year or the next two years we've re-looked at that and we received a 2.2 million subvention future as well so that's positive you know about the ccho dividend parking revenue is probably the one detractor that is down slightly in a city parking outside of covert there's things like these consenting volumes where we predicted a slowdown in consenting due to a supposed recession in fact where our consenting revenues and associated expenses are significantly higher than we expected there was the extension of the burwood landfill which has generated additional revenue partly offset by some costs at the same time we've had quite a tight control on our costs in fact our costs are forecast to be slightly under budget this year they've been well managed there are some costs as I mentioned that are up around consenting and build landfill there were some savings in the recycling and organics area around the way in terms of volumes being down and the way those were handled so as I say very good forecast financial position and that will have a positive impact potentially on next year's rates in terms of the ltp in terms of capex I won't_''_3670.48 report you've had from ruth so I've been open to questions excellent I mean I think the key message is that this is a good news story that 22.1 million surplus as noted in paragraph 4.3 of the report will go to debt reduction is greater than the residual covert debt that was planned to be drawn down in the next financial year which means that there won't be a need to draw down any further covert debt um that obviously has a flow-on effect to the rates in year one of the ltp which is very positive so there's a lot of what you've just told us that um you know very positive information and does reflect good news both in this report but more particularly um for year one of the ltp and the rates impact so um thank you for being the bearer of good tidings um moving to questions are the questions on this report sam just a quick one thanks bruce I agree it's it's good news the only thing was in 4.3 um the interest expense overstatement currently in the draft that's out for consultation or that should actually read an interest over statement in the annual plan yeah didn't current using your plan okay cool yeah yeah so that's not and so not consult like we've already I guess what I was hoping was we'd get to the ltp and we've got more savings sorry figures in the ltp uh are correct they will improve slightly with the uh reduction in covert borrowing of course okay cool damn I thought we'd found another three million thank you yani um while I appreciate this is good news in terms of the budget I guess the two areas that I'm concerned about is the fact that we're under spent um in water maintenance of two million dollars this is on 5.4 and 5.3 roading for us timing of maintenance so two of the kind of key things that we're really concerned about and we're under spent um so given what we've you know we're discovering with some of the water issues that we've had spent the water maintenance budgets I was hoping helen was still here it might be a question that if we haven't got somebody in the room we can answer it now we need to take offline and provide information um by email yeah I mean I'm happy to get informations but I just would have thought at a higher level though where we've got um huge dissatisfaction with footpaths we've just had the report that shows you know a huge number of complaints around the condition and um denton um which I haven't seen this sort of close-out report what happened at denton um but also we know what happened in accorole we have seen that report around um you know things not not being done because of budgets and yet we're under spent so I guess I was just really interested in that high level how does something like that happen and as a system's in place so that we do spend that budget to ensure that we can address those priorities and I think there are you know things that we um doesn't understand necessarily mean that the work hasn't been done or does it mean the work has been done but it's cost less but then if we've got a surplus are there other projects that we could be bringing back to use that surplus if we're in a constrained environment where there's work that we naturally would be choosing to do if it was affordable so if we can pick that type of thinking up in the um written response back that would be helpful because um and underspend doesn't necessarily mean that the work hasn't been done it may be that it has been done but more cost effectively so I would add to that uh chair is that actually in the finance report where we have those things that uh council johansson is right in terms of questioning and he did this last time as well is that there is a specific comment in the finance report over something that might be perceived as not a good thing so what are the facts around it either that actually we we don't have enough staff or whatever the fee whatever the result is put it in the report so that he doesn't have to keep asking the question yeah great just the other thing I mean just um in the revenue really really good to see um the people time moana um and I think we've we've had have we had some information back on how that's performing I think we have haven't_''_3957.44 we around what we're expecting but um the reckon sport revenue is I didn't quite understand what it meant by due to the release of revenues from the balance sheet what is that just an accounting yeah effectively it is it's revenue that we've received in prior years that we haven't recognized right so it's being released from the balance sheet I'd sorry I'd have to look at the the reason for that what page is that um that's on page 91._._3983.52 thank you I can answer that it's to do with consenting and we hold the revenue there's always it's released because of issues around consenting and where the refunds have to be paid and there was just this year that prior year's revenue was released that's what that relates to all right with covet and memberships and things well not necessary but it's just a normal delay but um it's because if we release it all at once there's chances are if we have to issue credits there's a small refund all right okay thank you thank you no more questions james kiara bruce look I'm not just because it's been raised I just want you to confirm regarding hippune taiwana the hot pools I understood and as I say I haven't had a look in here um I understood that they're in profit they're forecasting a profit for the year whereas they were um budgeting for a loss of something like 700. is that right yeah sorry I didn't catch the the first part of the question maybe if you could repeat questions okay and keep just wanting to confirm it was raised about and whether or not what what the what was happening with it financially I understand that it's in profit when it was budgeted to make a loss of something like 700 thousand dollars is that right yeah I haven't_''_4075.119 I haven't got the I can't answer that question in detail sorry again that might be one that we'll answer um offline by way of um an email but certainly in the report um paragraph three fourth bullet point um is showing um higher revenues of 0.6 million so that's there in the report but it will be good to see how that's tracking against forecast yeah yeah so if we can get that information again just emailed around that'll be perfect so it's absolutely outperforming it's forecast but whether it washes its faces a different issue yeah so outperforming forecast is it enough to bring it into um surplus or does it still mean it's operating in a deficit yeah let's get that offline it was more of a statement than the question actually okay yeah um aaron's that down to what's it sorry you're a mystery why why is that little revenue on parking down my understanding is simply volume related on and off street parking revenue is lower than budgeted I'd have to get the business to answer any more detail than that that's correct we've had um lower than expected uh revenue because fewer people have been parking so fewer parking we have fewer car parks yes we've had lower than expected so it's occupancy so this is driven by occupancy of the car parks that we've got that were the basis of the forecast not because there are less car parks available for use yes it's a combination of the car parks and on the street but overall it's below what we were forecasting yep that's clear right so would that be suggesting we're charging too much to park and that's why people are not using them so we look into that at some point okay so it'll change when young people start driving I know so I don to what's driving that particular outcome it's something that might be relevant to considerations I mean car park charges form part of the um ltp um so maybe it might be worth anticipating that this would come up as part of an uh ltp conversation yeah because mr chair something I've raised each time we've removed on street car parking is that it doesn't um it doesn't trigger a financial implication which is a little bit alarming that you'd take away an asset that returns you several thousand dollars a year but it doesn't that doesn't count as a financial implication where I believe it should okay so that could be it but it might not be so it'll be good to know because mike might be right maybe the buses are full and uh so we seem to have moved well beyond questions at this point but I think you know the points made um and yeah it will be interesting to know what it is that's driving that um I mean what you're talking about is the number of car parks available what we're talking about here is the uptake and the revenue from those car parks which are available been lower than expected because of less use than expected um two different matters but both of which are capable have been um picked up as part of the ltp okay um any other questions jimmy maybe this is a silly question but I still like to ask a star if we review those two pie charts I'm just concerned for instance like it looks like if we contribute more capital expenditure then we probably will be reduced big number big amount of the operation expenditure for instance like three waters waste water water supply storm water capital one we contribute 12 to 7. three percent and then we spend a lot for upgrading costs however the routine and the full path we contribute for 23 percentage then those operating expenditures only spend for 16 percentage and also the transportation no capital expenditure eight percent dg then operation a potential is a three percentage so I just don't know what's the relation I think the pie charts are just trying to give you an idea of where the spend is occurring for optics and capex and to some extent um they don't change a lot it takes a lot to change them in terms of you know a lot of money needs to either be not spent or additional spend to actually change that pie chart much um and I think to some degree they just are what they are and they reflect they reflect you know the the budget decisions you've made and then the spend decisions um so jimmy this is simply reporting back situation because I'm concerned that for instance routing and the full pass you know actually you know it's a those percentage is relative is low whether it's a still can regular quality of maintenance those so I think what you're talking about is a discussion that's more relevant for the ltp than this report back that we've got today the balance between capital expenditure and the need for maintenance and where we choose to spend our capital area rather than for this report today this is simply reporting back on budgets that we've previously put in place um if we felt that those budgets should be put in place differently then that would be a matter for the long-term plan okay thank you thank you anything else all right now I'm happy to move receipt of this information do I have a second before that james gough all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you so now moving on to item 11 the asset performance and condition report so peers welcome to the table now we've got two reports items 11 and 12._``_4466.239 we'll take both of them as read we'll deal with them one at a time obviously um but um yeah certainly happy to receive any commentary that you have on item 11 and then we'll move to questions great thank you good morning councillors um I've got a couple of slides here I'm just going to step you through I appreciate that the condition and performance report that you've received is a was about 60 pages of detail so I'll try and nip through what we've got on here at the moment previously you've received four independent reports and the for for this particular committee there was a question asked can we bring this together into a single report now um this these reports gave you some um indication of what the value and condition of our assets were and obviously you've had a number of reports prior with shifts in the three waters evaluations and a lot of this work has been focused on helping to understand where the gaps are in the information for areas such as valuation importantly enough we're now moving into performance-based information as well and that's a big maturity step for councils as a whole and particularly this council as we start looking at that I've displayed a number of projects to you over the previous years that are beginning to drive that that question of how are our assets performing so I think importantly about 63 of those metrics that you've looked at in that report have's giving us better uh confidence in the planning capability that we have for processes like a long-term plan what information do we have and how does that underpin where we invest of particular interest for me has been transport area and making sure that the assets related in that report are coming up and we've had nzta technical and procedural report that's come through and they're very pleased with the shift in information that we hold about our roading and path assets in that space parks once again has been a really significant push from the teams to get into much more levels of detail around information about their particular asset base there were some gaps previous reports around some health and safety aspects things like safety rails and the teams really double down in that area to make sure that information is in place I guess it's not all roses I think the challenges that we have found in doing this particular report which has taken a couple of my team many months to actually pull this together we still have challenges around information treatment plants um of and that's becoming a particular focus for the teams given the valuation space that we had in three waters area we had a 3.87 billion dollar jump in our asset valuation last time around a lot of reasons for that one of which not the majority factor of it was asset related information so we know there's some gaps there this report and bringing this report to this committee helps the team to keep focused on understanding where those gaps are sitting we've got a as I've alluded to we've had a number of projects that have been driving planning type capability for the ltp you'll hear me use this four letter acronym the double aif project the planning tool that we use for reticulation I did a presentation to that a number of months ago it's those sort of projects that help us understand where the gaps are in the data and that's that's been really important in understanding how that data is used to deliver and de-risk investment scenarios that the staff put together for this helps us understand where those gaps are and we're now beginning to understand where performance is so if you have if you remember back there's an a3 sheet that sat in front of that report with a number of um areas that we're focused on in particular you can see that there are gaps within performance and that's really you know a lot not a lot of councils are in that headspace about how are our assets performing and it goes back to that simple analogy we might replace a roof on a building we might replace a pipe and we will give that a condition of one it's brand new it's shiny but actually if the roof leaks is it giving us the level of performance that our communities expect from it and so it's that performance and how the data is being used to derive that that information that really helps us understand are we actually looking after the assets in the best way so we're on that journey 19 to 21 we've been developing these reports the it was a huge amount of effort for the team to to bring these reports to you um and we're now in the process of of um automating it should get to a point where it's almost push a button and here's the report so we've got a we've still got a journey to go in that and that this little slide here helps us understand where we're actually going and ultimately we're now beginning to focus on the ltp for 2024. what are the improvements and where where are the gaps to make sure we do risk the investment okay on to the sixth monthly report um unless there are any questions sorry uh council attorney do you want to go to questions on on this or yeah let's deal with them one item at a time so we'll deal with item 11 first and then we'll come to item 12 separately um so this has obviously taken some time to get to this point but it's good that we're now here and clearly significant progress has there was a an asymmetry of activity particularly between transport and waters you've called out a number of issues with some of the water assets am I right in thinking that the three waters area is one area where you'll be putting specific information with the intention of bringing that asset data up to the same level that we've got the the transport asset data correct that that is exactly what we're doing so as as we start understanding where the gaps are and what the implications of those gaps we have to make a decision do we spend time effort and resource on fixing our laterals data that we've got no because that doesn't figure hugely in the investment and it's actually a relatively small component of the overall asset base however our wastewater treatment plant and the the understanding of our asset base within that that's a critical asset that we need to spend more time on and us understanding how that breakdown occurs allows my team to focus in that area and when do you think we would get of um data on water assets as we currently do on transport assets well a lot of the three waters reform is driving the um the imperative to understand how that data is being used and answered your question timeline I would expect over the next six to eight months the pump station environment we should understand the detail behind that gap and that that then becomes a a process of filling filling in the mortar between the brickwork I guess is probably a metaphor to use um for our wastewater treatment plant I'm at the very early stages of trying to understand um the unknown unknowns in that space and um diana diane branch and I've had a couple of conversations around the the next potential valuation that we need to do so you know that it's that valuation work that helps drive what is the information that we hold about our assets yeah and then final question from me um you're proposing to bring this report to us next in april next year um I'm assuming that means that you're intending bringing onwards as far as the program or the condition and performance report the performance and condition report we've got item two sorry item three approved the timing for the next asset condition and performance report to be um submitted to finance performance in april 2023 so that's a year away obviously this has been coming six monthly given the concerns around needing to bring the water data up to the same level as transport data and the concern around filling gaps and given the comment that you made around with the work that's been done this should very soon be as simple as just pushing a button to get the report why would you be proposing to bring this annually rather than six monthly I realized you know the alignment with ltp preparation is is one part of the answer but if it's easy to bring it six monthly and there's work going on that will be reporting six monthly why would you be proposing to bring it annually I think it's just the number of reports that you have to receive as the in into the correct cycle so the the process of bringing a report to you um and the effort that has been required that's one element of it but it's also ensuring that the shift in uh or the change in that data set is that actually materially relevant if we if if these numbers change within you know one percent of each other there's not a lot of point of bringing the report at this level of regularity okay now my mental arithmetic has let me down 2023 is two years away not one year away um you wouldn't consider bringing something to us at least in a year's time as an interim update if you if you would prefer to receive it yearly then you know that's something that we can do happy to do that um what we could do to to lessen the the paper burden is to do it more of an exception report to say we will bring you the changes that have occurred all the significant changes of which I would suggest that pump stations and the to understand a little bit more detail we may have that detail by that point okay so that would then see us bringing a um an exceptions report in april 22 and the next version we see this full report would be in april 23 as part of that early stage of ltp 2024 development yeah because I think fundamentally having this report prior to an ltp process helps council understand do we have the right information underpinning the investment scenarios and therefore the question that if I was a counselor that I would be asking me would typically be do we have the capability to use that information to understand where we where we invest and that's the space that the team are trying to operate so I think all of that speaks to that interim exceptions report been brought in a year's time in april 22 and then the full report in april 23. so if we can change the resolution to reflect that um assuming that people are generally in agreement then that would be the way to go all right and pierce from your we're not putting a huge burden on the team just given the comments you made around you know reporting becomes easier the further into this we go yes I'm happy with doing that um the challenge being is to develop the system capability to get to that point and that's the priority for the for one part of my team at the moment to deliver that press right yeah I mean given that we're talking a year away you'd anticipate there would have been some progress in that space in the meantime yeah all right great thank you all right so is there anything else on item 11 before we move to item 12. um sam and then yani yeah thanks um so I'm just trying to understand at a really basic level so using that roof analogy you had does that mean things like as we when we get this report back again and you've done more work on it we will get to the point where we're preventing things like the akara sort of issue when you're looking at that level where you will genuinely know if there is an issue I'm just trying to see that because I get what you're saying about the valuation uplift but as you said the driver behind that was actually a lot of it was unit rate changes in that which pushed it up correct um but where does this tangibly lead to that fits the um so in all aspects of our business particularly at this level um you're about trying to manage that risk element so the more information that we have to an appropriate level because there's a there's a cost trade-off to the amount of money that we invest in that that helps us de-risk the business would it have directly helped acro I can't really talk to that at the moment I think that there are is a very complex area even just at a practical level though those kind of assets is what I'm trying get to so there'll be a so we'll get to the point where you've done this work and there'll be outcome is uh we can identify these issues a lot more proactively than we can you can only manage what you know about yeah yeah yeah without sort of getting into it I guess the frustration is that we've I mean even in my time here we've kept talking about this I'm just trying to see when we get to an end date on on where a lot more that information is available well I mean as you can tell from the report itself there's been that there's been significant improvement across the realm so to speak um is it ever going to am I ever just going to be able to hang my coat up and say we're done no it is a constant process of keeping the teams focused on um working on the business to improve the way that they're working in the business aspect so I'm not sure whether that really that's okay yep that's fine thanks thank you yani yeah I mean it's it's a similar line if I if I go to told in terms of um the pump stations um water supply pumping condition grade and it's on page 129 right um 3.22 how complete reliable is the condition data uncertain and then we've got 28 of water supply station assets not having a start-up date the backlog and an understated valuation data we have assessed the water supply data is uncertain I i can't understand and we'll also tell there's a backlog of renewal data with all the focus we've had on water supply to try and get the chlorine out of the water like how can we not have good information like didn't we just go through this whole issue with the contractor and have this huge problem because of it and yet nearly I know two three years on we've still got uncertainty how are we managing that from a risk point of view because it would seem to me that would be one of the top priorities and yet it doesn't appear to have been so um the way that the report and the maturity of the way quite a pessimistic view that if the information that we hold about an asset lives on a uncontrolled spreadsheet on somebody's hard drive that doesn't have sufficient breadth of visibility across that information we don't consider it to be as trustworthy as having information in sap or gis systems so we take a pretty hard line to say that when we're making critical investment decisions that having information that's derived from an uncontrolled spreadsheet that sits on bob's desk I don't consider that to be for the purposes of this report to be appropriate to bring to this table the usage of some information to derive investment the teams work with the information that they have and they make the best decisions that they can as far as why haven't we fixed some of these problems it's these reports that help us understand where the problems are okay so what what what resolution do you need from us to get the water supply network condition data to a point where we can have certainty in it well I guess this is resolution that says that you need to to see um a better understanding of that the information around specific assets I don't think there's a lot of value in saying just bring all the asset related information up to a perfect level unless you happen to have some funding that I'm unaware of the the focal area around these as I said it's wastewater treatment plant and it's pump stations the teams are really focused in that area now that they understand the implications of how that information is being used or not used all right so when will we get the backlog sorted so the framework was agreed to last week as to how that backlog will be filled it's not just a case of put a list in and upload it to the system they have to agree to the framework of how that information is going to be used otherwise that will drive a lot of cost so I guess it's like the point sam's making though is like this is really valuable information but you know we're long-term plan and having a resident survey so I guess what I'm interested in is like how does this information guide what we invest in as a priority based on the presentation that we had from I mean sorry I can't remember the woman's name which was an excellent presentation that said if you've got things deteriorating you know you need to fix them rather than keep building new things which is what we think you know just last week we approved a few new new nice new road improvements and yet we've got things that are chronically failing that are not being addressed because we don't have the information it goes back to a question that I had at a previous committee meeting your involvement and interest in the information that underlies how these processes run is part of that that value proposition the teams are really focused on driving that information uplift there's we can always do with more resource and investment in that area it comes back down to prioritization within the organization as to where the sets do we or a footpath or do we invest in the information about that road and footpath and there's a there's a constant balancing act between effectively back office investment and front of office pathways pools libraries etc that the communities want to see and that I guess is the balancing act that you have when you're trying to look at investment in you know i.t enablement and digital citizen that that is another perennial challenge of how far do we invest in that compared with building a structure or investing in renewal so I can't it's not an easy question for me to answer and give me a dollar and I can deliver you a very specific outcome we know where the priorities are and that's what this report is here to highlight for you so do we have any sorry final question do we have any sense of when the water supply pump stations um that data will we we can have certainty in it I would expect by the end of the um the calendar year that that data set should be at teams have just I believe have finalized the structure of how that information is going to be entered and nothing we can do to speed it up I don't think at this point because the maintenance contract for the water supply and that for the three waters environments being is driving a lot of that as a matter of course and all of that speaks to getting that reported back to us in a year's time once that work has completely has been completed by year end having it reported to us in that interim exception report that we referred to before that all makes sense any further questions and yeah thanks peter um just uh 1.1.3 uh on page um performance there is no performance data currently analyzed for parks and I'm just wondering just wanting to understand that a bit more and also 1.1.5 confirm an appropriate methodology to assess asset performance so can you tell us a bit more about that so the the component about parts I mean it's the same for a lot of the assets that we don't derive cycle so um bus stations they're they're replaced quote me on this but every 18 months of bus stations just replace there's no point doing condition or performance related information because it drives a huge amount of cost we just know that you know on average these assets last this length of time um it would be the same for a park bench we we replace park benches at a level of regularity in that space so that's you know there's an annualized replacement program that the teams manage all right thank you so jimmy yes the just take example uh page 118 here you mentioned the uh value the million dollars this one this date present value or is uh what kind of value uh for sorry I i can't recall exactly page 118 the value of which assets this this one is like where's the water pipe you know you have value this value is after the depreciation value uh well it depends yes it is so if that's the depreciated number that you're referring to in there then you know you're presented to the council particular emphasizer systemize and the automation one I'm not sure if that's true whether those depreciation or technology innovation you are also part of this report or not particularly for the civil security the those the asics so are you asking is the systemized approach that we're taking taking into account depreciation yes yes uh yes it just depends on how we cut the numbers yeah yeah I know but but after several years you can see this uh the innovations continue you know continue go so maybe the existing asic cannot meet the future needs it's not not not effectively or efficiently in that kind of factor you also consider um is it a factor that I consider in the creation of the report to to use depreciation and also the technology you know innovation I mean the technology can do whatever we need it to do it's really around how we want to display those numbers whether they are depreciated or optimized appreciated or otherwise in that um in that space so I'm I maybe offline we might yeah all all right so we've got some um recommendations in front of us here we've just changed the wording in um the paragraph three um and if we can just firm that up a little bit actually with an exceptions report to be submitted to the committee just makes it very very clear what we're expecting with an exceptions report to be said yep that's fine all right so I'm happy to be the mover of that do I have a second sarah um all those in favor say aye against as carried and then moving straight on to item 12 for the asset management improvement program six monthly report and I'm guessing piers that takes us back to your presentation it does so I've tried to sell the just sell it down so we have been closing out a number of um pieces of work the first one of which is the is the asset management plan as part of the overall ltp program very challenging piece of work um the templates and the bringing together all and obviously there's a lot of the information that's used in that these amps and the process used not only is the quality improved in my in my opinion and in some of the external audits that we've had of them but it's helped us understand where some of the challenges are within the business we have lots of documents now but it's us understanding how we're going to improve on the capability that sits behind that pile of paper so more importantly for me this has been bringing the teams together in a much more um strategic viewpoint for things like resilience um and climate change and really getting the teams to understand what does that actually mean in a context of an asset management plan for 3.5.2 there are strategic asset management plans so if you can think about this as the the asset strategy that links into all the other pieces of work whether it's within the waters team you know the integrated three water strategy the infrastructure strategy the financial strategy we've got lots of strategies and this now we've got asset plans that for the first time in our history have been published externally I'm not sure that there are a lot of constituents out there that sit there perusing over the hundreds and hundreds of pages but the asset management plans themselves being published has actually shifted the way that the teams view that document it becomes more of a living document because somebody might have eyes on it and may ask a question of them as to how the assets are being managed as part of a as part of our local government act that we're looking after our assets so this these two these two pieces of work done in conjunction with one another we've used the teams to help us understand strategically how the assets should be managed and where some of the pressure points are and how do we link that into the rest of the process that's ongoing moving on to the next impact project that's really completed you had a asset maturity report that came out you've seen you've seen that that itself and you can see that where the teams have invested in there you get the biggest returns and that's obviously around the asset systems and the information that we use that's that's the that's the area of focus for my team and also for a lot of the other teams um the other project that was that we've completed out recently I tried to put a diagram together so we had a white paper that came to the committee which was trying to look at what the future state of asset management and council looks like and what are some of those priorities and we you know the focus is building trust and that information that comes through there's no point me putting a report up if you can't trust the information that sits behind it we're about creating asset management insights so that's some of the planning tools that double aif for instance that are reported through we try and bridge the technology and the business in their asset management function and that's obviously to improve the capability don't want to have 15 sources of truth where everybody's arguing that that's the truth we want to provide information and go that is the authoritative space we want effective governance and oversight so it's part of this presentation today and more importantly we're trying to take a whole of asset life approach we build a structure we do a capital investment and then the cost of managing that structure over its 100 150 200 year lifecycle that's where the real opportunities come in because that's predominantly an opex related cost so we're trying to look at how do we understand the information that sits behind it and then obviously around organization-wide asset management leadership I try and put that exciting subject onto the table of everybody I can and sometimes that's challenging but having these reports coming to you and your engagement forms part of that that system and then obviously underneath it we're there to develop competent motivated staff in this area so that project completed and that's really providing a framework for how we move forward those assets for communities well I guess whilst there's a lot of detail that sits in the program I guess the takeaway from this is that we are progressing projects we are moving through the system the quantitative measurement that we provide you through our maturity assessment report that hopefully gives you trust that through external audits progress is being made and that there is a program and a systemized approach that we're taking to improving the asset capability and the oversight that we provide into it so for each one of those areas we're looking and supporting the teams across those outcomes I think that's pretty much about it as far as the program I'm happy to take any questions on the program in and of itself all right thank you very much other questions on this report all right so we're just moving to receive this which I'm happy to do um jimmy chen seconds any debate although he's in favor say aye against as carried pierce thanks very much indeed for presenting these to us today um and to these reports together thanks very much indeed thank you okay all right so that now brings us to item 13 capital delivery major facilities elected member updates um aleister welcome to the table and welcome back to the table um we'll take the report as red but um are there any highlights that you want to draw our attention to um not one particular one with the rmc because the pictures are quite old so the old municipal chambers the pictures are quite old and for those that have seen notice there's a huge scaffold going around the facility at the moment and that is to uh and enclose the building in a plastic wrap which means we can start stripping the building internally and externally so it's a really positive move forward for the team and and great to see that work being done so that's probably the only real update on across the elected member updates as a whole really yeah great and um yeah whilst there isn't um perhaps a lot worthy of particular note in here it is good to get a number of these um across a number of these projects um and yeah in particular as you say old municipal chambers um some you know very obvious work going on there which is great to see yeah thank you moving to questions no questions yeah cathedral square are we gonna get some sort of report because obviously you've made reference to mb um in the hotel having the exercise area and it um you're saying that thinking about relocating it and I know that we've also got um and I've only seen what's in the media there's big plans for the old post office building but is there any kind of report that's going to come around what's actually being done bringing all the kind of cathedral square stuff together yeah so we're doing a it's a it's a light master plan if you will for the whole of the activities right across each section of the square and one in particular we've we've been doing dealing with the mb and miq facility for distinction which we're negotiating with them at the moment which is to take up some private land that's being utilized this can be utilized elsewhere and off the actual square itself which is a good way forward and which will allow us to commence that work in that south east corner and we're working with um the chamberlain team and the uh on the old post office building as well with regards to that piece of work which is the south west corner that's yep southwest corner uh and that's uh that's a piece of work that we're negotiating with them as well and it all becomes part and parcel of the master plan so it's about tidying the area in the in the north west corner as well which is adjacent the um to pi convention center so we're doing work in that area as well so we're just planning and pulling everything together at the moment in one view right which incorporates the obviously the memorial removal the demolition of the poster of the uh old police kiosk all we're pulling that together while we've had the downtime in between not being able to do the south east we're pulling that together at the moment so that's a piece of work that's underway and we will be bringing that back for review so when are we likely to see um because I think the major said good news story so I mean it is good to see you know more progress and things getting done in the square I mean it being tidied up so when are we likely to kind of see what the big picture is for the square he's just said that yeah yeah just what we're doing is uh again is there a date that you know so the project steering groups this friday and so I'll be at that that steering group where I expect to hear from the project manager the full view on the next steps for us which will inform the next elected member member update which will be two months from now um but we'll be bringing a master plan back because that's the intent at the moment to try and wrap it all up in one piece yes yep and that was uh chris who is the project manager decided that that was the best way forward with that yep all right thank you very much aaron yeah just something that was raised last week alastair at the disability who he was a week before now was changing spaces and with us as a city having a number of major facilities were developing or redeveloping when are we likely to see them go and we were kind of given a heads up on it a couple years ago so one of the first cities invited into the program and it looks like we'll be one of the last to be in the program yet we're doing the most building across the whole portfolio yeah yeah because to host to be a destination city for the access dollar you we need these spaces and various you'd expect it anywhere that might host anything which is pretty much everything on this list so hornby is included we we are looking at it for the square at the moment we are so also so rachel who is amazing when you get her in the room without his own teams rachel is also engaged with the cmua design team now that they literally came on board and she was in the room the next day which is fantastic right so she's certainly being heard and they are including uh to meet those needs and wants for the for the disability community and accessibility communities yeah because the convention center um turned turned down the opportunity it was late in the piece but um and the um the metro sports facility is that is that having a changing spaces or something better I heard it's good I need to ask that question I'm not as heavily if we could get um if you're able to send through some design detail or something to present to that um the disability working group at the next meeting would be real handy just over on this thank you all right thank you jake um uh the in terms of moving you're looking at um leasing that landlord it's not us it's um sergio who is the owner of the spark building and the building across the road also owns the sites at the back of there as well at the rear of that so he's there we've got a plan that john maker from our strategy so what is his offer you guys are looking perfect cool thank you thank you for the oh thank you um following on actually from aaron there's a youth um audit tool that I'm not sure if you're aware of um when uh is there a youth voice involved in in in this work yeah so which particular piece okay well well I can talk definitely talk to the cmua right because I know in the early days of the engagement process we went through we did go and meet the youth group and we presented and we've we've taken feedback from them on the initial designs and I'll be honest that the minute the amount of workshops that the current teams are swap pack team have hit the ground uh not running sprinting I'd say and there's a lot of um my team and and the team that's on board being on board in the period have been engaged in probably three times a day at the moment in workshops so it's uh they're they're they know what they've got to meet and they know the objectives and all of those entities have been listed as stakeholders to be engaged with at the minute we're in rats in concept ratification which is more around the structure and the eventual outcomes we're trying to achieve so yes they are on the list and there will be there will have an opinion and a voice in the process yeah great thank you okay so um we have got this um set of resolutions in front of us so just receiving the information in the update I'm happy to move that do I have a seconder pauline any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you now I had indicated it's now three minutes to um I do want to um give time to do the multi-use arena report um justice so aleister that means that we'll need to bring you back to do that one so we'll look forward to doing that after we've considered items 14 15 and 20. um so we'll come back and do that one separately so thank you very much indeed um and I'll now adjourn the meeting until 11 15 can I please request that we are back at 11 15 ready to start because we do have animals here um who are expecting to be able to present at um 11 15 so we'll break um now until 11 15 but we'll be starting back bang on quarter past thank you do you guys want to come up to the table welcome joe and therese and thanks very much for making the time I know you've got uh another appointment as well so it's great you can come through I think we can largely take it as red but do you want then we'll open up for questions if anyone has any uh I'm kind of keen to keep the meeting moving if we can good morning um I just wanted to run you through uh just a few points part half part of the report is the half-year report to 31 december and I would just note on that that cnz has been successful in achieving further central government funding than expected I also want to refer back to the workshop which was I think last week um and note to you that we we have taken into account uh or we will in the feedback provided about this funding needing to be updated both the third party and the ltp funding there were just some anomalies that need to be updated there's a few performance measures that need to have benchmark targets put in which cnz is working towards achieving they're currently working on the urban development work pipeline which won't be completed in time for 30 june but will be well progressed and the only other comment we would raise is whether the soi of funding allocation to the particular activity groups in the soi uh acknowledging that though that's an indication of the allocation and may change but that gets picked up and reporting and becomes very transparent and that's all I wanted to say great thank you very much joe or therese is there anything you want to run through yeah just just very briefly thank you chair um I just want to thank you all for the input that you gave us during the workshop session last week as linda said um that feedback will be incorporated into the next version of the draft it was very useful feedback and in particular in relation to multicultural committees so thank you for that um the performance measures that are the two documents in front of you the q2 report as linda said we're well on target and we're very pleased to be able to present this to you today and then the statement of intent obviously looks at our activity over the next three years and is aligned with the level of funding that has been outlined in answer any specific questions there is there anything you wanted to add or I would echo what joanna has said um it's been a great first half and we're really looking forward to getting our soi locked away and continue to deliver that for christchurch right thank you very much are there any questions no oh yummy um I paused for too long yeah I i note that you've got a partnership with the crusaders um and noting that we've got like a home final coming up have you got anything planned I mean do you have like I just remember back in the river shield games the city you know used to get really excited about a final or you know a key game and there used to be a lot of central city promotion so I just wanted do you kind of have capacity to do that one-off sort of special events promotion um yes we do and I don't want to be presumptuous about the performance of the team because we have no control over that but what we do control is the partnerships are directly designed to reach the largest possible audience which we largely do through the broadcast audience um if we are in a position to be celebrate celebrating holding the cup and then we may look at tactical activations to reach our own residents as well but in terms of the game day or the or people coming to the city do we do anything to say I wonder just in terms of what we're trying to achieve here it's probably a really detailed question that maybe you could take offline with joe and the team I'm just conscious we have got I mean it's it's a really operational thing just uh okay so the other the other question was just around the um the buskers festival um the bread and circus are we gonna get a detailed sort of report around the expenditure and the attendance and kind of an evaluation of how it's gone now we report through to this committee on our on the performance that is captured within our levels of service and our statement of intent that a special session in relation to buskers at your request it's not part of our normal reporting great okay thank you anything else jimmy uh let's review the uh the 4.5 that's the bully point I'm not sure in here why mention the miscommitment reduce the organization specific carbon emission by 2045 I remember based on council lost later about the the expectation it's four consumed by 2030. a carbon emission neutrality in the black is rather than 2045 and this is the target that we've been given in the letter of expectation and if you want to revise that you'll need to let us know with a revised letter of expectation we did discuss that at the workshop that we had and we um noted that you would like us to have that 2030 target uh in the loe for next year for christchurch new zealand yeah thanks that's what we have been through okay so thank you uh who would like to move this sierra would like to move it who would like to see him but jimmy would like think it would be good to get a formal report back on the buskers festival um when we agreed to the new format we did put in quite a considerable investment um and I think it would be good just to kind of understand how that's going now obviously code 19's had a massive impact but it just seems to me that um for the level of expenditure that we put into something with an expectation of getting a certain outcome it would be really good to see how that how that's going so I don't know how others feel about that but that would certainly be um we do have some very limited information in the six monthly report but it's certainly not not detailed um enough cool is anyone else no oh no just in debate so the only other thing I'd say is I mean that workshop last week was really really all the week four was really really useful and I know you're on the same page when you talk about tangible measurable outcomes and we certainly look forward the time to come in we really appreciate you both here as chief exec and angio thank you bye thank you all thank you everyone great thank you now we'll hand back to andrew and the base do you want to come up to the table thank you so I'd now invite the representatives from venues otautahi to the table um and we've got item 20 the direct statement of intent and the half-year performance report um so linda if you've got some introductory remarks and then um if the team from venues or tatahi would like to make any comments that will be helpful and then we'll move to questions thank you so we have both a half year report to 31 december and the draft soi a half year performance better than expected fewer events but more catering uh big issue is with fewer events uh the loss of the social benefit that's not monetized so it's less it's not so easy to see the draft sy we are working with um venus ultitahi to update the capital expenditure requirements the current draft the orange theory stadium funding is shown separately uh and will be reported against separately uh in the quarterly reports the assumptions on the financials are that the borders international board is open in the 22-23 year but as caroline has said before um this huge amount of volatility due to the uncertainty uh in that of events and what how the how the covert restrictions might track in future I just wanted to remind you that um venusaur he faces high fixed costs that are uncontrollable relating to the town hall and the christchurch arena and finally that there are no similar operating costs or revenues reflected in the soi that information is not known at this stage and that's my rundown all right thank you um is there any commentary from the team from venues or tatahi this is the second time we've seen you this week of course we had the benefits of the workshop earlier in the week which allowed this item to come onto the agenda so thank you all right all good thank you and look um probably similarly tuesday it's been really helpful to continue to have that discussion together and we obviously have some revisions and to make to our draft psi as a result um we also uh probably have note by way of the half year performance report um albeit we were impacted uh by covert and that and the impacts of that you can see some of the changes that we have made to the business particularly by way of reduced operating costs and the the change to local procurement that that is genuinely having an impact uh commercially for the for the organization so that that is a real positive noting that obviously the social and cultural impacts of events in the city has has not been as great given the reduced number of events and just of note with regard to cmua the the discussion we had kind of in the last couple of days by way of any assumptions that could be made in ltps etc could be baseline what's in the investment case um but as a placeholder because obviously we at the moment are working through quite design at the moment and just establishing how those things will actually translate into the operating model for the cmua but thank you um so looking at the half-year performance report the fact that in the current environment um 41 events cancelled um you've managed to exceed budget I think is significant achievement and well done and also noting some of the changes that you've made to the operating model bringing the catering in-house and obviously a strong focus on food and beverage performance and flexibility around staffing levels I'm guessing that they're all things that have played into that space of um being able to exceed budget in that very constrained and uncertain environment yeah so we've really uh and we're forced really into at the end of june last year and we downsized both around 60 and really changed from quite a fixed uh resourcing model to quite a variable resourcing model so we have a core skeleton staff and we can flex as we need to with a more casual workforce and that will remain albeit as we get more into to probably uh increase that fixed model just slightly but it certainly won't return to such a fixed model that we had prior to covert okay thank you and then looking forward into the draft statement of intent referring to paragraph 3.12 in our report you'll have completed the development of the economic model and prioritization methodology to further inform draft sli forecasts by the time the final soi is due are you expecting that to deliver major changes to the statement of intent and at the same time noting obviously this is non-financial rather than financial are you expecting that to drive a major change we don't expect it to drive major change no um I've been engaging with um venus otahi on these two models which I am due to go and um have a session with them to be updated they already have been taken into account to a large extent in the current draft soi forecasts so that they are built on that prioritization model okay that's great thank you any further questions on the um six monthly before half year similar to the question asked at the workshop but what what I struggle to see some from the performance report is um which of the venues are performing and which ones aren't so what I'm really interested to understand is like the temporary stadium you know how is that performing given that we're underwriting it um they had the oval which I know vbas have had a relationship with so do we have any kind of sense of what's happening across the venues in terms of ones that are at least paying for themselves not not generating profit but not making massive losses yes we um obviously um own and operate uh the town hall and the arena and work in with um with other um as the operator and manager of the likes of hagley over operator and working with other owners there um it is and we've just taken on and transitioned just in the last month for working with council on the on the orange theory stadium uh we will need to build on that information but we actually do have the within the statement of intent but we do have that information I'm on each of the venues and um and so we can draw that out and provide some further development yeah we can't we can certainly split it out I think that the the couple of challenges and one is sort of will be resolved somewhat with the transition of the stadium to and the under right from council for orange theory is that you know now that is a break even because of that uh the hagley oval for instance we have um at times we need to have a look at some of the commercial arrangements that have been put in place over the years and we run it a bit of a loss particularly because rnm associated with pavilion and then town hall and arena we can split out those numbers but they're a bit more in our control yeah just to jump in I think some of this I mean there's clearly some commercial sensitivities around some of the broader subject matter we're talking about here um may well be right time rather than in this particular forum today given that to have the discussions that yanI's um wanting to have fully um it will inevitably require some discussion around commercially sensitive information we're going to get a separate memo back aren't we on the transition of the state orange theory stadium is that yeah we didn't discuss that on tuesday it'll be a joint um a report back from the council and venue's order right do we have a date for the transition to be complete though that's still we're still waiting to hear from dpmc and the trust on that okay all right um just the other thing that I just um in terms of I see in the statement of intent but just in terms of the community access um what the community rate yeah I guess I was just interested to kind of understand how many community groups were using your venues if you've got like a figure and um yeah I guess just to get some sense of who's actually using the community right back events and the financials on there um but we can certainly break that down little bit further um as to who those groups are and and that has shown quarterly as well in regard to our performance measures so both quarterly and then within the fear reports that's right we'll be reporting very shortly on the um on the results through to march um and even with moving into alert levels and the like we are certainly on track in regard to that performance measure any further questions yes further just another further question on the local cultural rate I see any opportunity to develop some sort of sponsorship model where businesses are actually able to pay for the money for groups to use venues is there something that you've thought about um similarly in a way is how we're trying to structure the utahi collective and that more syndicate approach to naming rights and so every one of those bespoke partnerships will have a community fund one of the other opportunities in the partnership is to be able to sponsor certain events and we could thing about how we're hopefully going to be able to design these bespoke partnerships is that businesses who partner with us will actually be able to align their strategic drivers with how they design their partnership and so if that is something that's important to their business then that's something we could build in yeah see that you could actually build really strong connections and relationships between businesses and community groups and and support them financially to get to use the venues you can see that happening yeah um I think there's uh there are a few um businesses around that really want to do more in their corporate and social responsibility and community engagement and if we can support that and bring that connection to the fore then that would be a wonderful thing to be able to do yeah thank you that's really encouraging because it is about equity and equity of accessibility to our venues so thanks for that thank you so I'm happy to move the recommendation that's in front of us do I have a second for that both together in this so if you're not done with questions we'll come back to questions yes cost the principal as 14.8 million 14.8 million still to go on that okay okay so this has been moved and seconded is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you very much thank you so now we'll move to the equivalent reporting from cchl so sam if I can get you to um jump back into the chair cool okay do you want to run through just at a really high level what you can acknowledging that there's cchl can't_''_9423.04 be here to answer their stuff in this forum and then what we'll do is no obviously note the council of directors are stepping back and then we'll go straight to questions and then I know yanI's got some amendments which I think this team have come up with um and then we'll see if anyone else got your changes and then move through it so do you want to run us through really briefly me already come before you with the quarterly report the key aspects I just want to run through are that the financials in the draft statements are draft financials they're still in their business planning period and they will be finalized in the in time for the final soi the cchl report that accompanies the draft sois has drawn out a number of omissions that they intend going back to their subs to rectify a number of them are errors but they will all be picked up and we'll reinforce them and the feedback we give to make sure that we've got a record to compare when we get the final sois um broadly the financials based on the draft numbers are improved over expectations last year um that's all again drawn out in the cchl report most if not all of them have commitments to living wage commitments to diversity commitments to executive remuneration restraint commitments to group sustainability and carbon reduction noting that it's quite complex and they're they're approaching that at a group level and uh one other uh a airport's dividend expectations which they took out last year and haven't put back in but we'll be asking them to very good thank you for that lena is there anything you have to add no I mean just apologize from the cchl team um that nobody's here to answer direct questions and we'll take note of any questions which we can give to paul and the team if they arise yeah sure thank you okay so we'll go through questions mike do you want to start thank you um it's actually really disappointing um that we don't have cchl staff here we've just had um christchurch nz and venus alta tahi present with both their ce and chair so I've got a couple of questions and I'm going to quickly questions would be good right yeah but I'm just saying it's actually going to affect my decision I make because I can't make a decision unless I get it okay so to dawn with regards to the statement of 10 for dcl do you believe this excluded meeting on the 28th of may 2020 do you believe that the content within the dcl statement of intent actually reflects the directive that council gave um cchl at the public exclusive meeting on the 28th of may 2020. if you give me a few minutes I will reflect on that and try and answer that question thank you another question uh another letter of expectation to cchl we we ask in there that all members of its wider group target carbon neutrality by 2030. in the statement of intent they've actually said that it's going to be a group target and I just want to know the reasoning behind this and actually are we letting companies transition not as quickly as council has requested I think on that particular issue it would be um far more informative for a cchl member to discuss that I think the the um key issue there is that at a group level bringing targeting it at a group level allows them to manage the different impacts that some um are facing more so than others and it gets them it whole there and then to move to addressing those companies that have quite a lot more exposure to or create much more carbon look and thanks I don't expect you to actually answer the question I'd expect someone from cchl to answer this question but to me I think they've just let in some of the companies off the hook for doing some work that's actually needed can we just go to questions for now there'll be definitely a time for debate mike I'll guarantee you that well I would love to ask questions if I had the appropriate people here to ask them okay well I can't fix that today but if you just calm down and weave up that's very so you're actually not participating so can we just stop for a sec if everyone just stops right so right what we're going to say so you turn your mic on yeah yeah so the feedback we had that was that we could add some information if it was useful but not participate in debate and voting right that we we have a and my understanding is that we have a briefing or workshop coming up with cchl on their climate work really soon so that might be really helpful yeah thanks sarah that's great any other questions yummy so um thanks um just wanted to check um in regards to the um statements of intent like we we keep seem to repeat the same information around senior executive remuneration and I see a number of them haven't even set targets so is there anything you think we should be asking cchl to in getting their companies to do differently that would get a better outcome um the loe um picked up uh the concern or the request for cchl to ask its subsidiaries to work on closing the gap between the highest and lowest paid cchl sent its own eloise to its subsidiaries before they received our loe and they have said that they will pick those issues up that came through and their feedback to the subsidiary so I would expect that to go through to the subsidiaries but so in the I'm table that shows there you go it's on page 173 so orion has got no comment on executive remuneration um and it's just got executive remuneration no specific targets no specific targets no specific targets no specific targets no comments no specific targets and in living wage it's got no comment from cial um and you know there's some companies that should be praised for actually addressing it but then there's um other ones that like acl no comment um and care limited it's a tvc so right I just don't know like like how do we get them to set targets oh right so are you looking at the box that uh is in the cchl report yeah so it's quite column 173 and it's the last two columns it's a really good I really appreciate whoever's put this report together that's such a good way of showing um things that we've asked for in the loa and how they're how they're being addressed um so you know it's really clear but it mickey out of us in regards to executive reneration where we keep asking the same thing but we keep getting a worse outcome and if you look at the I don't know if you've had a chance to see the information that was sent through but we're seeing you know huge bonuses still being paid and we don't seem to see very much of a reduction so anyway I mean the the short-term inventor incentive schemes that were operated by some of the subs you will note that um last year's annual reports um identified some were being phased out um and were basically being replaced by core remuneration and I think that was mentioned at a workshop um that ccho and jeremy and paul attended which basically showed you know that all these market considerations um we're scheme where they're competing for executive remuneration in the market they are pitching it at an appropriate level um that has not been benchmarked versus the public sector but um it actually has been benchmarked against the commercial operations and I think that's that in the private sector if you look at citicare the remuneration went up a hundred thousand dollars in one year you know that like that's insane a hundred thousand dollars in one year at a time when we know groups that we're struggling yeah I mean so I get this completely sentiment and I've got amendments to that effect cchl aren't here to answer these so I mean if there's a a way in which you could describe potentially how we could look at further targets but I'm not sure basically having got our staff over it is the most useful way of doing it right so basically yeah I've put up an amendment that we um you know that we include some feedback um because there should be able to be target set particularly around that relativity in terms of top to bottom and also that's really useful so if you've got any more questions and then we will get to your amendments as well yeah could I just perhaps um add that on yeah you can if you have is give everyone the chance to ask questions um so does anyone else the only other question I had does I thought jake did you not ever all right just the usual it's just a bit hard not having cchl here let's just think it's unfair on our staff for this so I'm sorry mr chamber but I just think this is that productive yeah yep melanie yep I'm just flagging I've seen through another amendment based off what mike was talking about okay I'll afford it yeah that's useful um does anyone else have any questions jimmy um on page 173 regarding to the ccha accessory company some of the comments you know based on these five categories no any comments I don't know what I mean and why what I mean it's a commitment for those kind of uh target or goals or is that you know I i don't know and also what is the cch here the attitude regarding the interesting comments exactly the same question yanny asks yep is there any other question yeah there anything in addition to what you already answered that you can provide to jimmy to give him some reassurance I could just um repeat that we are no no no anything in addition no okay yep no cool right james okay thanks dumpsters new question um do you know because I think that it is tough on u.s staff do you know when or why at least um cchl isn't here for the public record so the chief executives are unavailable and as you'll be aware the chief financial officer um is is literally starting here next week so as on leave it was just unfortunate timing in that respect but it is unfortunate too yeah what we really have good questions too yeah need answers yeah but what we reiterated those will again raise it and I'm sure the directors will as well with with the chair so so yeah what's that yeah all right that's what it's like we're told that there's regular reporting on remuneration expectations but I'm just trying to understand how that actually happens because't we we've only been told that's what the market pays we haven't actually seen them report on on that as per one of our measures so do we need to put I mean I don't know what you get as staff do they report every six months on what's happening around the ceo remuneration no they report the reporting that they do they do to counsellors in the generally in the fmp meeting or if there is a workshop and that's usually a verbal report right but it doesn't really go into so if you just look at under 2.4 liter of expectation key requirements periodic reporting on achieving remuneration expectations across the group and so their answer is generally that they do engage with their boards of their subsidiary companies on that issue and that's a that's I would say broadly as much as they can do within the framework the commercial framework that they have for the companies the group so could we ask for example for them to show the trends report on the trends or the what they're paying in terms of senior executive remuneration across senior management are there any other questions we could ask cchl that question to provide some trend analysis so any other questions what I'd be really keen to do is can I just adjourn the meeting for five minutes I just want to take some advice on something that may resolve mike's issue about cchl not being here so can we come back at say five past twelve please oh tim's not here clarity on where we're at um I think the most important thing out of this is and mike raised it uh at the very beginning was the need to have cchl head aunts answer some of the questions um you know I don't think it's useful us beating them up in a public forum um and they need to be here to be able to explain quite rightly is the company that holds our shares um what they're doing and that so what we've done is taken some advice from the team and we we are comfortable that the table today and noting that the amendments are there and that will refer it to the council meeting on the 13th of may um the staff are confident this doesn't slow down anything in terms of our reporting requirements between the organizations but it just gives a bit of time for um cshl to come in and answer the questions that mike and the team have quite rightly raised so I think it's a far better approach um so uh I'm happy to and I mean again I'll be sharing it because leann and andrew will be conflicted and so I'm happy to move that we leave it laying on the table second all in favor against that's carried great thank you and thanks mike for raising that for that valid point okay we'll give it back to andrew okay so moving to our final open agenda item um which is the one outstanding matter from earlier which is I'm just turning through here um item 21 the canterbury multi-use arena elected member update um alastair thank you for um waiting us every two months alongside the capital delivery major facilities report um but we're now reporting this separately um to to call out the significance of this particular project um and so that any information is wrapped in the separate report so we'll take the report as red but certainly would welcome any um remarks or comments upfront just to say that um it's uh the decision to appoint uh the courtoui team and the b6 whatpac team has been um has been found already to be um extremely a good choice uh they have brought so much to the table not only just the it's the knowledge and experience but also the speed and efficiency to deliver on uh tasks and deadlines that we're trying to meet which we're trying to meet a great deal of pace at the moment so to see them break ground with the geotech work on site and the continuance of the decontamination work that we've done is is another step forward um and but in the background there is an awful lot of work being done's great thank you so um thank you for that introduction thank you for the report um now moving to questions yani thanks I had three three questions um one was um given that this is probably the most significant facility that we're gonna that we're gonna build going forward and it will be you know the impacts will be generational is there any opportunity to engage with our youth council or with the city's youth council around design and asked that question yeah before and I said yes we will yeah yeah so okay um and um the other question was reading the integrated traffic assessment it's really clear that we need to figure out where the entrances and exits are in terms of egress before we design the streets around it yep so I was a bit concerned you know that we were making some decisions on some roading improvements ahead of the design around egress what what sort of like at what stage will we know where the um the exit and entry points are so it'll be it will be a june this year we will know what what the concept design will inform the preliminary design the ita uh was done at a time when we were looking at the proof of concept and the proof of concept has been is it was indicative at the time as the location of the um the project structure on the site and the uh the transport team that we worked with and oricona drove the ita the transport assessment worked on that principle on that basis which informed the ltp requirements for the funding in the future years so that's been part and parcel of the whole process we've gone through now we're at a time where we actually confirm or ratify that concept design and that's the piece of work that's underway right now to get a concept ratification so that we can present that to councillors and that's in june this year so right um and then the final question was in regards to the ng building which I see the crowd has now acquired as I understand it it's been acquired so takes responsibility for it lens have the responsibility to deliver the super lock 2 to the project right so um in terms of us wanting to um not make a decision about about the future of that building but to ask how elements of it could be incorporated into the design if feasible isn't that a question for councillors and we should discuss that yeah well that's what I wanted to raise at what point do we have to make a decision on the future of that building you don't lens makes a decision right so the only opportunity we have if if we as councillors feel concerned that it should either be saved or relocated what process do we have to express that so the company that you've that you have appointed in cmua project delivery limited have written three times to linds to acquire the site and the buildings on that site in order to deliver the counterweight multi-use arena so it it'll just be demolished without us having any say it'll be between lens and the owner of the property as the project delivery company have got is that that site will be delivered as a vacant site yes yeah yeah and the responsibility for removing the building from that site sits with linz linz yes thank you so but we approved the design as council of what of the stadium you you will be you'll view the concept that the preliminary designs that develop designs and you'll go through briefing sessions with each of those designs as they go through the process yes right so could we ask consideration be incorporated with the energy bill not at the moment because the cmu apd limited conversations and lens have gone down the process they've gone down to acquire the property right okay thank you sam um thank you just on probably a completely different vein um in terms of the delegations register and the like when are we looking at that coming to us for the board just some clarity I think it's about aligning stars at the moment and getting everyone in the right room at the right time and there is a board meeting on there is some work to be done around acquiring some time for the board to review the current delegation so is there anything you need from us to provide that direction or is it all in hand it's in hand at the moment it's in play no we don't need any direction we know what the direction is but it will come back and then yes it will come in the appropriate time yes yep cool thank you thank you any further questions um so samuel move do we have a second attempt all right so we're just receiving the information in the update is there any debate yani yeah thanks just like to move an additional resolution that the council right to lens to support um this has been moved and seconded we're now in debate so it's an amendment okay so move it as an amendment right yeah just an additional resolution um that basically that council right to linz who I presume another property owner of the ng building supporting it either being retained or relocated if possible point of order within standing orders but or whether it's actually an amendment that can be put because that's inconsistent with the advice we've just received okay can I get some advice from right to lends it's within our power but we don't want to just virtual signal if so can we get the the proposed amendment put up council right to lends yeah um expressing support for the ng building retention yeah or it's relocation or retention or relocation presumably what you want is it it's really just so that as they're going through the design if there's any opportunities they're considered so all right so the question um that I've been asked is whether that amendment is in order is it relevant to the report that's in front of you I think I'm thinking is it completely a question was asked and answered in relation to the report and the question relates to the information that was um raised in the question and provided in the answer so the the amendment is simply asking that that be added an amendment and if it passes then it'll be added to the resolution I don't see anything um telling me that it's unreasonable mary's right it's unlawful just do it anyway take a risk all right mary thank you for your advice um obviously counsellors can decide um whether they give weight to that advice or whether they're happy to write in any case but you've provided the advice thank you um so we'll allow the amendment um all right andrew can I just clarify then so if it's inconsistent with the lga we can still proceed to make a decision on that but where did that that didn't come from the legal advice no I came from an experienced general manager yeah who's the advice I'd take over so we should consider could I just venture a reconciliation between the two pieces of advice from if we were making a decision to retain or relocate the building then what the general manager has said is absolutely crystal clear we would not have sufficient information to make that express support for either the retention or relocation of the young building recognising it's not our decision so um and it may not be possible so it's just expressing support therefore so it seems to me that that that people have enough information based on uh whether they um feel supportive around the retention or relocation of the building in in terms of writing to express that support we wouldn't have enough information to make a decision about whether we could retain or revocate the retention of the building on site affects councils decisions and costs in the future so it does affect it so if that amendment was purely about relocation then you would be absolutely I feel you'd be right but about the retention on the site that changes it completely because there is a cost and a whole change to the project okay all right yani on the back of what has been some pretty informal discussion are you happy with the wording you've got there are you prepared to make a change if you were to take retention out and have retention in given the answer to the question that you already asked but the thing is that we've set up an independent we've set up an independent company to provide advice on us so if they came and gave us advice on retention then that would be different from the situation sure should we ask for advice there no because they they would only come to us if they would have a reason to if we express support for relocation of the ing building they're not that that does meet um that requirement but you could say that um the bots if I could just interject the board have written clear well detailed information four times is it thank you but in the last time two lines exactly why it is that they require the site unhindered so tim's comments in terms of the council expressing a perspective at this point does have implications yeah which the amendment as it currently stands but realizing the wording that's on the screen is different than the wording that you put forward yanny is support for relocation what you put up as an amendment but you've heard the comments in the room and maybe you'll be reading the room as you decide what you want to put forward what do you want to do johnny this is your amendment what do you want council right to lindsay's expressing support for consideration of options to retain it I thought what sarah said was good then it leaves it open and you know but that would be and and um complete even if it was in complete conflict to the company that we've set up to examine with the support to get on with that so would you consider picking up sarah's point would you consider options to relocate or retain the heritage of yeah sure it's just it's just like we haven't even approved a design and I know this this company that we've set up is going to come back to us at some stage with all the concepts to me it would just be a shame if it was demolished ahead of getting that information back so its heritage there's a better way of expressing it sorry what's the point do you not agree with this guys council sorry we're trying to word smith just to make it acceptable but this is your amendment tell me what word you want andrew andrew can I can I just can I just I've just been advised that the issue around the ning building is the subject of legal proceedings that's right oh right and I think that should kill this stone dead so what you're saying is that this amendment should be ruled out of order because it's a matter which is already subject to legal proceedings so the experienced general manager's advice at the very beginning 20 minutes ago well that's that's different than the advice we received at that time but on that basis that leaves me with no option but to realize that that's a little bit disrespectful to our legal advice all right that leaves me with no option I haven't given any advice on contract or anything like that just purely based has now been moved by sam seconded by tim that we received the information in the update is there any debate all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you thank you all right so now I'll move that we um resolve the um now that I've moved that we exclude the public for the reasons set out in the agenda do I have a seconder for that um james daniels all those in favor say aye against as carried you
Um next is the waitai coastal burwood community board and I think um bibi you're you're here today as the um chair of the submissions committee yes I've given kelly some of my speaking time just as the chair of the um I didn't even ask so yeah first really we just wanted to uh thank you for the opportunity and obviously you know bibi who's a very competent submissions chair um we always need to focus on the things that aren't done in our communities and need to be done and obviously that's why we're here but we also need to celebrate the successes that lead us to where we are so the white eye coastal bui wards have seen a lot of successful projects completed either completed underway or about to begin some of these council funded but others were shovel ready projects via the government and still there are private investors also who have projects plans we just want to highlight the fact that hapuna taiwan continues to be an outstanding success uh for new brighton and council I here that you can be really proud of of uh of funding that because it uh it has been really successful yeah and also the new brighton playground the streetscaping etc and the restoration of the clock tower continue to to make that particular part of our area uh look good anyway right along with the uh thanks kelly so um thanks so much for the amount of work that's gone into creating the ltp it's clearly been a huge effort under very difficult circumstances to try and um balance the books uh the board agree that the balance is about right right in terms of the focus of the ltp on getting the basics right which is what people say to us over and over again um a reasonable rates increase um and I think people accept that rates need to increase I didn't hear one person's complaint about the need to pay more in their rates from all the people I spoke to but and therefore spending where it is needed um so speaking of that we're very happy to see many of and I'll call out particularly roading and public realm work in new brighton which has been desperately needed for a very long time we're very happy to see the south shore easter edge project funded and getting underway the qe2 master plan these three projects are earthquake legacy projects and it will be really good to have this work finished and it's really great to see the money there to get this make a commitment to get this work done um so that that new new brighton can feel like it can move on um as well the otakuro avon major cycleway very excited to see that not just for our own wards but that will be an asset for the whole city I'm really excited to see how that's going to look and also the money allocated to the otakuro avon river corridor regeneration planning it's a small fraction of what is indicated as needed but it's a start and it's really exciting to see that work getting underway I know in my own ward we're now talking about you some some movement is finally being made the board also supports the development of the cycle network across the city but would like to see more of these in east christchurch um at the same time I think we need to consider the way we can extend the cyclical network without over engineering so if you look at down fury road I went and had an examination of what's happening down there the other day not is it only as innovative but it's exciting and interesting um and we should think about more things that we can do that help our cycle network without spending tons of cash we're very disappointed to see the reduction in library hours across the city and specifically the closure of aranui library on a sunday um the reason given to align with other small libraries I don't know is library is not like other small libraries it is a hub of the community and that community needs that library and people do use it on sunday I urge you not to do that we are also disappointed to see the person said uh the the fund is crucially important to our communities they and that our community groups deliver amazing re services with the with that money they spend it really wisely they make the money stretch really far they probably spend it 10 times better than we could ever do at council I see over and over again how how far these groups stretch the money groups like attend new brighton project um are essential in our communities and they do amazing work and events like parklands at play I love new brighton a precious tonga and we should be giving them more funding to do this kind of work not least and I'll just finish by saying um uh james and I and linda stuart spent three hours on a bus um traveling around sticks just now we've just come off that and seeing what the um stixx living laboratory have done out there it is amazing and um if you want to see what the avon otica river corridor is going to look like in 10 years time go have a wander out there and christchurch it is beautiful fantastic questions right we'll just open it up for questions um yani thank you um I just wasn't quite sure you've got a line in your submission this has worked with council to improve service delivery at toro qe2 are you able just to explain what you actually mean by that yep you start yeah so there has been some concern about uh improvements a desire for improvements um and one of those would be some disabled toilets close to the hydrotherapy pool and yeah there are members of the board who are have ongoing concerns about those and we recognize that there's not a lot of money in the budget for that sort of thing right now but that's something that we we certainly want to signal for the future right so it's sorry so just so basically that line is just the heading for what's underneath that so that's just the heading line okay cool so specifically around that um have you have you considered approaching like rata foundation or any external funders for support I considering well I think they've made a funding contribution uh no it's not something that that we've considered that's a great suggestion though I don't know how that works because it's a it's a council facility however it would then get I think that that the local community the residents association have taken a lead on a particular part of a philisti facility that isn't yet built that uh they want to have um uh the pools added to modifications made but and so they're looking at different ways of funding that but that doesn't mean that there aren't other ways of um you know obtaining funding so um I'm sure that the um that the staff within the um the team can and I was just going to check on the cost do you know what the cost is I yeah I mean you're saying 500 I thought it was actually 250 but um it was substantial you have 250 250 000. um tim um thank you very much liked your comment with regards to the fury road is really cool so you can get more bang for our buck in the sense if we follow those kind of things which is great um just with regards to the hot pools and the playground and the the the beach side of the road how's the commercial life going and the mall has that spread through the mall as well because part of the theory was that part of our investment as a city is hoping to go through the last thing I saw was a small uptick in fps receipts um not massive but then we've had an unusual year as well so I think we need to see what happens next there's still some more public realm work to do I think so if you look on the other side of the mall that work still needs to be done and I think as that starts to happen which it is then it'll I think we'll get an upward curve after that the the other side of the mall isn't up to where the playground was or something or the playground the mall is still it's not super interesting thank you I think it'd been a three to four percent increase in in gst receipts there's also there are people new businesses uh relocating um I went down to see one at the request of james you know a fascinating lady who's um who loved the vibe of the area and has moved her business from the other side of town into new brighton mall so awesome from wilson yeah I wasn't going to say that james which also has a good vibe yeah yeah okay uh andrew um just quickly because we've only got 45 seconds you're opposing the closure of the hour nui library on sunday currently open from 10 til four in doing that did you look into what the usage at the library is and have you got any comment on that on on a sunday I i haven't looked into the usage and I did reflect on that this morning when I decided to mention it again I think it would be worthwhile to check that is useful is like is it five people or ten people or and if those 10 people really need to be there on a for on a sunday and we're providing a good social service to those people um sometimes there's reasons to keep something open that's not just about volume we'd say the same about absolute transportation I'm say yeah good point thank you look thank you both very much I've met really appreciate you coming along today and um again another very very thoughtful submission so thank you thank you thank you our own cheerleader the next is the waikoura linwood central
Very much indeed thank you okay all right so that now brings us to item 13 capital delivery major facilities elected member updates um aleister welcome to the table and welcome back to the table um we'll take the report as red but um are there any highlights that you want to draw our attention to um not one particular one with the rmc because the pictures are quite old so the old municipal chambers the pictures are quite old and for those that have seen notice there's a huge scaffold going around the facility at the moment and that is to enclose the building in a plastic wrap which means we can start stripping the building internally and externally so it's a really positive move forward for the team and great to see that work being done so that's probably the only real update on across the elected member updates as a whole really yeah great and um yeah whilst there isn't um perhaps a lot worthy of particular note in here it is good to get these reports and it is good to number of these projects um and yeah in particular as you say old municipal chambers and some you know very obvious work going on there which is great to see yeah thank you moving to questions no questions yeah cathedral square are we going to get some sort of report because obviously you've made reference to mb um in the hotel having the exercise area and it um you're saying that thinking about relocating it um and I know that we've also got um and I've only seen what's in the media there's big plans for the old post office building but is there any kind of report that's going to come around what's actually being done bringing all the kind of cathedral square stuff together yep so we're doing a it's a it's a light master plan if you will for the whole of the activities right across each section of the square and one in particular we've we've been doing dealing with the mb and miq facility for distinction hotel and we've got them at the moment which is to take up some private land that's being utilized this can be utilized elsewhere and off the actual square itself which is a good way forward and which will allow us to commence that work in that south east corner and we're working with the chamberlain team and the uh on the old post office building as well with regards to that piece of work which is the south west corner that's yep southwest corner and and that's uh that's a piece of work that we're negotiating with them as well and it all becomes part and parcel of the master plan so it's about tidying the area in the in the north west corner as well which is adjacent the um to pi convention center so we're doing work in that area as well so we're just planning and pulling everything together at the moment in one view right which incorporates the obviously the memorial removal the demolition of the poster of the uh old police kiosk all these sort of things tie into we've had the downtime in between not being able to do the south east we're pulling that together at the moment so that's a piece of work that's underway and we will be bringing that back for review so when are we likely to see um because I think the major said good news story so I mean it is good to see you know more progress and things getting done in the square um end up being tidied up so when are we likely to kind of see what the big picture is for the square he's just said that yeah yeah just what we're doing is uh again is there a date that you know so the project steering groups this friday and so I'll be at that that steering group where I expect to hear from the project manager the full view on the next steps for us which will inform the next elected member member update which will be two months from now um but we'll be bringing a master plan back to council for view to see the moment to try and wrap it all up in one piece yes yep yep and that was uh chris who is the project manager decided that that was the best way forward with that yeah all right thank you very much aaron yeah just something that was raised last week alistair at the disability who he was what week before now um it was changing spaces and with us as a city having a number of major facilities were developing or redeveloping when are we likely to see them go and we were kind of given a heads up on it a couple of years ago so one of the first cities invited into the program and it looks like we'll be one of the last to be in the program yet we're doing the most building across the whole portfolio yeah yeah because to host to be a destination city for the access dollar you we need these spaces in various you'd expect it anywhere that might host anything which is pretty much everything on this list so hornby is included we are we are it for the square at the moment we are so also so rachel who is amazing when you get her in the room without his own teams rachel has is also engaged with the cmua design team now that they literally came on board and she was in the room the next day which is fantastic right so she's certainly been heard and they are including uh to meet those needs and wants for the for the disability community and accessibility community so yeah because the convention center um turned turned down the opportunity it was late in the piece but um and the um the metro sports facility is that is that having a changing spaces or something better I heard it's good I need to ask that question I'm not as heavily if we could get um if you're able to send through some design detail or something to present to that um the disability working group at the next meeting would be real handy just over on this thank you all right thank you jake um uh the in terms of moving that're looking at um releasing that landlord it's not us it's um sergio who is the owner of the spark building and the building across the road also owns the sites at the back of there as well at the rear of that so he's there we've got a plan that john maker from our strategy so what is his offer you guys are looking perfect cool thank you thank you no further oh thank you um following on actually from aaron there's a youth um audit tool that I'm not sure if you're aware of um when uh is there a youth voice involved in in this work yeah so which particular piece okay well well I can definitely talk to the cmua right because I know in the early days of the engagement process we went through we did go and meet the youth group and we presented and we've we've taken feedback from them on the initial designs um I'll be honest that the minute the amount of workshops that the current teams are doing on the hit the ground uh not running sprinting I'd say and there's a lot of um my team and the and the team that's bombarded been on board in the period have been engaged in probably three times a day at the moment in workshop so it's uh there they know what they've got to meet and they know the objectives and all of those entities have been listed as stakeholders to be engaged with at the minute we're in in concept ratification which is more around the structure and the essential outcomes we're trying to achieve so yes they are on the list and there will be there will have an opinion and a voice in the process yeah great thank you okay so um we have got this um set of resolutions in front of us so just receiving the information in the update I'm happy to move that do I have a second pauline any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you now I had
About to go through and on that note could I invite the chair of waipapa papanoi innis community board to come forward we're starting with each of the community boards to make a presentation on the draft long-term plan and I welcome you to the table yanni did you want to interrupt at this point no I didn't but just um like normally when we started hearing we'd have a chance to ask the staff questions so I just wanted to check in terms of the process when you want that can we just put that to one side at the moment I'm just invited the um person to make the presentation some no questions sorry do not think we ask questions to start at the start hearings can we can we just wait until after we've heard from the individual boards thank you good to go too um I'm emma nourish I'm the chair of the waipa papa awareness community board and I've got a deputy simon britton here to help me out today thank you for the opportunity to read and they're going to highlight a few main points from it our waipapa papanoi innis community board is supportive of the overarching proposal especially the focus on transport and water infrastructure improvements we support the council's efforts to keep rates to a minimum and we appreciate the financial challenges council is currently facing but believe that council needs to be undertaking planning now for when there is more financial stability for future long-term plans so on water specifically uh it's just a couple of comments to highlight there as emma said we support the proposed increases in infrastructure maintenance spending including on water networks secondly we do support the excess water targeted rate noting that we see that as a conservation measure and also a further comment on that is we would encourage council to take uh a strong education approach uh if that is implemented uh to ensure it's very clear to the community what it means how it works and also why uh it's being implemented our board is pleased to see increased spending also in the plan to upgrade roads and complaints we hear from our residents we do have concerns over whether the footpath renewals budget has increased enough so that the overall proportion of substandard or grade five footpaths is reduced is it enough to keep up with the rate at which they are deteriorating we are very supportive of the focus on safety for our transport network and for this reason would like to see some projects in our area prioritized due to safety concerns so in the papua new area in particular there's been increased demand on the traffic network due to developments in the area something unfortunately just an apology from us a line and the submission committee's submission was missed when it was entered into the web form our staff are just emailing that through and that was relating to traffic lights at the langdon's road grass road intersection which is something we've raised at council a number of times previously so it's something I know is already on the council's radar uh there's increased development really along the length of langdon's road not just the northland that area and there's more construction starting now beyond that as well so that has raised safety issues in that area and we continue to ask for a solution to the funding and implementation of lights at that intersection secondly northgate road corridor improvements which is a funded project in the ltp we would request there's a bring forward of the spend on land northcote road and the rationale for that is there's two significant developments that have been consented on the what's currently the foodstuff site which is the intersect at the intersection of northgate road main north road qe2 drive so we've got a pack and save supermarket consented to go in at that intersection and also recently we've seen a reveal of the design for marion college which is going in at the back of that site to be accessed from lydia street off norfolk road and we can see both of those further exacerbating what's already a very very high traffic area so we would ask that what's already in the capital program be pulled forward to align road northgat road sawyers arms road intersection we're supportive of that project again it's a funded project in the ltp what we are really keen to see as a board is for that to continue to be aligned with other developments in the area including of course the upgrade to northcott road and also the wheel storing cycleway for hillwood road the traffic patterns across herewood road and soyuz arms road are likely to be impacted by the implementation of that project at the uh grass northgate sawyers corner so you're keen to see those joined up thinking across those projects and the timing of implementation of them our board is supportive of the the way the proposal gives people better options for getting around our city and also the need to lower carbon emissions from transport for these reasons we would like to see the retention of the wheels to wings cycleway where it currently sits in the long term plan we're also particularly supportive of the completion of the northern line cycleway including the safe crossings at langdon's and herewoods roads this existing and there are currently real safety issues around these two crossings the missing link on this cycle way between tucker's road and starrix road also needs to be a priority as many people including primary school students are currently using a track in the grass alongside the railway line we would also like to note the importance of the local cycle connections alongside these major cycleways and would support bringing funding for these forward and the long-term plan another project that's currently funded in the plan is the belfast park cycle and pedestrian rail crossing this is to provide some improved access and safe access for all road users pedestrian cyclists etc for new housing developments that have been taking place and are continuing to be opened up east of the railway line in the belfast area at the moment there are road links you can go the long way around on the road but particularly for pedestrian cyclists and other more vulnerable road users the options aren't great at the moment and there's no off-road link to get through to sort of the northwood area at belfast that has it's sitting in the ltp there's been some ongoing conversations we know between council and kiwi rail in relation to the location uh and design of that project and we continue to highlight the importance and and I guess growing urgency of uh getting that project delivered finally on transport we emphasize the importance of sustaining the ongoing funding that is being budgeted for transport works downstream of the christchurch northern corridor this budget the money on budget for a number of years following completion of the project to deal with the ongoing effects and the developing effects of increased traffic uh in that downstream area and you know kentu it's important to the board for that to continue to be held in budget for the benefit of the community moving now on to facilities in the last long-term plan in 2018 funding for a new community facility on the site of the old shirley community centre at ten shirley road was removed and our board requests the reinstatement of this funding in this current long-term plan we're not asking for a of what has been built to replace many other community centres around the city but would like to see funding for our facility on the site we support the proposal that's in the ltp for development of a youth facility in the papua new redwood area that's currently sitting within rolled up within a larger budget item and our request and this ltp process is just for that to be split out so it can be clearly identified the community can see very clearly what's being committed and when they can expect to see development starting there the council's community facilities network plan has identified a gap in the network in the northern part of our area and we've also heard from the redwood community about the lack of a community missing space in the area the community facilities asset management plan from december 2020 notes that provision has been made outside of this long-term plan for a facility in this part of the city but we would request that budget be included in this long-term plan for a feasibility study on this and then which the board is concerned about those are the proposal to discontinue the mobile library service and we would ask the council to consider to find options to be able to continue that service secondly uh proposed reduction in library opening opening hours uh and we would be looking for some more engagement with communities that would be impacted by that and finally uh we don't support the any reduction in education programs at the city art gallery and finally our board is strongly opposed to any cuts to the strengthening communities fund this fund should be seen as an investment not a cost funding community groups ultimately saves the council expenditure and social support and community upkeep we would like to note that the circumstances behind last year's one-off increase to this fund still exist in our communities and the demand for the fund still remains high and that's all any questions thank you questions jimmy chen one question on uh the 1.7 other facility you mentioned earlier particular light council consider reinstatement funding for community center on your own 10 sherry law but your request how much you it bring forward to the the first year 2012 how much percentage will be the rates the impact I'm not sure what the impact the percentage impact would be activation budget the activation is a small budget it's currently in there further out and we would like that brought forward um so that something can happen on on the site in the meantime until a facility some sort of facility can be built there whatever it is that's in the budget in the future you just want to broadband a year yeah going forward the first day here yeah right yes okay thank you okay well we've come to the um end of the ten minutes so um thank you very much for uh coming today um and I mean it's it's it's really good to see the depth of submissions that you've um obviously put a lot of time into so thank you thank you
Here um item 21 the canterbury multi-use arena elected member update um alastair thank you for um waiting with us so this is the report that comes to us every two months alongside the capital delivery major facilities report um but we're now reporting this separately um to to call out the significance of this particular project and so that any information is wrapped in a separate report so we'll take the report as red but certainly would welcome any um remarks or comments up front oh just to say that um it's the decision to appoint the courtoui team and the b6 what pack team has been um has been found already to be um extremely a good choice uh they have brought so much to the table not only just the it's the knowledge and experience but also the speed and efficiency to deliver on uh tasks and deadlines that we're trying to meet which we're trying to meet a great deal of pace at the moment so to see them break ground with the geotech work on site and the continuance step forward and but in the background there is an awful lot of work being done to get ourselves to a concept ratification phase so great thank you so um thank you for that introduction thank you for the report um now moving to questions yarning thanks I had three three questions um one was um given that this is probably the most significant facility that we're gonna that we're gonna build going forward and it will be you know the impacts will be generational is there any opportunity to engage with our youth council or with the city's youth council around design and ask that question before and I said yes we will yeah yeah so okay um and um the other question was reading the integrated traffic assessment it's really clear that um we need to figure out where the entrances and exits are in terms of egress before we design the streets around it yep so I was a bit concerned you know that we were making some decisions on some roading improvements ahead of the design around egress what what sort of the exit and entry points are so it'll be it will be a concept ratification which is due to be uh is is june this year we will know what what the concept design will inform the preliminary design the ita was done at a time when we were looking at the proof of concept and the proof of concept has been is it was indicative at the time as the location of the um the project structure on the site and the uh the transport team that we worked with and oricona drove the ita the the um transport assessment um worked on that principle on that basis which informed the ltp requirements for the funding in the future years so that's been part and parcel of the whole process we've gone through now we're at a time where we actually confirm or ratify that concept design and that's the piece of work that's underway right now to get a concept gratification so that we can present that to councillors and that's in june this year so right um and then the I see the crown has now acquired as I understand it it's been acquired so that will be transferred over to us or the crown takes responsibility for it lens have the responsibility to deliver the super lock too to the project right so um in terms of us wanting to um not make a decision about about the future of that building but to ask how our elements of it could be incorporated into the design if feasible isn't that a question for councillors and we should discuss that yeah well that's what I wanted to raise at what point do we have to make a decision on the future of that building you don't lin's make a decision right so the only opportunity we have if if we as councillors feel concerned that it should either be saved or relocated what process do we have to express that so the company that you've um that you have appointed in cmua project delivery limited have written three times to lin's to acquire the site and the buildings on that site in order just be demolished without us having any so it'll be between lens and the owner of the property as to what happens to the building so the expectation that the project delivery company have got is that that site will be delivered as a vacant site yes yeah yeah and the responsibility for removing the building from that site sits with lins yes thank you so but we approved the design as council of what of the stadium you will be you'll view the concept that the preliminary designs that develop designs and you'll go through a brief briefing sessions with each of those designs as they go through the process yes right so could we ask consideration be incorporated with the ng bill not at the moment because the cmu apd limited conversations and lens have come down the process they've gone down to acquire the property right okay thank you sam um thank you just on a completely different vein um in terms of the delegations register and the like when are we looking at that coming to us for the board I think everyone in the right room at the right time and there is a board meeting on the 7th which is next friday um and I think there is some work to be done around acquiring some time for the board to review the current delegation so is there anything you need from us to provide that direction or is it all in hand it's in hound at the moment it's in play no we don't need any direction we know what the direction is but it will come back and then yes it will come in the appropriate time yes yep cool thank you thanks sam any further questions um so sam you'll move do we have a second attempt all right so we're just receiving the information in the update is there any debate yani yeah thanks just like to move an additional resolution that the council right to lin's to support um this has been moved and seconded we're now in debate so it's an amendment okay so move it as an amendment right yeah just an additional resolution um another property owner of the ng building um supporting um either being retained or relocated if possible point of order can we can we get some clarity for that's within standing orders or whether it's actually an amendment that can be put because that's inconsistent with the advice we've just received okay can I get some advice it's within our power but we don't want to just virtually signal if we can't do it about it there's no point no so can we get the the proposed amendment put up council rights yep um expressing support for the ng building retention yeah or it's relocation or retention or relocation presumably what you want is it of the ng building it's really just so that as they're going through the design if there's any opportunities they're considered so all right so the question um that I've been asked is whether that amendment is in order um is it relevant to the report that's in front of you I think I'm thinking is it completely a and the question relates to the information that was raised in the question and provided in the answer so the the amendment is simply asking that that be added to the original well we'll deal with it as an amendment and if it passes then it'll be added to the resolution I don't see anything um telling me that it's unreasonable um without complying with the lga decision making that's cool we'll just run the race mary's right it's unlawful just do it anyway take a risk all right mary thank you for your advice um obviously counsellors can decide um whether they give weight to that advice or whether they're happy to write in any case but you've provided the advice thank you um so we'll allow the amendment um all right andrew can I just clarify then so if it's inconsistent with the lga we can still proceed to make a decision on that but where did that didn't come from the legal advice no could I just venture a reconciliation between the two pieces retain or relocate the building then what the general manager has said is absolutely crystal clear we would not have sufficient information to make that decision correct we're simply writing in this resolution to express support for either the retention or relocation of the young building recognising it's not our decision so um and it may not be possible so it's just expressing support therefore so it seems to me that that that people have enough information based on uh whether they um feel supportive around the retentional relocation the building in in terms of writing to express that support we wouldn't have enough information to make a decision about whether we could retain or the retention of the building on site affects councils decisions and costs in the future so it does affect it so if that amendment was purely about relocation then you would be absolutely I feel you'd be right but about the retention on the site that changes it completely because there is a cost and a whole change to the project okay all right yani on the back of what the wording you've got there are you prepared to make a change if you were to take retention out and have a feeling it would get more supporting if you left retention in given the answer to the question that you already asked but the thing is that we've set up an independence we've set up an independent company to provide advice on us so if they came and gave us advice on retention then that would be different from the situation should we ask for advice then no because that they they would only come to us if they would have a reason to if we express support for relocation of the ing building they're not that that does meet that requirement but you could say that the bots if I could just interject the board have written clear well detailed information four times is it thank you but in the last time two lines exactly why it is that they require the site unhindered so tim's comments in terms of the council expressing a perspective at this point does have implications yeah wording that's on the screen is different than the wording that you put forward yanny is support for relocation not retention or relocation it's entirely up to you what you put up as an amendment but you've heard the comments in the room and maybe you'll be reading the room as you decide what you want to put forward what do you want to do johnny this is your amendment what do you want to encounter right to lends expressing support for consideration of options to retainer I thought what sarah said was good then it leaves it open and you know but that would be and complete even if it was in complete conflict to the company that we've set up to examine with the support to get on with that so would you consider picking up sarah's point would you consider options to relocate or retain the heritage of yeah sure it's just it's just like we haven't even approved a design and I know this this company that we've set up is gonna come back to us would just be a shame if it was demolished ahead of getting that information back so all right so to relocate the ing building or retain its heritage is a better way of expressing it sorry sorry we're trying to wordsmith this to make it acceptable but this is your amendment tell me what word you want andrew andrew can I can I just I've just been advised that the issue around the name building is the subject of legal proceedings right oh right and I think that should kill this stone dead so what you're saying is that this amendment should be ruled out of order because it's a matter which is already subject to legal proceedings so the experience general manager's advice at the very beginning 20 minutes ago well that's that's different than the advice we received at that time but on that basis that leaves me with no options but to write it out well that's a little bit disrespectful to our legal advice all right that leaves me with no option I haven't given any advice what mary's just told me so strike it out rolled out of all that as we so this has now been moved by sam seconded by tim that we received the information in the update is there any debate all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you thank you all right so now
And um could I now hand over to dawn vixendale who's our chief executive and uh who will just give a brief introduction to today's hearings thank you man this year we received approximately 2370 submissions on the council's long-term plan this compared to 1503 in 2018 and 2997 in 2015 that was obviously a bumper yeah I although this is my first long-term plan I've been informed that 2015 was the year that the council received over 1 200 pro forma submissions from the eastern suburbs calling for action as well as numerous other performers around asset sales inner city parking red cliffs library and graffiti golf club it is encouraging when our citizens feel passionate about their communities and take the time to tell us what they would like to see for the future of our and their city and this year is absolutely no different over the next nine days you will hear from approximately 330 groups and individuals speaking on a range of topics demonstrating the fact that citizens of christchurch are participating in the local democratic processes this year you know than previous years and this has been reflected back in more focused submissions across a comprehensive range of topics that our communities wish to discuss with the council face to face officers processing processing submissions have identified that in general submissions are more extensive and actually more thorough than previous years all submissions have been sent to our offices for comments on the issues raised and you will continue to be receiving detailed holistic feedback over time this work will feed into the thematic analysis which you will be using as you go through to your decision making process but we have also added or will be adding a policy focused analysis on the issues raised to in the submissions and that will help you when you come to be in your decision-making part of the budget so may I pass back to you to enjoy my first ltp thank you very much um I'm pleased for the opening comments um I wrote a column for the star last week after I'd started reading some of the submissions and I reflected similarly that several residents associations and groups specific items in the capital program they want advance with clear rationale for the proposed changes and I talked about the the numbers of submission that demonstrate in a meaningful way that communities are willing to get involved in the decision-making process and that they're willing to work in partnership with the council to achieve our shared goals and reflected how much I was looking forward to hearing the submissions themselves so I think it does bode well for the process that we're about to go through and on that
Thank you so now moving on to item 11 the asset performance and condition report um so peers welcome to the table now we've got two reports items 11 and 12._``_15.759 we'll take both of them as read we'll deal with them one at a time obviously um but um yeah certainly happy to receive any commentary that you have on item 11 and then we'll move to questions great thank you good morning councillors um I've got a couple of slides here I'm just going to step you through I appreciate that the condition and performance report that you've received is a fairly meaty tome in and of itself I think it was about 60 pages of detail so I'll try and nip through what we've got on here at the moment previously you've received four independent reports and for this particular committee there was a question asked can we bring this together into a single report now um this these reports gave you some um indication of what the value and condition of our assets were and obviously in the three waters valuations and a lot of this work has been focused on helping to understand where the gaps are in the information for areas such as valuation importantly enough we're now moving into performance-based information as well and that's a big maturity step for councils as a whole and particularly this council as we start looking at that I've displayed a number of projects um to you over the previous years that are beginning to drive that that question of how are our assets performing so I think importantly about 63 of those metrics that you've looked at in that report have shown improvement in one way or the other um and that's giving us better uh confidence in the planning capability that we have for processes like a long-term plan what information do we have and how does that underpin where we invest of particular interest for me has been transport area and making sure that the assets related in that report are coming up and we've had nzta technical and procedural report that's come through and they're about our roading path assets in that space parks once again has been a really significant push from the teams to get into much more levels of detail around information about their particular asset base there were some gaps previous reports around some health and safety aspects things like safety rails and the teams really double down in that area to make sure that information is in place I guess it's not all roses and I think the challenges that we have found in doing this particular report which has taken a couple of my team many months to actually pull this together we still have challenges around information to do with our pump station network and our treatment treatment plants of and that's becoming a particular focus for the teams given the valuation space that we had in three waters area we had a 3.87 billion dollar jump in our asset valuation last time around a lot of reasons for that one of which not the majority factor of it was asset related information so we know there's some gaps there this report and bringing this understanding where those gaps are sitting we've got a as I've alluded to we've had a number of projects that have been driving planning type capability for the ltp you'll hear me use this four-letter acronym the double aif project the planning tool that we use for reticulation I did a presentation to that a number of months ago it's those sort of projects that help us understand where the gaps are in the data and that's that's been really important in understanding how that data is used to deliver and de-risk investment scenarios that the staff put together for you council closing those gaps which we talked about and this helps us understand where those gaps are and we're now beginning to understand where performance is so if you have if you remember back there's an a3 sheet that sat in front of that report with a number of areas that we're focused on in particular you can see that there are gaps within performance and that's really you know not a lot of councils are in that back to that simple analogy we might replace a roof on a building we might replace a pipe and we will give that a condition of one it's brand new it's shiny but actually if the roof leaks is it giving us the level of performance that our communities expect from it and so it's that performance and how the data is being used to derive that that information that really helps us understand are we actually looking after the assets in the best way so we're on that journey 19 to 21 we've been developing these reports the next steps for us are automating it as I said it was a huge amount of effort for the team to to bring these reports to you um and we're now in the process of of um automating should get to a point where it's almost push a button and here's the report so we've got a we've still got a journey to go in that and that this little slide here helps us understand where we're actually going and for 2024. what are the improvements and where are the gaps to make sure we de-risk the investment okay on to the sixth monthly report um unless there are any questions sorry uh council attorney do you want to go to questions on on this or yeah let's deal with them one item at a time so we'll deal with item 11 first and then we'll come to item 12 separately um so this has obviously taken some time to get to this point but it's good that we're now here and clearly significant progress has been made um we had previously expressed some concerns that there was a an asymmetry of activity particularly between transport and waters you've um called out a number of issues with some of the water assets am I right in thinking that the three waters area is one area where you'll be putting specific information with the intention of bringing that asset data up to the same level that we've got the the transport asset data correct that that is exactly what we're doing so what the implications of those gaps we have to make a decision do we spend time effort and resource on fixing our laterals data that we've got no because that doesn't figure hugely in the investment and it's actually a relatively small component of the overall asset base however our wastewater treatment plant and the the understanding of our asset base within that that's a critical asset that we need to spend more time on and us understanding how that breakdown occurs allows my team to focus in that area and when do you think we would get to a point where we've got a similar level of um data on water assets as we currently do on transport assets well a lot of the three waters reform is driving the imperative to understand how that data is being used and answered your question timeline I would expect over the next uh six to eight months the pump station environment we should understand the detail behind that gap and that that then becomes a a process of filling filling in the mortar between the brickwork wastewater treatment plant I'm at the very early stages of trying to understand the unknown unknowns in that space and diana diane branch and I've had a couple of conversations around the the next potential valuation that we need to do so you know that it's that valuation work that helps drive what is the information that we hold about our assets yeah and then final question for me um you're proposing to bring this report to us next in april next year um I'm assuming that means that you're intending bringing this report annually rather than six monthly from this point onwards um as far as the program or the condition and performance report the performance and condition report we've got item two sorry item three approve the timing for the next asset condition and performance report to be um submitted to finance performance in april 2023 so that's a year away um obviously this has been coming six monthly given the concerns around needing to bring the water data up to the same level as transport data and the concern around with the work that's been done this should very soon be as simple as just pushing a button to get the report why would you be proposing to bring this annually rather than six monthly I realized you know the alignment with ltp preparation is is one part of the answer but if it's easy to bring it six monthly and there's work going on that would be reporting six monthly why would you be proposing to bring it annually I think it's just the number of reports that you have to receive as the is the main the main aspect and it brings us in into the correct cycle so the the process of bringing a report to you um and the effort that has been required that's one element of it but it's also ensuring that the shift in uh or the change in that data set is actually materially relevant if we if if these numbers change within you know one percent of each other there's not a lot of point of bringing the report at this level of 2023 is two years away not one year away um you wouldn't consider bringing something to us at least in a year's time as an interesting update if you if you would prefer to receive it yearly then you know that's something that we can do happy to do that um what we could do to to lessen the um the paper burden is to do it more of an exception report to say we will bring you the changes that have occurred all the significant changes of which I would suggest that pump stations and the wastewater treatment plant might be an area that you want to understand a little bit more detail we may have that detail by that point okay so that would then see us bringing a um an exceptions report in april 22 and the next version we see this full report would be in april 23 as part of that early stage of ltp 2024 development yeah because I think fundamentally having this report prior to an ltp process helps council understand do we have the right information underpinning the investment counselor that I would be asking me would typically be do we have the capability to use that information to understand where we where we invest and that's the space that the team are trying to operate so I think all of that speaks to that interim exceptions report been brought in a year's time in april 22 and then the full report in april 23. so if we can change the resolution to reflect that um assuming that people are generally in agreement then that would be the way to go all right and pierce from your point of view your team is capable of doing that we're not putting a huge burden on the team just given the comments you made around you know reporting becomes easier the further into this we go yes I'm happy with doing that um the challenge being is to develop the system capability to get to that point and that's the priority for the for one part of my team at the moment to deliver that all right yeah I mean given that we're talking a progress in that space in the meantime yeah all right great thank you all right so is there anything else on item 11 before we move to item 12. um sam and then yani yeah thanks I'm just trying to understand at a really basic level so using that roof analogy you had does that mean things like as we when we get this report back again and you've done more work on it we will get to the point where we're preventing things like the acura sort of issue when you're looking at bricks and mortar so I'll be getting down to that level where you will genuinely know if there is an issue I'm just trying to see that because I get what you're saying about the valuation uplift but as you said the driver behind that was actually a lot of it was unit rate changes in that which pushed it up correct um but we where does this tangibly lead to that that's the um so in all aspects of our business particularly at this level um you more information that we have to an appropriate level because there's a there's a cost trade-off to the amount of money that we invest in that that helps us de-risk the business would it have directly helped acro I can't really talk to that at the moment I think that there are it's a very complex area even just at a practical level though those kind of assets is what I'm trying to get to so so we'll get to the point where you've done this work and there'll be with more information being fed through so that the tangible outcome is uh we can identify these issues a lot more proactively than we currently you can only manage what you know about yeah yeah but yeah without sort of getting into it I guess the frustration is though we've I mean even in my time here we keep talking about this I'm just trying to see when we get to an end date on on where a lot more that information is available well I mean as you can's been significant improvement across the realm so to speak um is it ever going to am I ever just going to be able to hang my coat up and say we're done no it is a constant process of keeping the teams focused on um working on the business to improve the way that they're working in the business aspect so I'm not sure whether that really that's okay yep that's fine thanks thank you yani yeah I mean it's it's a similar line if I if I go to the water supply um you know and and we're told in terms of um the pump stations um water supply pumping condition grade and that's on page nine right um 3.22 how complete reliable is the condition data uncertain and then we've got 28 of water supply station assets not having a start-up date the backlog and an understated valuation we have assessed the water supply data is uncertain I i can't understand and we'll also tell there's a backlog of renewal data with all the get the chlorine out of the water like how can we not have good information like didn't we just go through this whole issue with the contractor and have this huge problem because of it and yet nearly I know two three years on we've still got uncertainty how are we managing that from a risk point of view because it would seem to me that would be one of the top priorities and yet it doesn't appear to have been so um the way that the report and the maturity of the way that we look at information trustworthiness the team have taken quite a pessimistic view that if the information that we hold about an asset lives on a uncontrolled spreadsheet on somebody's hard drive that doesn't have sufficient breadth of visibility across that information we don't consider it to be as trustworthy as having information in sap or gis systems so we take a pretty hard line to say that when we're making critical investment decisions that having information that's derived from an uncontrolled spreadsheet that sits on bob the purposes of this report to be appropriate to bring to this table the usage of some information to derive investment the teams work with the information that they have and they make the best decisions that they that they can as far as why haven't we fixed some of these problems it's these reports that help us understand where the problems are okay so what what what resolution do you need from us to get the water supply network um condition data to a point where we can have certainty in it well I guess this is where the exceptions report comes in if there is a resolution that says that you need to to see um a better understanding of that the information around specific assets I don't think there's a lot of value in saying just bring all the asset related information up to a perfect level unless you happen to have some funding that I'm unaware of the the focal area around these as I said it's wastewater treatment plan and it's pump stations the teams are really focused how that information is being used or not used sorry so when will we get the backlog sorted so the framework was agreed to last week as to how that backlog will be filled it's not just a case of put a list in and upload it to the system they have to agree to the framework of how that information is going to be used otherwise that will drive a lot of cost so I guess it's a bit like the point sam's making though is like this is really valuable information but you know we're currently spending money on all sorts of things doing a long-term plan and having a resident survey so I guess what I'm interested in is like how does this information guide what we invest in as a priority based on the presentation that we had from I mean sorry I can't remember the woman's name which was an excellent presentation that said if you've got things deteriorating you know you need to fix them rather than keep building new things which is what we think new nice new road improvements and yet we've got things that are chronically failing that are not being addressed because we don't have the information well it goes back to a question that I had at a previous committee meeting um your involvement and interest in the information that underlies how these processes run is part of that that value proposition the teams are really focused on driving that information uplift there's we can always do with more resource and investment in that area it comes back down to prioritization within the organization as to where the sets do we build a do we do we invest in a road or a footpath or do we invest in the information about that road and footpath and there's a there's a constant balancing act between effectively back office investment and front of office pathways pools libraries etc that the communities want to see and that I guess is the balancing act that you have when you're trying to look at investment in you know i.t enablement and digital citizen that that is another perennial challenge building a structure or investing in renewal so I can't it's not an easy question for me to answer and that gives me a dollar and I can deliver you a very specific outcome we know where the priorities are and that's what this report is here to highlight for you so do we have any sorry final question do we have any sense of when the water supply pump stations um that data will we we can have certainty in it I would expect by the end of the um the calendar year that that data set should be at a much better state as I said this week the teams have just I believe have finalized the structure of how that information is going to be entered and nothing we can do to speed it up I don't think at this point because the maintenance contract for the water supply and that for the three waters environments being is driving a lot of that as a matter of course and all of that speaks to getting that reported back to us in a year by year end having reported to us in that interim um exception report that we referred to before that all makes sense any further questions yeah thanks peter um just uh 1.1.3 uh on page I don't know what it is 144. um performance there is no performance data currently analyzed for parks and I'm just wondering just wanting to understand that a bit more and also 1.1.5 confirm an appropriate methodology to assess asset performance so can you tell us a bit more about that so the the component of our past I mean it's the same for a lot of the assets that we don't derive performance because we just replaced the assets at an annualized cycle so um bus stations they are replaced quote me on this but every 18 months of bus stations just replace there's no point doing condition or performance related information because it drives a huge amount of cost we just know that you know on average these assets last this length of time um it would be the same for a park bench we we replace park that's you know there's an annualized replacement program that the teams manage all right thank you so jimmy yes patient the just take example uh page 118 here you mentioned the uh value the million dollars this one this date present value or is what kind of value uh for sorry I i can't recall exactly page 118 the value of which assets this this one is like waste water pipe you know you have value this value is after the depreciation value uh well it depends yes it is so if that's the depreciated number that you're referring to in there then yes okay if they're true because you mentioned in 2022 you know you're presented to the council particular emphasize systemize and the automation one I'm not sure if that's true whether those depreciation or technology innovation you are also part of this report or not particularly for the civil security the those asics so are you asking is the systemized approach we're taking taking into account depreciation yes yes uh yes it just depends on how we several years you can see this uh the innovations continue you know continue going so maybe the existing asic cannot meet the future needs it's not not not effectively or efficiently in that kind of factor you also consider is it a factor that I consider in the creation of the report to to use depreciation and also the technology you know innovation I mean the technology can do whatever we need it to do it's really around how we want to display those numbers whether they are depreciated or optimized appreciated or otherwise in that um in that space so I'm I'm not sure and understand quite uh the question okay maybe offline we might yeah all right thank you thank you yes all right so we've got some um recommendations in front of us here we've just changed the wording in um the paragraph three um and if we can just firm that up a little bit actually with an exceptions report to be submitted to the committee just makes it very very clear what we're expecting with an exceptions report I'm happy to be the mover of that do I have a second sarah all those in favor say I against as carried and then moving straight
Um thank you and can I uh welcome submitters to our draft long term plan 2021 to 2031 hearings and just a reminder that we are live streaming uh all of our hearings in relation to the uh draft long term plan as we do with our council meeting so thank you um there are no apologies that we have for the meeting today and no declarations of interest that I'm aware of but if people do have any just let me know tim I'm the chair of the summit road protection authority so I just thought I'd step back right yes so there'll be there'll be the people who might be the member members of the old group that comes up and and various things so if we just note those with the secretariat that'll be great thank you and could I now
Clarity on where we're at um but I think the most important thing out of this is and mike raised it uh at the very beginning was the need to have cchl head ants answer some of the questions um you know I don't think it's useful us beating them up on a public forum um and they need to be here to be able to explain quite rightly as the company that holds our shares um what they're doing and that so what we've done is taken some advice from the team and we we are comfortable that if we refer this we'll leave it laying on the table today and noting that the amendments are there and that we'll refer it to the council meeting on the 13th of may um the staff are confident this doesn't slow down anything in terms of our reporting requirements between the organizations but it just gives a bit of time for cshl to come in and answer the questions that mike and the team have quite rightly raised so I think it's and I mean again I'll be sharing it because leann and andrew will be conflicted and so I'm happy to move that we leave it laying on the table second all in favor against that's carried great thank you and thanks mike for raising that for that valid point okay we'll give it back
Cool okay do you want to run through just at a really high level what you can acknowledging that there's cchl can't_''_8.639 be here to answer their stuff uh in this forum and then what we'll do is no obviously not the council of directors are stepping back and then we'll go straight to questions and then I know yanI's got some amendments which I think this team have come up with um and then we'll see if anyone else got your changes and then move through it so do you want to run us through really briefly me um this is just the drafty so I uh cchl have already come before you with the quarterly report um the key aspects I just want to run through that the financials in the draft statements are draft financials they're still in their business planning um period uh and they will be finalized in the in time for the final soi the cchl report that accompanies the draft sois has drawn out a number of omissions that they intend going back to their subs will all be picked up and we'll reinforce them in the feedback we give to make sure that we've got a record to compare when we get the final sois broadly the financials based on the draft numbers are improved over expectations last year that's all again drawn out in the cchl report most if not all of them have commitments to living wage commitments to diversity uh commitments to executive remuneration restraint uh commitments to group sustainability and carbon reduction noting that's quite complex and they're they're approaching that at a group level and one other uh a key omission that is going to be addressed is the airport's dividend expectations which they took out last year and haven't put back in but we'll be asking them too very good thank you for that lynn is there anything you have to add no I mean just apologize from the cchl team that nobody's here to answer direct questions and we'll take note of any questions which we can give to paul and the team if they arise through questions mike do you want to start thank you it's actually really disappointing that we don't have cchl staff here we've just had um christchurch nz and venus auto tahiti present with both their ce and chair so I've got a couple of questions and I'm going to have questions would be good right yeah but I'm just saying it's actually going to affect my decision I make because I can't make a decision unless I get it okay so to dawn with regards to the the statement of 10 for dcl do you believe this reflects the directive that council gave cchl at the public excluded meeting on the 28th of may 2020 do you believe that the content within the dcl statement of intent actually reflects the directive that council gave um cchl at the public excluded meeting on the 28th of may 2020. if you give me a few minutes I will reflect on that yeah thank you another question um in our letter of expectation to uh cchl um we we ask in there that all members the statement of intent they've actually said that it's going to be a group target and I just want to know the reasoning behind this and actually are we letting companies transition not as quickly as council has requested I think on that particular issue it would be far more informative for a ccho member to discuss that I think the the key issue there is that at a group level bringing targeting it at a group level allows them to manage the different impacts that some are facing more so than others and it gets them it's an intermediate step to get the group as a whole there and then to move to addressing those companies that have quite a lot more exposure to or create much more carbon look in thanks I don't expect you to actually answer the question I'd expect someone from cchl to answer this question um but to me I think they've just let in some of the companies off the hook for doing some work that's actually needed can we just go to questions for now'll guarantee you that well I would love to ask questions if I had the appropriate people here to ask them to okay well I can't fix that today but if you just calm down a weaver that's very so you're actually not participating so can we just stop for a sec if everyone just stops right so right what we're going to say so we turn your mic on yeah yeah so the feedback we had that was that we could add some information if it was useful but not participate in debate and voting right so if it's useful yeah I'm just saying that we we have a and my understanding is that we have a briefing or workshop coming up um with cchl on their climate work um really soon so that might be really helpful yeah thanks sarah that's great any other questions yummy so um thanks um just wanted to check um in regards to the um statements of intent like we we keep seem to repeat the same information around senior executive remuneration and I see a there anything you think we should be asking cchl to in getting their companies to do differently that would get a better outcome um the loe um picked up uh the concern or the request for cchl to ask its subsidiaries to work on closing the gap between the highest and lowest paid cchl sent its own eloise to its subsidiaries before they received our loe and they have said that they will pick those issues up that came through and their feedback to the subsidiary so I would expect that to go through to the subsidiaries but so in the I'm just trying to find the page there's that table that shows there you go it's on page 173 so orion has got no comment on executive remuneration um and it's just got executive communication no specific targets no specific targets no specific targets no specific targets no comments no specific targets and in living wage it's got no comment from cial and you know there's some companies that should be prized for actually addressing it but then there's um other ones it's a tbc so right I just don't know like like how do we get them to set targets oh right so are you looking at the box that uh is in the cchl report yeah so it's quite column 173 and it's the last two columns it's a really good I really appreciate whoever's put this report together that's such a good way of showing um things that we've asked for in the loa um and how they're how they're being addressed um so you know it's really clear but it just it feels like they're just completely taking the mickey out of us in regards to executive reneration where we keep asking the same thing but we keep getting a worse outcome and if you look at the I don't know if you've had a chance to see the information that was sent through but we're seeing you know huge bonuses still being paid and we don't seem to see very much of a reduction so anyway I mean the the short-term subs you will note that last year's annual reports identified some were being phased out um and were basically being replaced by core remuneration and I think that was mentioned at a workshop um that ccho and jeremy and paul attended which basically showed you know that all these market considerations um where scheme where with where they're competing for executive remuneration in the market they are pitching it at an appropriate level um that has not been benchmarked versus the public sector but um it actually has been benchmarked against the commercial operations and I think that's that's the issue so they keep benchmarking against the commercial in the private sector if you look at citicare the remuneration went up a hundred thousand dollars in one year you know that like that's insane a hundred thousand dollars in one year at a time when we know groups yeah I mean so I get this complete sentiment and I've got amendments to that effect cchl aren't here to answer these so I mean if there's a a way in which you could I'm not sure basically having got our staff over it is the most useful way of doing it right so basically yeah I've put up an amendment that we um you know that we include some feedback um because there should be able to be target set particularly around that relativity in terms of top to bottom so that's really useful so if you've got any more questions and then we will get to your amendments as well yeah could I just perhaps um add that on yeah you can if you have to I'm just what I want to do is give everyone the chance to ask questions um so does anyone else the only other question I had oh does he know I thought jake did you not ever oh right just the usual it's just a bit hard not having cchl here let's just think it's done fear on our staff for this so I'm sorry mr chamber but I just think this is that productive yeah yep melanie yep I'm just flagging and sent through another'll fold it yeah that's useful um does anyone else have any questions jimmy um on page 173 regarding to the ccha accessory company some of the comments you know based on these five categories no any comments I don't know what I mean and why what I mean is a commitment for those uh kind of uh uh target of course or is that you know I i don't know and also what is the cch or the attitude regarding the issues exactly the same question yanny asks yeah is there any other question yeah yeah so yeah so so let's stop again is there anything in addition to what you already answered that you can provide to jimmy to give him some reassurance I could just um repeat that we are no no no no anything in addition no okay yep no cool right james okay thanks tim new question do you know because I think that it is tough on u.s staff do you know when or why at least um cchl isn't here for the public record yeah that's not yeah I mean I I'm aware yeah so the chief executives are unavailable and as you'll be aware the chief financial officer um is literally starting here next week so as on leave it was just unfortunate timing in that respect but it is unfortunate too yeah what we reiterated questions too yeah need answers yeah but what we reiterated those will again raise it and I'm sure the directors will as well with the chair so so just in the um we're told that there's regular reporting on remuneration expectations but I'm just trying to understand how that actually happens because like from I guess from my observation like we don't we we've only been told that's what the market pays we haven't actually seen them report on on that as per one of our measures so do we need to put I mean I don't know what you get as staff do they report every six months on what's happening around the ceo remuneration no they report the reporting that they do they do to councillors is a workshop and it's usually a verbal report right but it doesn't really go into so if you just look at under 2.4 letter of expectation key requirements periodic reporting on achieving remuneration expectations across the group and so their answer is generally um that they do engage with their boards of their subsidiary companies on that issue and that's a that's I would say broadly as much as they can do within the framework the commercial framework that they have for the companies the group um so could we ask for example for them to show the trends report on the trends or the trends in the market or the trends the trends of what they're paying in terms of senior executive remuneration across senior management are there any other questions we could ask cchl that question to provide some trend analysis so any other questions what I'd be really keen to do is can I just adjourn the meeting for five minutes I just want to take some advice on something that may resolve mike's issue about cchl not being twelve please
Britain street okay um so back to amanda all right let's just swap your seats now then I'll be back after this okay um so quick summary again and move to questions sure um so this this is a building which is not scheduled in the district plan um but it does have um historical social and architectural significance it's a landmark in linwood really because of its location on a sand hill and with its landscaping of concrete walls and steps the house needs re-leveling and maintenance and repair work the current owner purchased it last year and um didn't receive any insurance money for those earthquake works so um this grant she's looking to have some assistance with those costs that she's taken on by taking on this building which she wants to retain for its values thank you very much melanie you have a question um my question was just why um is it not listed in the um district plan as a heritage building uh well it quite possibly would meet the threshold based on the initial research and assessment potentially hundreds of buildings which aren't on the schedule yet but which meet the threshold we just haven't had time to research and assess all of those yet so there are many more possibilities out there thank you tim um the the current owner purchased this as is wearers that was advertised as is that correct I'm not sure if it was advertised as is whereas but that that was the circumstances that she said it was brought in as is beerus thank you any further questions like the the cost estimate in there to to repair 130 000 um is that everything that needs to be done to the house and then it's up to I guess an insurable livable standard uh yes as far as I know okay okay any further questions no in that case I have jake as mover of a second or melanie um debate tim yeah thank you um this is I think very different to the point to the previous one whereas the previous one was a a recognised heritage building this isn't it was bought one would wearers and um generally when you walk through a house that needs re-leveling piling and foundations you're pretty well aware of it I certainly was aware of mine there I would um I can't support this I think that this is one for that your owner bought with your eyes open and we should be preserving the money for heritage for recognised heritage buildings thank you melanie um I will obviously be supporting this um it's um just because it hasn't been recognized in the district plan doesn't mean it doesn't meet the threshold it just means that the work hasn't been done yet to put it there um so um and I think this one has a lot more heritage value than the category one doors of the street that I supported as well so I think this is not a lot of money and um it's you can see from looking at the building it's clearly got heritage value and based on what's in our report thank you any further debate jeremy sorry thanks uh just briefly look uh my view is that there needs to be a line in the sand if it's not on the register then I find it hard to justify it especially when there are some on the register that very narrowly only straight through so no support from me thank you any further debate no in that case I might sorry echo what tim said I have concern when um you know we have applications from people that buy properties at a very low rate because they're as is wearers um and then come to council with with their hand out to help them do them up colleen and I said yeah the thing is that someone could buy that say okay I could pay that for that and apply for a council grant and I could save the building so I'm going to support this thank you james just trying to think that through the day the building is safe yeah I got that bit um I think it's a valid point and therefore I'm uh not going to be supporting this recommendation okay is there case um all those in favor please say aye those against division councilor mcclellan councillor mcdonald's no councillor joe hanson councillor galloway councillor daniels oh no councillor coker yes council of achievement no council is scandalous no cancer cure um that's great thank you very much
Do you guys want to come up to the table welcome joe and therese and thanks for making the time I know you've got uh another appointment as well so it's great you can come through I think we can largely take it as red but do you want to just run through anything at a high level and then we'll open up for questions if anyone has any I'm kind of keen to keep the meeting moving if we can good morning um I just wanted to run you through uh just a few um points part half part of the report is uh the half-year report to 31 december and I would just note on that that cnz has been successful in achieving further central government funding than expected I also want to refer back to the workshop which was I think last week and note to you that we we have taken into account uh or we will in the feedback provided about this funding needing to be updated both the third party and the ltp funding there were just some anomalies that that need to have benchmark targets put in which cnz is working towards achieving they're currently working on the urban development work pipeline which won't be completed in time for 30 june but will be well progressed and the only other comment we would raise is whether the soi should have or would be useful to have the breakdown of funding allocation to the particular activity groups in the soi uh acknowledging that though that's an indication of the allocation and may change but that gets picked up and reporting and becomes very transparent and that's all I wanted to say great thank you very much joe or therese is there anything you want to run through yeah just just very briefly thank you chair um I just want to thank you all for the input that you gave us during the workshop session last week as linda said um that feedback will be incorporated into the next version of the draft it was very useful feedback and in particular in relation to multicultural committees so thank you for that um the performance measures that are as linda said we're well on target and we're very pleased to be able to present this to you today and then the statement of intent obviously looks at our activity over the next three years and is aligned with the level of funding that has been outlined in the draft ltp and gone out for consultation happy to answer any specific questions teresa is there anything you wanted to add or um I would echo what joanna has said it's been a great first half and we're really looking forward to getting our soi locked away and continue to deliver that for christchurch right thank you very much are there any questions yeah I i note that you've got a partnership with the crusaders um and noting that we've got like a home final coming up have you got anything planned I mean do you have like I just remember back in the rainfall shield games the city you know used to get really excited about a final or you know a key game and there used to be a lot of central have capacity to do that one-off sort of special events promotion um yes we do and I don't want to be presumptuous about the performance of the team because we have no control over that but what we do control is the way that we reach the crusaders audiences so that the partnerships are directly designed to reach the largest possible audience which we largely do through the broadcast audience if we are in a position to be celebrate celebrating holding the cup and then we may look at tactical activations to reach our own residents as well but in terms of the game day or the or people coming to the city do we do anything to say I wonder just in terms of what we're trying to achieve here it's probably a really detailed question that maybe you could take offline with joe and the team I'm just conscious we have got I mean it's it's a really operational thing just so much okay so the other the other question was just around the um the buskers festival um the bread and report around the expenditure and the attendance and kind of an evaluation of how it's gone now we report through to this committee on our on the performance that is captured within our levels of service and our statement of intent that incorporates the busker's performance we would need to hold a special session in relation to buskers at your request it's not part of our normal reporting great okay thank you anything else jimmy uh the let's review the uh the 4.5 the third bullet point I'm not sure in here why mention the miss commitment reduce the organization specific carbon emission by 2045 I remember based on council loss later about the the expectation is for consumed by 2030 there is a carbon emission neutrality in iraq is rather than 2045. and this is the target that we've been given in the letter of expectation and um if you want to revise that you'll need to let us know with a revised letter of expectation okay okay we did discuss that at the workshop that we had and we um noted uh in the loe for next year for christchurch new zealand yeah thanks that's what we have been through okay so thank you uh who would like to move this sarah would like to move it who would like to see him but jimmy would like second is there any discussion yanny yeah thanks um I do think it would be good to get a formal report back on the buskers festival um when we agreed to the new format we did put in quite a considerable investment um and I think it would be good just to kind of understand how that's going now obviously code 19's had a massive impact but it just seems to me that um for the level of expenditure that we put into something with an expectation of getting a certain outcome it would be really good to see how that how that's going so I don't know how others feel about that but that would certainly be um we do have some very limited information in the six monthly report but it's certainly not not detailed enough so the only other thing I'd say is I mean that workshop last week was really really all the week four was really really useful and I know you're on the same page when you talk about tangible measurable outcomes and we certainly look forward to that being delivered so thanks very much for making the time to come in we really appreciate you both here as chief exec and chair so
Sounds sensible um though we're not making no there's a recommendation from the trust I don't see where there's an actual conflict okay that's fine yeah it's not my decision on whether you feel conflicted or not okay excellent we'll just keep forward keep moving forward then um so sam could you give us a brief summary curacao yeah sure um so the means roughly charitable trust received a bequest many years ago and it's been slowly accumulating in the in the trust accounts and it's currently 690 thousand dollars but because of the low interest environment it's not returning a lot to the trust so the committee um which two councils here are on as representative and a whole lot of uh representatives from social agencies discuss the best use of it uh staff recommendation was to use it as grants over a five year period to help those uh experiencing hardship and distress others on the committee felt we could it could be invested to give long-term return uh with one possibility being into community housing to also report in front of you has the committee recommendation to asking council to to ask staff to investigate investment options and there's also a staff recommendation as discussed to use it as grants so should council go ahead and choose to ask staff to investigate investment options a report would return in a few months time with some of those options and the option to distribute the bequest as grants over five years time for you as a council to decide the way forward and then the committee would go ahead and um continue on with with that delegation thank you and when could you get that information back to us uh we're hopeful we could come back in at the july meeting which is our next meeting yeah that's great thank you jake um I guess a small matter why is this why have you sought to write a report to ask us for permission to go investigating different options as opposed to just investigating the options and then bring you back two-fold one is it can take quite a lot of staff time and work all that investigation and discover that council have no interest in them as well for charitable trust making an investment then that's been a pointless body of work so we wanted to get the direction of council um it's it's your delegation rather than the committees and with it we'd go ahead and do that work but we didn't think it was worthwhile putting that work in if it didn't have any interest to us counsellors thank you tim as this originally came and so part c is what we discussed with regards to changing the the initial with which was putting and investing it into social housing would we not be better just to get some feedback on the economics or the investment environment at the moment and being that being brought back to council because originally this was to invest into social housing which I obviously we've changed it so rather than a report could we not get some we've got um christchurch nz which have apparently have a very good feel of the investment cycles we've also cchl staff I'm just wondering about that I mean this has just happened this morning the changes so so that would be part of a report to include um back to you the investment environment okay that would inform the actual decision thank you in july thank you yeah sam can I just ask um in the report you say you received 750 requests for support in 2019-20 a year totaling 358 800 of the grants how much do the requests total uh it's not quite that simple because we don't ask for a specific amount what are you requesting yeah it'll be a bit variable say for example a typical request might be a highly overdue power account which has been increasing sometimes up towards of two thousand dollars owing uh and and we'll work with that person and with some other agencies to try and you know to ensure they don't get their power disconnected and we might grant say six hundred dollars so I couldn't tell you exactly what the requests were for because people don't come with a set to assist so are you turning people away because of lack of funds or do you find the fund is sitting in there it's pretty well balanced in terms of what we've got coming in on an annual basis and what we're granting out but there is there is greater need out there but we we control the the in the the point of request that has has some funnel to it uh with with greater funds we could increase that funnel and increase the amount we could um because currently um what are you bringing in from the dividends and strengthening communities is is it 300 and something it's around it varies but it's around about 350 000. quite close to what yes it is thanks to your director's fees and the strengthening communities so you wouldn't be dipping into the the quest money very much every year we're not as no because we currently that's set aside and under kind of a different delegation so we don't dip into it a small amount of interest that is returned the committee you know distributes grants to help more people because we then could dip into it should that decision be made yeah and just one more question if I may with the government's winter power grants are you seeing less people having to come for power would you anticipate you'd see these people because that's a reasonably generous amount isn't it yeah I think it changes maybe the timing a little bit so we're seeing people now because it hasn't kicked in yet uh and then what we find in winter we we often do a little bit more in the firewood space than in the power um and then once that with the fuel package comes off um it can it can kick back in again for people so yeah it does does change it a little bit but still some people get themselves in and they find themselves in a really difficult situation and that winter fuel package isn't enough to to get them out so that we still see that thank you thank you any further questions pep james there now the recommendations are up there now okay with a sec and you've got the second tee and phil pot and one now yeah thank you no I wanted to just say that the committee is supportive of this because we're aware of the the growing need um people are coming to the miz welfare to talpua which means support and that need is only going to increase so there's that tension between being able to respond to that need but also to sustain the the fund so that we can continue to respond in the future so this is about investigating options for maintaining the fund so I'm really happy that it's going to be supported today and we look forward to the report but I'd also like to acknowledge the work that sam and brian pegler do in this space brian particularly is the front person and deals with those who come needing assistance and is incredibly compassionate and supportive and I feel very proud to be chair of this committee it's uh we do some great work so thanks happy to support this because um I think this is what it should have been the beginning to invest to look at any in all investment processes with regards to increasing the amount available to the needy and who who requires it rather than just concentrating on social housing so which it was originally so I'm really pleased to support this thank you um yeah even andrew yeah um yeah I'm happy to support this although I do think um you know it I hope this doesn't um get mean that we don't look at the housing just to show you the housing register from 2018 10 000 people going up to 22 000 december 2020. so there's a massive need for housing uh social housing affordable housing community housing in our city um and in our country so I just wanted to um you know say that I think we should certainly be looking at what we can do but you know I think this is sensible that we look at what's the best option to create a sustainable income source for the and currently just having money sitting in a bank getting very little interest is not really a very sensible use of that resource so I welcome this and support it thank you thank you um a sustainable approach would definitely suggest considering investing this for the long-term benefit of the fund um rather than simply distributing as grants at the current time although I accept and respect the comments made by anne around the tension that definitely does exist there and I think it's important that we keep the distribution option alive to consider once we've got this report back a sensible approach would be to consider all reasonable and viable investment options which should in my view consider investing in social housing if that is a secure investment with reasonable returns and I'm sure that's something that will be considered um the key is that this is about investing sensibly for the long term benefit of the fund if there can be a follow-on benefit for social housing that delivers additional social outcomes then um that's something I certainly would welcome I think it is simply asking for the investigation to be done we're not making an investment decision today I welcome the results of the investigation coming back to us so that we can look at all of the options that that puts in front of us so that we can then choose to invest for the benefit of the fund and so that the great work that the um as welfare fund is able to bring about is able to continue thank you anyone further no in that case I'll put the recommendations all those in favor please say aye any against no degree that carried thank you very much
As carried and then moving straight on to item 12 for the asset management improvement program six monthly report and I'm guessing piers that takes us back to your presentation it does so I've tried to sell the just sell it down so we have been closing out a number of um pieces of work the first one of which is the is the asset management plan as part of the overall ltp program very challenging piece of work um the templates and the bringing together all the different organizational components has been has been very challenging and obviously there's a lot of the information that's used in that these amps and the process used not only is the quality improved in my in my opinion and in some of the external audits that we've had of them but it's helped us understand where some of the challenges are within the business we have lots of documents now but it's us understanding how we're going to improve on the capability that sits behind that pile of paper so more importantly for me more um strategic viewpoint for things like resilience and climate change and really getting the teams to understand what does that actually mean in the context of an asset management plan for 3.5.2 there are strategic asset management plans so if you can think about this as the the asset strategy that links into all the other pieces of work whether it's within the um the three waters team you know the integrated three water strategy the infrastructure strategy the financial strategy we've got lots of strategies and this helps distill the the perspective for the asset plant now we've got asset plans that for the first time in our history have been published externally I'm not sure that there are a lot of constituents out there that sit there perusing over the hundreds and hundreds of pages but the asset management plans themselves being published has actually shifted the way that the teams view that document it becomes more of a living document because somebody might have eyes on it and may ask a question of them as to how the assets are being managed act that we're looking after our assets so this these two these two pieces of work done in conjunction with one another we've used the teams to help us understand strategically how the assets should be managed and where some of the pressure points are and how do we link that into the rest of the process that's ongoing moving on to the next impact project that's really completed you had a asset maturity report that came out you've seen you've seen that that's quite a significant piece of work in and of itself and you can see that where the teams have invested in there you get the biggest returns and that's obviously around the asset systems and the information that we use that's that's the that's the area of focus for my team and also for a lot of the other teams um the other project that was um that we've completed out recently I tried to put a diagram together so um we had a white paper that came to the committee which was trying council looks like and what are some of those priorities and we you know the focus is building trust in that information that comes through there's no point me putting a report up if you can't trust the information that sits behind it we're about creating asset management insights so that's some of the planning tools that double aif for instance that are reported through we try and bridge the technology and the business in their asset management function and that's obviously to improve the capability and de-risk the business as far as the outcomes we don't want to have 15 sources of truth where everybody's arguing that that's the truth we want to provide information and go that is the authoritative space we want effective governance and oversight so it's part of this presentation today and more importantly we're trying to take a whole of asset life approach we build a structure we do a capital investment and then the cost of managing that structure over its 100 150 200 year lifecycle that's where the real opportunities come we're trying to look at how do we understand the information that sits behind it and then obviously around organization-wide asset management leadership I try and put that exciting subject onto the table of everybody I can and sometimes that's challenging but having these reports coming to you and your engagement forms part of that that system and then obviously underneath it we're there to develop competent motivated staff in this area so that project completed um and that's really providing a framework for how we move forward with each one of the asset management teams looking after those assets for communities well I guess whilst there's a lot of detail that sits in the program I guess the takeaway from this is that we are progressing projects we are moving through the system the quantitative measurement that we provide you through our maturity assessment report that hopefully gives you trust that through external audits progress is being made and that there is a program and a systemized approach that we're taking to improving the asset capability and the oversight that we provide into looking and supporting the teams across those outcomes I think that's pretty much about it as far as the program I'm happy to take any questions on the program in and of itself all right thank you very much other questions on this report all right so we're just moving to receive this which I'm happy to do um jimmy chen seconds any debate all those in favor say aye against as carried piers thanks very much indeed for presenting these to us today and to you and the team for the work done in pulling these reports together thanks very much indeed thank you
Thank you very much okay and now we move back to uh the heritage incentive grant for five shelley street welcome victoria right um thank you very much so we'll do the next one here um so if you'd like to just give us a quick summary and then we'll go to questions thank you yes thank you um okay big one to follow um I'm here with a report in front of you that recommends the committee supports the retention of the little brick cottage at five shelley street by approving a heritage incentive grant fund for maintenance works to keep the building weather tight and in constant use this little brick cottage is a very prominent key feature in the local landscape it's part of the identity of the neighborhood it's also very important contextually because it tells the story of the development of sydenham specifically of shelley street's creation and its development into a residential suburb the owner of the cottage has spent the last 10 years plus out of the building fighting with her insurance company trying to get insurance write-off_,_101.04 she's now got a settlement in place and the works have begun but she's been left with certain elements that didn't get funded which were considered to be pre-existing damage that was rotten timberwork and joinery to the back of the building defective weatherproofing and flashings and the need for a new roof and she's come to request an incentive grant to help support those works that weren't covered by the earthquake funding that's great thank you very much do we have any questions on this one no questions okay then do I have a mover time so you conduct melanie any debate no those in favor please say aye those against declare that carried thank you very much
Um and bruce staying with you for item 10 the financial performance report for the nine months ended 31st march any commentary on this one yes in december we reported to you a a optimistic forecast um position for operating result of 6.2 million that has steadily improved over the last quarter months on month we're currently looking at a significant surplus of 19.1 million in fact I've just seen the april forecast as 22.1 million um so there's been a we're looking potentially at a very good financial position this this year in terms of optics um it's driven by a number of things um some of it is covered related some of it relates to us being slightly conservative in our budgeting because of covert that looks at things like facilities revenue where we were slightly conservative and the revenue has been better than we expected um subvention credits we didn't expect any this year or the next two years we've relooked at that and we received a 2.2 million subvention credit last month and we're expecting that you know about the ccho dividend um parking revenue is probably the one detractor that is down slightly in a city parking outside of covert there's things like these consenting volumes where we predicted a slow in consenting due to a supposed recession in fact where our consenting revenues and associated expenses are significantly higher than we expected there was the extension of the burwood landfill which has generated additional revenue partly offset by some costs at the same time we've had quite a tight control on our costs in fact our costs are forecast to be slightly under budget this year they've been well managed there are some costs as I mentioned that are up around consenting and build landfill there were some savings in the recycling and organics area around the way in terms of volumes being down and the way those were handled um so as I say very good forecast financial position and that will have a positive impact potentially on next year's rates in terms of the ltp in terms of capex I won't_''_184.0 I'll go into that in so I've been open to questions excellent I mean I think the key message is that this is a good news story um that 22.1 million surplus as noted in paragraph 4.3 of the report will go to debt reduction is greater than the residual covert debt that was planned to be drawn down in the next financial year which means that there won't be a need to draw down any further covert debt um that obviously has a flow-on effect to the rates in year one of the ltp which is very positive um so there's a lot of what you've just told us that um you know very positive information and does reflect good news both in this report but more particularly um for year one of the ltp and the rates impact so um thank you for being the bearer of good tidings moving to questions are the questions on this report sam just a quick one thanks bruce I agree it's it's good news the only thing was in 4.3 um the interest expense overstatement in the draft ltp so for consultation or uh that should actually read an interest over statement in the annual plan yeah it didn't current using your plan okay cool yeah yeah so that's not and so not consult like we've already I guess what I was hoping was we'd get to the ltp and we've got more savings sorry figures in the ltp are correct they will improve slightly with the reduction in covert borrowing of course okay cool damn I thought we'd found another three million thank you yanni um while I appreciate this is good news in terms of the budget I guess the two areas that I'm concerned about is the fact that we're underspent um in water maintenance of two million dollars this is on 5.4 and 5.3 um broading for us timing of maintenance so two of the kind of key things that we're really concerned about and we're under spent um so given what we've you know we're discovering with some of the water issues that we've had how can we be in a position hoping helen was still here it might be a question that if we haven't got somebody in the room we can answer it now we need to take offline and provide information um by email yeah I mean I'm happy to get informations but I just would have thought at a higher level though where we've got um huge dissatisfaction with footpaths we've just had the report that shows you know a huge number of complaints around the condition and um denton which I haven't seen this sort of close out report what happened at denton um but also we know what happened in accorole we have seen that report around um you know things not not being done because of budgets and yet we're under spent so I guess I was just really interested in that high level how does something like that happen and as the system's in place so that we do spend that budget to ensure that we can address those priorities and I think there are you know things that we'd probably expected to be addressed within the work hasn't been done or does it mean the work has been done but it's costless but then if we've got a surplus are there other projects that we could be bringing back to use that surplus if we're in a constrained environment where there's work that we naturally would be choosing to do if it was affordable so if we can pick that type of thinking up in the um written response back that would be helpful because um and underspend doesn't necessarily mean that the work hasn't been done it may be that it has been done but more cost effectively so I would add to that uh chair is that actually in the finance report where we have those things that uh council hanson is right in terms of questioning and he did this last time as well is that there is a specific comment in the finance report over something that might be perceived as not a good thing so what are the facts around it either that actually we've got better pricing or whatever it might the fee whatever the result is put it in the report so that he doesn't have to keep asking the question yeah great just the other thing I mean just um in the revenue really really good to see um um and I think we've we've had have we had some information back on how that's performing I think we have haven't_''_470.96 we around what we're expecting but um the reckon sport revenue is I didn't quite understand what it meant by due to the release of revenues from the balance sheet what is that just an accounting kind of yeah effectively it is it's revenue that we've received in prior years that we haven't recognized right so it's being released from the balance sheet I'd sorry I'd have to look at the the reason for that what page is that um that's on page 91 thank you I can answer that it's to do with consenting and we hold the revenue there's always a slight delay between when it's received and when the refunds have to be paid and there was just this year that prior year's revenue was released that's what that relates to all right with covet and memberships and things well not necessary but it's just a normal delay but um it's because if we release it all at once there's chances are if we have to issue credits there's a small refund all right okay thank you thank you no more questions james kiara bruce look I'm not just because it's been raised I just want you to confirm regarding hippuna taiwana the hot pools I understood and as I say I haven't had a look in here um I understood that they're in profit they're forecasting a profit for the year whereas they were um budgeting for a loss of something like 700 is that right yeah sorry I didn't catch the the first part of the question maybe if you could repeat the question james okay and keep just wanting to confirm it was raised about to hipuna taiwana the hot pools in new happening with it financially I understand that it's in profit when it was budgeted to make a loss of something like 700 thousand dollars is that right yeah I haven't_''_588.64 I haven't got the I can't answer that question in detail sorry again that might be one that we'll answer um offline by way of um an email but certainly in the report um paragraph 5.2 one two three fourth bullet point um is showing um higher revenues of 0.6 million so that's there in the report but it will be good to see how that's tracking against forecast yeah yeah so if we can get that information again just emailed around that would be perfect so it's absolutely outperforming its forecast but whether it washes its faces a different issue yeah so outperform the forecast is it enough to bring it into um surplus or does it still mean it's operating in a deficit yeah let's get that um offline it was more of a statement than the question actually okay yeah um aaron yeah the um the lower's it sorry you're a mystery why why is that little revenue on parking down my understanding is simply volume related on and off street parking revenue is lower than budgeted I'd have to get the business to answer any more detail than that right that's correct we've had um lower than expected uh revenue because fewer people have been parking so fewer parking we have fewer car parks yes we've had lower than expected so it's occupancy so this is driven by occupancy of the car parks that we've got that were the basis of the forecast not because there are less car parks available for use yes it's a combination of the car parks and on the street but overall it's below what we were forecasting yep that's clear right so would that be suggesting we're charging too much to park and that's why people are not using them do we look into that at some point okay so it'll change when young people start driving I know so I don't know whether there that particular outcome it's something that might be relevant to considerations I mean car park charges form out of the um ltp um so maybe it might be worth anticipating that this would come up as part of a ltp conversation yeah because mr chair something I've raised each time we've removed on street car parking is that it doesn't um it doesn't trigger a financial implication which is a little bit alarming that you'd take away an asset that returns you several thousand dollars a year but it doesn't that doesn't count as a financial implication where I believe it should okay so that could be it but it might not be so it'll be good to know because mike might be right maybe the buses are full and uh so we seem to have moved well beyond questions at this point but I think the points made um and yeah it will be interesting to know what it is that's driving that um I mean what you're talking about is how the forecasting might have changed as we're talking about here is the uptake and the revenue from those car parks which are available been lower than expected because of less use than expected and two different matters but both of which are capable have been picked up as part of the ltp okay um any other questions jimmy maybe this is a silly question but I still like to ask a star if we review those the two pie charts you know I'm just concerned for instance like it looks like if we contribute more capital expenditure then we probably will be reduced big number big amount of the operational expenditure four instant ligo with three waters waste water water supply storm water capital one we contribute 12 to 7. three percent and then we spend a lot for upgrading cost however the welding and the full path we contribute for 23 percentage then those operating expenditures only spend for 16 percentage and also the transportation no capital expansion eight percent dg then operation a pension is a three percentage so I just don't know what's the reason there those one these charts are just trying to give you an idea of where the spend is occurring for optics and capex and to some extent um they don't change a lot it takes a lot to change them in terms of you know a lot of money needs to either be not spent or additional spend to actually change that pie chart much and I think to some degree they just are what they are and they reflect they reflect you know the budget decisions you've made and then the spend decisions um so jimmy this is simply reporting back situation because I'm concerned that for instance routing and the full pass you know the actually you know it's a those percentage is relative is low whether it's a still can regular quality of maintenance those so I think what you're talking about is a discussion that's more relevant for the ltp than this report back that we've got today the balance between capital expenditure and um the need for maintenance and where we choose to spend our capital area by area they would report today this is simply reporting back on budgets that we've previously put in place um if we felt that those budgets would be put in place differently then that would be a matter for the long-term plan okay thank you thank you anything else all right now I'm happy to move receipt of this information do I have a second before that james goff all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you so now moving
Very much all right there are no deputations by appointment no presentation of petitions so now we move on to paper seven the proposed consultation on freedom camping by law changes welcome thank you thank you very much um you can take the reporters read but if you could give us uh the the quick update on the um the government's new plans and why we're still going ahead with this that would be really useful sure um do you want me to do a summary of the file of changes very quick um so I guess the main point with the bailout is that we need to review it and we need to complete the review otherwise the bylaw will lapse um so we've been working on this um for some time and you had a report about this in october last year which is the first step in the review this is the second step um so we've got some um changes that we're recommending which um generally we think the bowler is working quite well but the review gives us an opportunity the meantime since um preparing this work the government has proposed changes to freedom camping nationally um these proposals will likely lead to changes to the freedom camping act which this bylaw is made under so the key point here is that the national changes won't be finalized for some time um perhaps late next year by the time the legislative changes go through so we need to complete the review of our bylaw including this consultation phase at the moment or our bi-level lapse which means it automatically revokes um the by-law changes that we're proposing here are likely to be um fully completed before december this year so they'll be on a much faster track once the national changes are finalized there'll be an implementation process um there might be regulations that's under it for example so that will push the dates out even further and there's strong support for this by-law so we don't want to risk not having a bylaw while we're in a place of legislative uncertainty so we need to be clear about that in our a small amendment to that referenced and the additional recommendations which are in the supplementary memo which was circulated the time frames for the council to make a submission on the national consultation are also quite tight so there's a recommendation to delegate the finalization of that submission to the chair of the committee and members that want to be involved yeah thank you very much and I think if can we see all of those recommendations up there um so the additional recommendations and I think that's put um councillors turner and daniels on as well as me so if people are okay with that seem to be this morning okay and number 10 there has changed um to that have gone in with the original one is that right yeah from the very top because otherwise they were repeating themselves no other changes from the ones in the memo though no okay any questions yeah yeah yeah so any questions first yanni thank you thank you for the work that you've done on this um under the um page 28 uh paragraph three north beach the number of freedom campers and 37 has reduced from high levels um but you still saying this still steady number of campers in the area I despite the lack of international travelers I guess what I was trying to understand is what sort of um uh what are we seeing in regards to people who actually need housing like is this sort of people that are homeless or transient or living in cars versus I guess the perception of you know young people coming from overseas or around new zealand freedom keeping so there's a mix of definitions there one is that because we put a temporary closure on that car park sort of over the last year that has meant that we've seen a reduction in people camping there so that's been working quite well um the the the range of campers that are in that area um is varied um there are absolutely some people who are genuinely homeless in there and some um frequent freedom campers um the homelessness um is not treated in the same way as freedom camping and so we of their vehicle we take a different approach to that um which is um more sort of wrap around service and engaging with them and trying to see what we can do to support and encourage them to meet a more secure housing situation um so that the issues are quite separate in terms of how we would enforce the limitations in the bible so do we do we have a sense of the percentage of those that are freedom campaign for you know for leisure recreation versus um people that need somewhere to stay the night all that data is available from the monitoring enforcement that's been done over the summer I don't have it with me at the moment but I can I can find out from the enhancement team thanks tess any further questions no in that case do I have a mover for the staff recommendations this is yup tim thank you and um phil for seconding do I have any debate um tim you know first of all thank you very much for this and it is a hell of a lot of and this has been a particularly hot potato there's no question about it just just want to remind people that they are in a covert situation so the pressure is off a bit so which we're kind of been taking a breath for a while but the two areas that are mentioned richard naval point and north beach which have been problem areas without question there are other areas around christchurch which were added to when those were put in so just we're not out of the park yet and um there are going to be some issues in the future but I do commend the staff for what they do and also our regulatory staff who go there and try and make the assessment between homeless and freedom camping because there is a very big difference to that so thank you cheers thank you andrew thank you um yeah I would agree that the current bylaw is working well but equally I would agree that um there is a continued need for a bylaw um I'm certainly pleased to see the um changes to the in this chamber before about the need for some changes to the act and the national situation and some consistency and the proposals that government have put forward pick up some of the discussions and recommendations of the local and central government working parting of which I've been a part since its inception so I'm pleased to see some of that work finally being picked up as stated in the memo which is in the agenda the proposed changes from government don't affect our need to review the bylaw and I'm pleased that we are in a position where we can continue to do that anyway um I i welcome the review I welcome the proposal and the changes that are proposed within it and thanks staff for what I know has been a significant amount of work to get this to the point where we can consider it today um reflecting some of tim's comments I am aware of some concerns and some issues in different parts of the city some of them certainly are picked up in the proposed changes in the um in front of us um I regularly get comment from people in the community about freedom camping issues or things that people are not happy about or would suggest improvements to and of course in various different parts of the city they manifest themselves differently consulting on this draft bylaw is the opportunity for people to have their say on that and to make those comments in a more formal sense and I know there are some people out there who have got comments who are waiting for this opportunity who certainly will be providing that feedback at that time so I would encourage those people and others to take that opportunity to provide their views on this proposal um and certainly I welcome that consultation feedback so fully supportive of this today thank you for the debate no in that case I'll put this all those people please say aye those against declare that carried thank you very much
That's carried thank you now moving to item nine the corporate finance report and we've got bruce for this one bruce welcome to the table um we'll take the reporters read are there any um introductory remarks that you'd like to make yes good morning councillors there's nothing nothing significant to see in this report in terms of treasury um all positions are within policy limits we've got 132 million dollars due for repayment next month which we've already pre-funded in september october so we have the funds on hand to do that in terms of general debt there was an increase but it was largely due to billing the crown for the next installment of the multi-use arena which was paid has been paid in april in terms of rates death there's been a continuing decline in rate debt down to 19.7 million at the moment two million of that is prior year's arrears the balance of 17.7 is current year's arrears so that's trending in the right direction as well that's about all I've got them yep all good um thank you for that are there any questions on this report all right so I'm so sam you're happy to move do we have a seconder okay jimmy all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you um and bruce staying with you for
And so the last thing that I'm going to do before we adjourn for uh lunch is to move that the public be excluded for the um items on the agenda there is no one that needs to be included is there no no and the agenda sets out the reasons for I'll move that secondary by pauline cotter any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried we will oh and opposed as yani and um we will now attune for lunch and we'll be back here at 2pm thank you
So item eight the capital projects performance report ruth welcome to the table thank you um and again if we can take any headline or introductory comments before we move to questions um and again noting that you've got um heads of service available you've got appropriate managers available to be um talking to their areas and also answer any questions on their particular areas as well cool thank you good morning everyone uh so the report in front of you status is at march uh this year there is an update on the slide in front of you also available on the hub that shows our april status just bearing in mind that all april actuals are not yet in so focusing on our core program up there on the left hand side on the top left olive council we are forecasting a delivery of 358.4 against the 376.8 that would give us a result of 95 spend against budget or a carry forward of 18.4 million so you can see also the breakdown by our key delivery units also to indicate what they are forecasting to at the bottom left there parakiori and cmua as you know these are delivered by third parties uh the forecasts that we receive uh are reflected directly in our system from them so we have no influence on those forecasts uh spin to date so an update on the march spend because at the time of writing within the report it noted that spend was at 94 delivery units achieved 97 to the end of march and as of today with april not yet closing delivery units have spent 82 of their forecasted spend so that would bring us a total spend to date of 306 across all of capital or 2.8.9 against the core program so in our final months just a reminder that june is a double month of spend so we accrue all june costs within june so that they're captured in the financial year that the work has been completed so that means we have three months of spend remaining so we have 109 million dollars forecast for spend left on our core program so I'll be asking the delivery units to come up for your reference and the papers that you have refer to pages 44 and 46 showing the breakdown of each month they'll be speaking to that and you'll also note that in those slides this month you can see the change from their previous month forecast so firstly transport so they're forecasting a remaining spend of 43 million and last year they spent 37 million in may and june sorry lynette can talk today you have a blessing I have a voice this month thank you good morning everyone um so as as last month we have a number of um large con large projects under contract and under construction there's a number of cycleway contracts out there um on south express norway's dark heath get um not heathcote rapanui three that are underway in working we are looking to get a couple of small bits of northern line off the key rail corridor started so they're being they're being worked on at the moment as well there is more um that has been contracted kashmir hoon haye wesley's has been tended morning about coastal pathway so there's a lot more work under contract than we were in the same position last year so that's why we have the confidence to spend next three waters so they're forecasting a remaining spend of 52 million last financial year three waters spent 30 million in may in june let's tell it hello everyone my name is talat last year we were forecasting and achieved less because our curve was front loaded and we had lots of construction projects which were tapering down from last year but this time we have done all the hard work and we have done all the procurements and the projects are coming into construction every week every month so that's why we are forecasting more 52 million in in the last months and most of them are from the regulation projects big big reticulation project which are 35 in numbers and in next month they all will be in construction so it's a easy spend which will come from the contractor's progress payments cool thank you I have any particular question I together at the end but thank you and finally darren with community forecasting a spend of five million uh last year they also spent five million um I've got to shift five million in the next three months um imminently achievable it's a portfolio of 143 projects from the ground up that's that's the community portfolio um the five million dollars aggregates around about half a dozen projects um final accounts on sonoran's community centre the edmond band rotunda um we're doing a million dollars worth of hard surface paving in the botanic gardens at the moment that'll be cleared by the end of the financial year and some significant work at the pioneer pool so I can see where the money's going to come and with the reforecasts there um imminently achievable and the time to run thank you thanks and then finally major facilities we don't have aleister in the room at the moment it's behind you right here thank you hi alastair welcome clearly your timing is perfect so 31.4 million forecasts for the next few months with regard to metro sports facility itself and also the cmua and metro sports is forecasting some we're based the forecast is based on their productivity and we've we are presented the figures and we input the figures according to the uh project delivery um team being cpp and otakuro and we know that there are some substantial sums to be met um and they're looking highly unlikely that they'll meet those uh with the june figure being 10.4 million at the moment uh which is an unknown really in the christchurch market but uh we'll see if they get there eventually um the second part would be cmua and we all know that cmua b6 watpack have been appointed with them being appointed we're now starting to see a forecast come from them and we've started geotech work and we're and we're deep into the design teams at the moment and we're expecting the first invoice which will be around about 2.5 million so we're starting to see the forecast come to light and the spend profile being for the next 12 months so confident with that cool um I'll just call out a couple more things um and then go to questions so uh the watch list report page 62. uh our charm street brick barrel project had practical completion in april there's just some final resurfacing works to be completed this week and then the external funded report page 65 our northwest arc cycle routes section 1a 1b and 1c are also now complete I'll take any questions potentially with the major facilities I'd recommend that any specific questions relating to those portfolios be taken later in the agenda we've got the uh update from alistair later on great thank you so ready to take questions now pauline thanks ruth just on page 42 when we talk about the three waters and there's actual savings there of 10 million because of um oh what does it say oh just beautiful competitive low prices confirming tenders now underneath that it looks at um purchasing land for stormwater activity and future proofing that is that intended to come out of the 10 leaving us with a real surplus yeah the latter so the land purchase is already part of the forecast so three waters are currently looking for opportunities to accelerate projects to bring them back to fill in that 9.4 million great that's good news thank you can I comment on that um yeah certainly so unusually you'll hear me say this um pauline is that for once it's a good thing that we have nine million because actually we're getting sharper prices and that's a good thing to means we can be recycling the money into elsewhere thank you jimmy fuel purchase from overseas the total country extension whether will impact those delivery in may of 2022 so yes it's all green hello it's all green it's all going for may 22._``_591.92 we receive already received what's material material purchase material from australia we're not we're not purchasing that material carry roll or purchasing that material but we are looking to go to uh tinder soon as my understanding so holswell junction road extension is showing is it's material purchase from the overseas to australia to from italy a period of time I just want to know update status our project manager is working with kiwi rail to understand that and is reporting in this report that things are on track to do to meet the requirements and to make these time frames okay second is the page 63 what update status multicultural recreation and the community center this one there's a green this green but I'm not sure whether I have any other progress or not there's uh so what was the question jimmy sorry no question update status yeah so it's the the progress at the moment is it sits with the governor's team at the moment because they're still working through and negotiating the next steps if you will so we've been we were allocated the project to look at what we could do um across with the property itself and then what we could do across the portfolio and see where we could slot changes needing to be made into the play that's now gone back steps from a governor's perspective so that's the update that I can give you the money's still in play we're just not spending any of that money at all at the moment yeah but in here you know your signal is still green in my my my view is a little bit uncertain it should be there there's no uncertainty it's no uncertainty it's about consultation that's all so it's just the next steps we're just going through a process john's leading that process and I'll get john to give you an update okay okay last question okay on page the 67 the crown regeneration acceleration fund craf for 40 million dollars I'm not sure except these five projects you know total investigate for 10 million have any the projects in relation to the southwest area particular holes were in the holmby area because those are trafficking you know transition is quite quite serious I'm not sure whether I have any other project in relation to so the craft the craft money yeah yeah regeneration the there's five geographic areas and money for safety projects and pt projects the geographic areas um there's a hallswool no there's a rickard and rickard and geographic area that is covered with the works and that's that's underway as per everything we've discussed previously yeah but but my concept but how about the horse when the homie area knows the traffic boy this has all been a great this has all been agreed previously so there were previous decisions of council which determined the priority areas so staff are obviously then working on projects within the areas that we previously that we previously as governors decided would be the priority areas and then was put into the business case which is submitted to central government which is what they have signed off and therefore we need to deliver in the areas that have been agreed absolutely okay thank you thank you thank you any further questions yeah um thank you just just on page 60 um right at the top we've got the naval point development plan where they said the original delivery't know if that's a typo or um and then it's got the approved delivery date january 2027 but given that we've got the sale gp and we've made a sort of commitment to do stuff is that does that need to be updated or have a separate um section just so we can have confidence that the facilities will be ready in time the um the adopted master plan is envisaged to be delivered over that period of time over that 10-year time frame or thereabouts the piece of work we're doing now the carve out to create the car park to allow the sail gp event to take place is moving at pace um and we'll have that complete by christmas um the date for the total project completion I think sounds about right six to seven years out what was that 20 27 27 27. look I'll have a look at that for next time but it's certainly um that that's the way the money is sequenced in the ltp that we'll be delivering um components of so remembering this is by exception clearly it's important that uh it's I think it's right that you could just comment on the critical piece in relation to what needs to be done this year and if there is and we ask that that be done but that only be done if there is an exception issue that isn't being delivered if it's green and it's fine then it will be silent on it because that's the point my understanding from the last briefing we had there was an exceptional issue that we needed to think about well that's not coming through in this report so there you are that's the officer telling you we have we have budget and the ltp proposed to be able to deliver upon that master plan so that's what we work towards the the ltp bid based on qs costings and able to deliver everything that came through for approval in the naval point development plan um is currently proposed within the tenure ltp at 27 million I think was the number right okay we deliver in this first year specifically to the agreement that we have yeah like so my understanding was we came back and did some sort of substitution to find the additional funding that was required um that there were different options of things that we we could do different choices that we had based on the requirements and more work had been going into detail design I might let andrew talk to that as it's deadline that needed to be met and there were some early numbers that were put in front of council uh subsequent to that we came back with some more detailed numbers and there was an increase in budget required to deliver the component that you're talking about yeah and at that time we discussed options on how we could slide money effectively to end up with the same net balance for the ltp and have no impact on the ltp across other projects so that that position hasn't changed right and as darren has pointed out yes there's lots going on in terms of negotiating how to move the project to report at this point in time okay um and I think the other thing I mean obviously we're keen to get the work done that needs to be done as a minimum but I think we also gave direction if there was opportunities to do more in a shorter time frame that that we would do we would look if you're referring to um in regard to the cell gp event yeah I mean just having this simply won't be you won't have time to add elements that are not critical to that event but we're absolutely looking at efficiencies in terms of you know we're opening up the ground if it needs to go in now to support the long term that's happening great okay um just the other question I had was in regards to the um uh the cycleway project um sorry I'm just trying to find the page um it's listed as reddit it's the tannery two martindales um sorry the page 64. um so just just trying to quite kind of understand um but when are we likely to see the detailed design I know we've lodged the consent have we got the consent approved or um what's kind of happening there we don't need consent for all of it right we need to consent for parts of it some of the consents are in and some of the approvals for working in um for easements and others are in so some of the work can go ahead others it's it's all being worked in parallel um it is still showing a I haven't got it on my root score on the list it is still showing and overspend um the team and the construction crews are working to pull that back as much as they can it was higher than that a couple of months ago so we are still working on that before we come back and report back to you and ask to utilize the contingency that is the program level contingency that is sitting there so trying to do everything they can to pull that back and be more certainty on their costs do we know what the changes are that kiwi roll have required is that typical to all the other crossings as well uh yeah yeah it is around gates usually okay um let's use your own um pedestrian gates for the crossings right and um just end signals the final question on that project that says the cost associated with cumulatives being two-way um has that decision been made well effectively the decision there is still a report that has to come back to the community board but effectively the decision was made you were asked to go out we were asked to go out and reconsult the clarity on that reconsultation has shown to stick with the original decision from to keep it two-way all right okay so but we're going to get a report back with that it won't be decision report be an information report yes okay all right thank you are there any further questions on this report mike thank you just one thing uh two parts to it um it's good to see that the um level crossings roll cross ends in this I assume that's still 22. yes and that's obviously the full upgrade yeah sorry at the end of all of them yeah do we have a time frame for the interim solution um obviously that's quite a busy road of the moment I mean I've been digging for that yesterday I couldn't get that information so I'll have to come back to you on that one okay probably thank you any further questions so I'm I'm happy to move the receipt of this report do I have a second sam mcdonald um all those in is there any debate all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you
On to the mayor's monthly report um it's unlike usual it actually has a couple of additional um recommendations with it this month um it has the uh a a um a request for an endorsement for the nomination of principal advisor community partnerships and planning um claire phillips to the royal commission inquiry implementation oversight advisory group which is advisory group to the government and also adopting the resolution just it's a shareholders resolution required for the um v based name change to venues otto tahi in my report I've done what I've what I always do which is highlight some of the features of the month but because it was the month of march it was in the that was um it's in retrospect um I won't go over any of those details I have used the the v based change of name though to highlight uh the um the the major change that they have made to shift to local products so catering is all in-house now venus ototahi now sources 71 of all food and beverage product from the 29 of products are sourced from the rest of the south island seven percent from the north island um 16 and only six percent of products are now from overseas previously 30 of all products were from overseas so it's an incredible um turnaround so in real terms this means 40 local suppliers to our local venues most of whom are new in the in the last year so it is a great turnaround so I'm really impressed with that and the one other thing that I'll draw your attention to is a fantastic launch that I went to uh the other night um in common and that directly arises out of the events of the 15th of march 2019 and as you know the royal commission has asked us to think deeply about what creates social cohesion and there's a group of people and claire's been amongst them have worked on a right across agencies right across communities to develop this tool called in common and it encourages christchurch residents to reach out across cultures and faiths to make canterbury a better place where on to the website you'll see some lovely little stories with images of people you can see some of them in the and what I've presented here today but but actually when they get together it's what they have in common that is the conversation starter and uh it's a it's a great um tool really for um developing those conversations so I I've got the website there for you please feel free to spread it far and wide because it's a it's just a great opportunity for us to to do something about um you know valuing our differences which make us unique but valuing all that we have in common as well so um so I'm happy to move my uh report plus the additional recommendations and does you're happy to second it jimmy chen questions or debate comments yep I kind of it just um sort of say thanks for taking the time to write really full reports on your mural activities I know that um you're probably the first mayor to do this kind and highlights a wide range of things that are often unseen by us or by others and there's a huge number of additional events and things that you go to on the city's behalf so just want to say thanks wasn't expecting aaron oops yeah I endorse um sarah's words there um because yeah you do do a lot of work and um you're also very well read you read a lot of stuff um a bit nerdy but um it's one of those things you said you like reading it um I just want to bring up or add to point three up there it was your suggestion that you put nominate clear and the entire table when we had that briefing um supported that and we're just almost overwhelmed that that was the person that you put forward and chose there's an incredible amount of respect around this table for claire and the work she does in our community and she is one of the young unsung heroes of this city that has taken this city through one of its for saying that uh jimmy yeah based on mayor's report I think the paragraph three is very very important I mean the kind of strong signal all council particular criteria city council you know we would like to in response to the royal commission's their inquiry the report and the 44 recommendations and the clear fairies over the last possibly at least 20 years not only in council but in the msd summer area she has lots of working experience and also engage wider communities what we in those name you know is I think there is a greater benefit to our council regarding to the the advice groups their particular emphasis you know still would like to embrace all kinds of the the people you know can be the joint together in order to in response to help the government for the implementation government implementation and the plan etc it's not a crude only one person just want everybody know the other one is particularly riverside market you know they they done the greater job because while they particularly in their the level of specific area they might have a function event you know activity in there I i myself I attend those function events for even over the last months three three three times you know like irania the new year uh japanese one and also the uh the income et cetera now they done a great job so I think possibly you know it was some uh coming community a business down the great job I suggest when the council consider you know presenting in the kind of certificate appreciation they say so just encouraging you know that's very very crucial because what we always emphasize this city is a diversified inclusive the the the harmonious city but they want to you know fully the into the parties compliant totally with the council the community outcome resilient community that's fantastic so let's go the patent is my view thank you so I could tell the oh sorry I was going to close the um the debate I was just going to add that clear is a fantastic choice for this role because of her knowledge and experience in the muslim community and she knows what's important to those people and so I think it's a wonderful recommendation and very just going to supportive off because I just noticed who hadn't actually read the report when jimmy started talking about the riverside market so on page 20 I refer to the fact that over the last year riverside market has supported community events as part of the cultures of otatahi series and they have been hosting these events I've been to most of them I think jimmy's been to all of them and his idea of actually recognising the riverside market um that they actually did receive a presentation in common um for the launch of uncommon there the other night um but I think we should we too should so I'll take that as an action and bring that back in the next report because I think we should honour them for what they've done and um and uh I was going to say too that claire's nomination was supported from members of the muslim community of brief families so I just wanted for her so thank you very much for the comments that you've made and they will be passed on to her so I will put the motions all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you and now we will return um to the fixed question of the draft
So then moving to item seven the performance exceptions report now um peter I'll get you to make some introductory remarks in just a moment but first to say that um this is the first time that we've seen this report updated um with the recent results from the resident satisfaction survey and the point of contact survey now both of those surveys are going to be reported in a formal sense to counsel at the council meeting on the 13th of may that will be the opportunity for any detailed questions on those surveys the survey methodology the survey results and any of the trends and so on that those are showing so anything that specifically about the surveys or the survey results those questions would be rightly directed to that meeting the 13th of may however today would be the appropriate time to raise any questions around performance exceptions including those that have been updated by the survey results but anything about the survey specifically um we'll be referring to the council meeting on the 13th of may when the report on those surveys comes to the table and I'd welcome any introductory remarks that you've got on this report and thank you and good morning just to clarify the purpose of this report again it's to report high-level results against performance goals the more detailed analysis follows in the finance and project management reports the top line of service delivery is that it's stable it has been since basically october last year we're sitting at about 82 and a half percent of levels of service successfully delivered out of looking for about 85. now the show is not over that's only a couple uh that could take us to to success and there are some that are hanging in the balance so we may end up at 85 yet these results as the chair has noted contain the resident survey results across a whole raft of levels of service the bottom line of that is that those that went the wrong way are netted off by those that went the right way and there's been a negligible effect overall on the overall result um obviously every year decline there's a certain percentage where there's an increase and basically they net out this year um it's also worth noting that there are some levels of service that are affected still affected by covert obviously attendance and visits at things like the art gallery are going to be affected by the lack of international visitors so the positive there is you may note if you look at previous years the volatility involved the forecasting this year is spot on the managers are really on top of what they're doing they have their forecasts have proven to be very very accurate to the point where even the resident survey which is a somewhat subjective feedback from the public their forecasts have been accurate there as well so it's good to see that we're we've got a tight reliable forecast to put in front of you non-ltp levels of service which are more detailed and management oriented are actually quite a lot higher than this so that's just a piece of context moving on to the watchlist capital projects uh you'll get uh 80 for a target of 90 on major watch lists uh watch us projects um bearing in mind that that's a view of the watch list based on whole of life not just the current year you'll get details of specific exceptions and project exceptions in ruth's report to follow the highlights are pointed out there and any changes from the original baseline in the ltp so for both in short for both watch list projects and levels of service we're running close to target we still have almost a quarter of a year left so it's hard to predict exactly where it will end but this will be reasonably close to where it will end following that there are some uh management comments on levels of service exceptions um supplying actuals remedial actions and any commentary the the quality of those comments we're working on with the managers to make sure you get the right information in front of you there are very few surprises in there they're consistent with previous months if there are questions on any of those I them if they're present or we can if they're detailed questions we can take them away and report back to you uh which is a protocol set up in previous meetings thank you and I mean it's interesting what causes a project to go red we've got saint albans community center um pushed back by 12 days in the grand scheme of things minimal but that causes that to be shown as an exception so I mean that's just one example of how a very small change can result in something showing up in this report yes all right so um peter thanks for the introduction um happy to take any questions on this other other questions on this report no questions all right in which case I'm happy to move that we receive the information provided in the report jimmy will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you thank you
Okay um we'll now move on to the intangible heritage grant application for teputahi architectural audio tour welcome back victoria if you could give us a quick summary then we'll move to questions thank you thank you all um this is the first of the intangible heritage grants from the new scheme that you established for us in the annual plan I've put down a recommendation that the committee support the creation of a digital architectural tour of our city by approving this grant the grant will allow t putahi to develop a free to use accessible and innovative new approach to showcasing and publicizing our heritage and an exciting and engaging way so that the stories of the buildings and the parts of the city that have got significance now and for the future can be shared as the unique tonga that they are the thirty thousand dollar grant will provide a tour on an app of ten key landmark buildings across the city some are recognized as heritage items they're in the district plan some are places like our new wonderful library isn't part of our architectural heritage and the stories that sit behind that building and why and how it was created are just as valuable to capture now for the future so it's looking at heritage as it was but also the future heritage that is to come locals and visitors will be able to access this and engage more with the heritage of the city and the stories and the diversity of those stories that are such a part of christchurch city the other thing to remember with it is that it is the first of this type of tour the applicants have also said that they will be offering it up for free to use it will be provided on a creative commons license which means that it will go to our libraries and I was talking this morning to our libraries about it it will go into the canterbury stories into our digital repository there and then it can be accessed by anybody through the library system it can be added to the information that's on the gibson wall as part of that and also as model and make their own tours so we have a group in wollstone who are looking at doing a wonderful wollstone tour they've identified places they can use this as a model or a template to gather their stories and pull them together I was at a community board meeting where there was a group looking at trying to do the same around wooden park and gather stories based on wooden park and places around there they'll also be able to take this as a model and a prototype and then build on it so this money is for these 10 items but it is also creating a wider prototype for other groups to feed into and use as a model that's great thank you very much any questions sam yeah thank you um it's a tough one because I do I like the concept I'm just trying to work out why like how many how many heritage staff would we have in it I don't know it might be a question for mary potentially but in the heritage team here at council six comms team do you think 49 about 49 yeah so why wouldn't we with a concert like this because I do like it why wouldn't we just do it in-house because I see christchurch and zeta involved as well why would we grant money when we've got teams that know about this stuff um a large portion of this is actually going to the people who will be doing the oral histories the recorded the editing the story gathering and the research gathering they'll be going out to the open open um christchurch festival and interviewing people there it's not something that sits traditionally within our role our role is to facilitate communities groups organizations to develop this kind of thing it's not something the council has ever really done themselves we've been more of a facilitator so has there been any consideration as to why we wouldn't do it I'm just thinking economies of scale because I like the concept of you know talking about doing it in woolston and the likes with different things if we've got a something in-house that makes it far more efficient far more effective than having to grant money I think we've got carolyn who might be able to give a short answer uh so open christchurch is a privately um is a privately a private initiative and um they are taputahi uh um as the christchurch centre for architecture are advancing that they are so they are arranging all of the um all of the buildings that are open all of the insurance access all of the detail around that this is one component of that that that they've decided that they want to add this to their um to their offering for their program it happened it also happens that it can have a longer life I guess that staff have approached this on the basis that the council have signaled that they want to engage the community in looking at intangible heritage fund funding to enable us to start to acknowledge and encourage community groups to look at stories and I guess further information around the city of christchurch that doesn't rely on the resources of council is not not something that um I've encouraged um to be an internal um thing I've I think that um well I've perhaps wrongly read the queue that council would like community groups to pick up such initiatives and take them forward I think that one of the things is that it's in the um the heritage strategy but carolyn I think one of the questions is from based on sam's this particular piece of work if council chose to use council resources to do it if there were available resources could we do it for a lower price I guess is what your question is yeah um given their number of volunteer hours and stuff so um having looked at the um work that he had done in other I guess in other sectors and um in some of the um the place making work they are very cost effective and I doubt I i don't think that we would necessarily be able to achieve the same outcome well that's that's very alarming that's very alarming if we can't hours as probably the moment you look at the volunteer hours no no you can't completely get that but there's a lot of costs in here that I would have thought we already have within our organization so if we can't do it for the same or if not less that's anyway sorry okay so okay any further questions all right in that case um do I have a mover for this one um melanie this time and secondary mike uh do you have any discussion jamie briefly um look the ratepayers have already paid for saving a number of key heritage buildings in the city and I don't think they need to be up for it again uh to partially fund storytelling audio for them um look the app could even be a 99 cent or a pay pay app if people have a smartphone so um look I think again you you need to make a call of where it stops so I'm not supportive of this tim um look I hope there would be some vision in the future with regards um art gallery museum and ourselves involved so you can um look at um the what gap filler have done it right the whole story of christchurch the artworks that we have etc so I think this is a start but I think we could do so much more and whether we do it and I'd take sam's point that it'd be really good to have partners and others that could pay for it and enhance the cities because I think this is a really good start to what could be sam yeah I won't be supporting it I mean the 30 30 000 grant along with the in kind from the likes of christchurch nz I think as james said you know there is a constant drain on the ratepayer for a lot of this stuff we have an organization with thousands of staff you cannot tell me there is not economies of scale by doing a lot of this stuff in-house we have experts in heritage we have a whole libraries team and a comms department if we can't facilitate a lot of we're doing a job properly so I can't support it melanie then anne um look when we looked at the heritage strategy and we then allowed for intangible heritage grants and agreed as a council that we that we would support that it would seem strange to me that we then wouldn't go and support something there's an entire intangible heritage grant for telling the stories they can be done at a you know at a very cost effective um way because we know that the way that these sorts of people work is very cost effective and they put in lots of volunteer hours and they can they will be closer to the ground um than our heritage staff because there'll be a lot of people who'll be wanting to put these stories together um so it's just a no-brainer and I don't think 30 000 is actually a lot of money in the scheme of things and we often whenever we have discussions about giving funds to heritage buildings we often talk about how we make them accessible to the is the way that we do this this is a perfect use of money to make these beautiful places and buildings accessible people can't often go into them but they can learn about them and an audio tour is a perfect way for that to happen so very supportive of this it's a great use of of resource developing something that is going to have a huge benefit to both growing awareness to our city residents but also those who are visiting the city because of the architectural and heritage values that we have here and christchurch nz and their destinations site talk about christchurch as that place so this is a way to open up that knowledge to to those visitors and to our residents so very supportive of this thank you anyone else no jimmy that's right yeah I support this one because based on the stuff like I mentioned this is the first intangible heritage grant application and we review those I have this strategy now particularly not only cover tangible but also intangible intent to actually you know is to promote our city this one the staff particularly mentioned fee for the digital world libraries etc you know and also particularly focus on the those uh kind of across the whole city you know related to arc architecture audio guide app etc I think that's very crucial for for us because we have to encourage this one this part of the history part of our the kind of story we need to promote and share with the you know the the one another I think they see put simple thank you anyone else no I'll be supporting this today I think one of the key things we do as a council is to try and encourage and enable community groups and organisations to do much of the work that some people think council should do um in the city I think that keeping this accessible for everyone in the city via not just the app but by our libraries making it accessible from a range of different sources is really important and with no cost attached I think that if we were to start asking the organisation to pick up the all the time then what we would be doing in the end would be asking our park staff to run our community gardens and we'd be asking every time someone came up with a new idea for a new environmental app we'd be saying oh listen surely our staff could do that because we've got great staff in i.t and comms I think that enabling our community groups and our residents groups to pick up this to make the most of the community building that happens at the same time to make the most of the volunteer time that's involved is a really good for the city not just for heritage but for a range of other things as well so that's why I'm happy to support this today and with that I'll put the motion all those in favor please say aye those against those recorded declare that carried so um councillors mcdonald goff and chu and kewan against thank you very much that's carried right and we'll take a 15 minute break and come back at 20 past
That's carried so then moving to item four public forum um no public forum items today item five deputations no deputations today item six presentation of petitions no petitions today so then moving to item seven the performance exceptions report now um peter I'll get you to make some introductory remarks in just a moment but first to say that this is the first time that we've seen this report
Now we move to public forum so first up today we have andrew and cleve who are coming to talk to us about the big street bikers project and the locky docks so welcome um got five minutes and if you press the button and the thing yeah and then just just press that so it turns green yep and they're shared so you don't need to press them again till the end awesome kyoto uh thank you for having us again we were here um in 2019 I believe and we um came to introduce what we were planning to do with the lockheed docks and now we're coming to say this is uh what has happened and uh tell you the success that we've experienced um with this prototype which is leading the nation uh in terms of um electric mobility and sustainable transport um and so yeah we'll just take sure we've um there's some research that uh waka katahi has done to support this and from our own findings as well uh just to remind you so our vision mercury around the country to do this and um currently installing sites in other cities now so we've made it free to the public and free to property owners to use this infrastructure for secure parking this is robbie henderson here who we're introduced to by vicky buck when we presented last year or the year before rob installed the network here in christchurch and now subsequently installing uh lockheed docks all around the country so and his team of contractors and planning people as well so it's creating business for people here what the lockey docks do is create awareness for the safe bike paths and safe routes provide secure parking and free charging so um one of the key aspects of it is that so that on the digital screens they have maps on there that we co-designed with uh the city council uh biking team and with waka katahi um we the wakate did some research on it and I found that people found them very useful uh which we we think is really a really important thing um in terms of removing the are safe ways to get around their bike paths and other safe um back streets to take um so really important part of the equation we're changing out the headlines to prompt more people who drive to take up biking so it's all keeping it really upbeat so every time someone locks a bike we have a data point on that so we know how many bikes have been parked they started pretty quietly and during last year when we installed the network um but things have been ramping up over the last six months um people every um as you see 92 percent of people find it really easy to use I've had um uh 2869 bikes parked since then and zero thefts um and this is an image of most of the locky docks around now you're seeing them quite full and requests for a lot of extra sites um really strong trend developing and this is the where it's getting really interesting so we're seeing an 18 increase of bike parks bikes packed month on month so on that trajectory uh we reach capacity with the current locker docks um and then so you just see there for the month of march that was 766 bikes park that's that's that many less cars on the road so it's doing a very direct job in terms of reducing emissions uh measurable job so this is another interesting pattern that uh so we see so here you see as the time of day that people are parking so we see that these are actually commuters so as an example this is one locky dock on turm street so we see that these people are parking at eight am in the morning so we know that they're coming in to park for the day for work and so that's a really encouraging pattern so that means that some less congestion less than less emissions so impact formula from this is um so this is what we're beginning to model um so we can see um so on the left hand side it's all about increasing uh feeling of safety through knowing the safe bike routes through knowing convenient to use and it's normal because it's highly visible it makes it look like it's a it's a cool thing to do to ride a bike so the outcomes being reducing emissions reducing congestion and improving mental health physical health resilience in the community um helping retailers and so on so the really really measurable um outcomes and so we're starting to put numbers to all those outcomes now um and so that'll be the next report which more detailed um a big upshot so as soon as there was an after we announced launching it in christchurch we had um literally um property owners from queenstown driving up to christchurch and saying can we get some down here we had napier city council have written their own licensed occupy agreement for us to put lockey docks into napier uh palmerston north new plymouth taupo taranga hamilton auckland we're currently installing in auckland wellington at the moment um so it's been amazing demand all off the back of the initiative in christchurch so it started here first I want you to the government is um hugely supportive of this so you see um um minister of energy megan woods there and minister of transport michael wood when we uh announced our rollout plans nationwide in wellington last year both of them came out on the night to speak and and even wakita has offered us a site on welles street in wellington as a model for more sites publicly owned sites across the country uh here's a list of all the people who places where they want to have more locky docks than christchurch um so yeah yeah there's more and more um so just as a reminder so it's a self-funded public infrastructure model so it's free to the public and to the property owner and it's made possible through um content partners and sponsors and so this is where it's uh community engagement comes you know the likes from the council um from christchurch nz from other local businesses and brands like mercury that helped make this happen I'm getting all the signals to say hurrah thank you very much so this up that was the launch day last june um and I know that the bakery in rangiora is um getting rave reviews for having the lofty docks out there I don't know when they went in but um yeah yeah just uh just about a month ago right getting good reviews online which is good so thank you very much for coming in and giving us an update on those um really good to see and I'm sure we'll see more of them around thank you absolutely right and now we have um uh professor chris kizling and mr trevor lord from the mclean's mansion charitable trust thank you for coming in today and giving us an update good morning and thank you for this opportunity um to talk to you about mclean's mansion and what progress we've been making there and in five minutes that's pretty short time long gallop um our update to you today really is to convey our priorities trustees and how we are managing to affect considerable progress on the mansion within budget which remains valid and and your heritage unit has commended and improved the approach that we have taken in spending that very significant landmark heritage grant that came through this council without a doubt I think if that grant had not been made the mansion would have not have survived so we're very grateful so we're here today really to account to you on that progress chris and commencing the update I just wanted to begin by showing you the the photograph at the top and I think that says an awful lot about this impressive massive uh building of real big stature internationally that we're dealing with on the city's behalf by way of a perspective to open and it's very important this we're going to look at the heritage and cultural value of the mansion because this really underpins why we're bothering and why this is worth so much it's one of the world's largest victorian timber mansions it was built in a jacobian style in the manner of a major english country house and in fact one built for the rothschild family rare in christchurch and sparing no expense interestingly it was the vision of mr alan mclean a very successful canterbury run holder and the important part here is that the house and fortune were actually destined for the care of woman in need not just a house it was very much this vision it was a major statement and remains so even now for women's welfare internationally the mclean institute which he formed is arguably new zealand's first true social welfare model conceived in about 1898 and it's still operating and they're very keen to return to the mention some excitement there it's internationally unique and the main thing is it's right here in the christchurch cbd introducing the project we first spoke to the committee in mid-2016 we outlined then our vision and purpose which was to restore and preserve the mansion it was a multi as a multi-faceted attraction for the city and community with paid entry at the time we're going to look at education and art music canterbury history etc and even include an art gallery a grant of came from the central city landmark heritage grant fund and we believe with gratitude it was and remains the largest heritage grant ever awarded by the city so the mention was purchased or the agreement to purchase was a little bit later in august 2018 and in january 2019 the heritage covenant aspect of that purchase was resolved with the mortgagor and work started continuing uh into looking at progress at this slide gives you some idea of what's been going on to restore this building required the foundations to be remediated um that has been done with some quite clever engineering it's done um the building is now level um and the internal strengthening uh can continue and the net result of all that is that this building will well exceed the national code national building standards on the slide that you've got in front of you it gives you some of that sort of detail we've only got one minute left apparently so we'll push on updating the intended purpose we're now we're an educational charitable trustworthy wide scope the business us in our free public access simpler and more sustainable model for the trust to administer and it provides a means to continue the building preservation from income the present model still holds as fundamental principles things like education and activities and arts music heritage and cultural significance of the mansion as a vibrant and vital community asset when few such options that still exist in the cbd is an internationally iconic presence for tenants we are currently negotiating with the christchurch school of music and the mclean institute as I mentioned before as major users that could see things like 1200 students 40 practice rooms on saturday and so on with some funding required and it preserves the mansion's original and intended community purpose and social roles really to conclude anyone who doubted that this significant heritage building could not be restored and made available for future violent use can put those doubts aside there is however no hiding the fact that as a trust we are facing a big hurdle to pay out the murray family their interest-free three-year mortgage that they have on the land we to get to that point from any source whatsoever I'll leave it at that thank you very much and I'm sorry you do have you have reached the end of your time there um but thank you for the update and people have had a chance to read the whole presentation already and so um there may be further communication I guess between us in the future thank you very much
Has carried and then we've got two supplementary reports um that we need to include in today's agenda so item 19 the resolution to include the supplementary reports in the meeting um I'm happy to move that we do so jake mcclellan will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried so then moving to item four public forum no public forum items today item five deputations
Uh plane change eight the papakaiana kinda zone rule amendments notification uh thank you I'll get you just to give a brief overview of this paper okay so this is a uh report for notification of a plan changes that we're proposing uh and we've been working with um mahanui curator brad thompson here from their organisation um and we work closely with the the uh across the front the bank's peninsula on this so this is a plan change to really enable more public housing in the um across the peninsula um and to remove some of the impediments to house housing development there around certainly around setbacks and earthworks and some of the um some some of the the the site coverage um provisions as well which has prevented um some houses being built we've had a lot of engagement with roona there's been done um hui with the with the renault across peninsula and we've also presented this to the committee as well so yeah happy to take any questions any questions I know someone wants to aaron over sarah like to thank and acknowledge staff for what I know is a huge amount of work that's gone into um this um yeah this work and um I think this really shows the value of the good relationships that we've developed with um local runanga and particularly the value of the te hong papa tipa running committee as well where there's been some very positive discussion about this and where there's been the opportunity for answers and concerns to be raised and questions asked and answered the changes that were made to the peppa king zones in the district plan review as we've seen from various presentations and work that's been presented as this has been developed in many cases even though the intention was good or unworkable and this plan change actually gives effects to if it's implemented and gives effect to the changes that were made in um the district plan review so that they are able to be implemented and so that we can realistically look at these um zones been developed alongside the wishes of the runanga realizing this obviously need to be dealt with as a separate matter and I'm also aware that some work going on alongside the um development contributions policy proposal um which will look at a realistic proposition to allow development in the papakainga zones from a development contributions point of view as well so I absolutely welcome this um I think it's a great piece of work and I look forward to seeing it progress thank you anyone else I'll put that all those in favor post carried I'm just going to

Thank you uh we're we're actually going to go to item 18 so that we can um address the naming of the metro sports facility and that is because uh we have lynn who's joined us here today to support the mata potpourri representation on the on the gifting of the name so that's very much appreciate appreciated so thank you lynn for being here as well so I'll hand over to you and um craig hutchings I'm the facility establishment manager at council and I'm joined by um lynn thiaker who's representing mata poppery the purpose of this report for council is to consider a permanent name for metro sports facility which is currently the working title for the new recreation and sports facilities being constructed between morehouse road and antigua street while the report contains all the background information regarding the name and the rationale for the recommendation I would just like to take a moment to reinforce the link between the special name that local renault and taina tahriri have gifted as the largest recreation and sports facility in for all cantabrians support pathways for high performance athletes and importantly increase participation rates in sport and recreation the story of parikhiori the gift and name which I will shortly pass over to lynn to talk about will provide a means of inspiration the use of recreation and sport as descriptors are important as they communicate the purpose of the facility recreation being activities done for enjoyment and not outside of work sport being activities being involved in physical exertion and skill in which people usually compete against each other these words together parakuriori recreation and sports center will provide meaning build a sense of pride in cultural identity and inspire the millions of customers that will visit the facility when it opens and I think an important part of that is the education of the the name so I'll pass over to lynn and we'll actually start that process and and lynn will we'll we'll take you through some of that story uh everyone I'm here as a face of matapurpuri but also from aitua and I'm a trustee of the marae and upo called te maideto who's actually on the mutton bird islands at the moment seasonal food gathering but he was the one who actually came up with the name and I'll just walk you through the powerpoint presentation I understand you have a copy but we'll go through it so the metro sports facility promotes sporting excellence in physical wellness from a maori perspective it also links to physical strength and agility and these are all part of the core narrative thread of wellbeing traditional maori existence demanded high physical ability of men and women alike to survive the transient subsistence way of life within the southern landscape and to survive as warriors physical and mental excellence is celebrated through the many traditional narratives that tell of the relationship between maori and the environment and independent interdependence of both for continued health and wellbeing one such narrative from ahuriri tells the story of resilience determination and agility it is summarised in its simplest form in the following slides tu dakotahi was the founding chief of kaiapoipa fungituahuderi in the north canterbury area in the 1700s so he foot in the south island one of his sons was named parakiori and he was known for his prayers his agility and quick thinking he was embroiled in a battle on the moiraki beach the invaders were close by parakiori and his wife were chased along the moyaki beach where their pursuers caught up with them they taunted him about his supposed fleetness of foot and how easy he had been to catch parakiyori was not concerned and replied with a cryptic remark when the tide recedes the taurier the oyster catcher will strike the flecks of hanuka kai boone's the above pepe hall for katoki was recited by parakiyori it was a boast that they were never going to catch him because he was too fast for him the problem from parakiyori tells us that his speed was the same as again as a spark igniting dried flecks maori would use dried flecks as a fire starter and like the toria the oyster catcher if pari para kiori had moved too soon he would have been slowed down by the surf and the tide washing onto the sand landscape too to survive well in in the landscape he then promptly lifted his wife onto his back and piggybacked her down the beach so quickly that he still outran his pursuers so this is story of endurance agility and speed para kyori is a legend a hero of the 18th century and his proverb has been handed down from generation to generation the story of parakiyori also tells the significance of understanding and understanding the environment we live in and our interdependence on the flora and fauna by becoming eco-literate about learning to read our environment visually and the physical landmarks and iconic features within our environment gives gifts this name for the metro sports facility kyoda any questions I think thank you very much for the presentation because it really does um provide a sort of a compelling story uh around around the name and uh and and and the understanding of that significance of of knowing our environment um but my question is is really for for our staff member because um uh councillors um obviously had a bit of a background briefing on this and there because it has become such a feature of the of the um of the place itself it isn't a local suburban community facility it is the metropolitan center and and there was a question as to whether um particularly metro uh recreation and sports center would be an acceptable um name I just think metro from a from a branding in my my view the branding and we did as part of the document we we did consider that as an option uh at looking at um retaining that metropolitan and I understand that it is a regional based facility and all you know as opposed to our local attractions but um from a branding perspective it becomes quite difficult from a signage perspective it becomes quite difficult and I think in the the activities that are provided and the services are provided and an understanding that will attract regional and national events the understanding what the facility is actually serving as a purpose will actually be achieved through through the services and programs and activities that and events that are that are provided as opposed to having to it very long then metro sports center because then I mean parakiyori metro sports centre um actually less letters and and from the from the incredible um uh activities that it will attract like national competitions and and potentially international or trans tasman uh competitions uh which will become a regular feature of this place it's the sports activities that will will be the the standout of this facility as opposed to the recreation um um respectfully the the the facility um yes a component of of it will be about sport um but but importantly for cantabrians and the key purpose one of the key objectives is to increase sport people's participation and actually people the the attraction in terms of recreation as as explained before in things that are not competitive and are not uh do don't involve people competing against each other the hydro slides the leisure the the the leisure water the aquatic sensory area spaces the fitness spaces there are so many spaces it's unfair it's unfair because I thought that we'd we'd had a discussion about this have been a surprise so I'm just I'm just getting a sense from uh councillors if if people are generally comfortable with what's up there um uh and the alternative is the is the parakiyori I mean I think there's the acceptance of the name um the gift gratefully received um but the the word metro is what people have understood about this place it is our premium premier event center really for um for both swimming and but anyway um if there's a general feeling that um that that's not the case um I'm happy to foreshadow then um the metro sports centre if that's sure yeah because I i think that'd be far more appropriate I think that one of the things that um I mean I think that people will probably still continue in some ways to call it metro sports like they call turanga and the central library those kind of things um I think that if we add metro sports as part of the official name what we risk is people just dropping the parakiyori part be the formal name um sorry I look we did have a discussion about this the other day and yes it was an informal discussion and I i may have misunderstood the extent of people's um views I thought I was representing the view of the um of the collective but not okay tim I'm not no perna why is known by everybody as naipurna why so I just think we kind of get overthinking and start with especially the european things that whole little names like the the recreation and sports centre I mean that's so boring let's be honest but everyone knows it's metro sports but if we had parachute metro sports I mean it's just everyone knows it's symmetra's we've been talking about it for almost 10 years and we gift the name as a real treasure so I think to just keep it as simple as possible possible recreation sport everyone knows it's recreational sports so metro sports so I think the gifted name with metro sports simple aaron yeah so uh well I just had a question yeah was around the um the story that was just told in all the words that went with it will that be in the foyer in that full form uh yep so we're we're working with mata poppy at the moment to look at all the all the ways whether it be video or um signage throughout the facility so so the answer is yes and there'll be other ways to tell the story as well I can see a children's book a digital story that's that's told I can hear your voice telling it when I'm writing the box I'll let you know and and if it's if it's approved there's you know there's there's a video piece that will come out and explain the story um as part of our uh our communications plan I'm happy to move this my recommendation there's nothing okay so it's been moved by aaron seconded by sarah so is there any debate I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye saying
For this gathering we seek knowledge for understanding have purpose in all we do stand tall be strong let us show respect for one another kia ora thanks sam um and we have some apologies today we've got um early departure from the mayor deputy mayor and councillor major any other apologies not to have a mover for those sam secondary tim all those in favor please say hi that's carrie thank you very much um declarations of interest for today no no um and confirmation of previous minutes for those jamie just minor correction uh item 13 of the minutes the wire fence one I think goff davidson mcdonald and chew asked that their vote against be recorded and so if you could pop that in aidan that would be great thanks that was a heritage wifi it was a heritage wife it's like my apologies yeah so with that um amendment um so we do add in some wedding they're the minutes of the can't read that with the thing in the front now which is like those changes you've got them okay okay um so mover then jamie second up pauline um all those in favor please say aye all right in against carried thank you very much and we now we move to public forum so first up today we have andrew and cleve who are coming to talk to us about the big street bikers project and the locky docks so welcome um got five minutes and if you press the button and the thing yep and then just just press that so it turns green yep and they're shared so you don't need to press them again to the end awesome kyoto uh thank you for having us again we were here um in 2019 I believe and we um came to introduce what we were planning to do with the lockheed ox and now we're coming to say this is uh what has happened and tell you the success that we've experienced um with this prototype which is leading the nation uh in terms of electric mobility and sustainable transport um and so yeah we'll just take sure we've um there this and from our own findings as well uh just to remind you so our vision is for a happy healthy carbon free altera supported by mercury around the country to do this and um currently installing sites um in other cities now so we've made it free to the public and free to property owners to use this infrastructure for secure parking this is robbie henderson here who we're introduced to by vicky buck when we presented last year or the year before rob installed the network here in christchurch and now subsequently installing locky docks all around the country so and his team of contractors and planning people as well so it's creating business for people here what the lockey docks do is create awareness for the safe bike paths and safe routes provide secure parking and free charging so um one of the key aspects of it is that so that on the digital screens they have maps on there that we co-designed with the city council biking team and with waka katahi um did some research on it I found that people found a really important thing um in terms of removing the barriers for getting people on bikes and knowing that there are safe ways to get around their bike paths and other safe um back streets to take so really important part of the equation um we're changing out the headlines to prompt more people who drive to take up biking so it's all keeping it really upbeat um so every time someone locks a bike we have a data point on that so we know how many bikes have been parked they started pretty quietly and during last year when we installed the network um but things have been ramping up over the last six months um people every um as you see 92 of people find it really easy to use we've had um uh 2869 bikes parked since then and zero thefts um and this is an image of most of the lucky docks around now you're seeing them quite full um and requests for a lot of extra sites um really strong trend developing and this is the where it's getting really parks bikes parked month on month so on that trajectory uh we're looking to install more lockheed ox as we reach capacity with the current locker docks um and then so you just see there for the month of march that was 766 uh bikes park that's that's that many less cars on the road so it's doing a very direct job in terms of reducing emissions measurable job so this is another interesting pattern that so we see so here you see as the time of day that people are parking so we see that these are actually commuters so as an example this is one lockie dock on chum street so we see that these people are parking at eight am in the morning so we know that they're coming in to park for the day for work um and so that's a really encouraging pattern so that means that some less congestion less than less emissions uh so uh impact formula from this is um so this is what we're beginning to model um so we can see um so uh feeling of safety through knowing the safe bike routes through knowing your bike's not going to get stolen it's easy and convenient to use and it's at normal because it's highly visible it makes it look like it's a it's a cool thing to do to ride a bike so the outcomes being reducing emissions reducing congestion and improving mental health physical health uh resilience in the community um helping retailers and so on so the really really measurable outcomes and so we're starting to put numbers to all those outcomes now um and so that'll be the next report which more detailed um a big upshot so as soon as there was an after we announced launching it in christchurch we had um literally um property owners from queenstown driving up to christchurch and saying can we get some down here we had napier city council have written their own licensed occupy agreement for us to put lockheed oxen to napier uh palmerston north new plymouth taupo taronga hamilton auckland we're currently installing in auckland wellington at the moment back of the initiative in christchurch so it started here first I want you to all know that um and so as a consequence so the government is um hugely supportive of this so you see um minister of energy megan woods there and minister of transport michael wood when we announced our rollout plans nationwide in wellington last year both of them came out on the night to speak and and even wakata has offered us a site on welles street in wellington as a model for more sites um publicly owned sites across the country uh here's a list of all the people who places where they want to have more locky docks than christchurch so yeah yeah there's more and more um so just as a reminder so it's a self-funded public infrastructure model so it's free to the public and to the property owner and it's made possible through um content partners and sponsors and so this is where it's community engagement comes you know the likes from the council from christchurch nz from other local businesses and brands like the signals to say hurrah thank you very much so this is the end thank you so much um your time is up that was the launch day last june um and I know that the bakery in rangiora is um getting rave reviews for having the lofty docks out there I don't know when they went in but um yeah yeah just just about a month ago right getting good reviews online which is good um so thank you very much for coming in and giving us an update on those um really good to see and I'm sure we'll see more of them around thank you absolutely right and now we have um professor chris kisling and mr trevor lord from the maclean's mansion charitable trust thank you for coming in today and giving us an update ah good morning and thank you for this opportunity um to talk to you about mclean's mansion and what progress we've been making there and in five minutes that's pretty short time long gallop our update to you today really is to convey considerable progress on the mansion within budget which remains valid and on schedule despite covert 19 delays and things like that and your heritage unit has commended and improved the approach that we have taken in spending that very significant landmark heritage grant that came through this council without a doubt I think if that grant had not been made the mansion would not have survived so we're very grateful so we're here today to ready to account to you on that progress chris and commencing the update I just wanted to begin by showing you the the photograph at the top and I think that says an awful lot about this impressive massive building of real big stature internationally that we're dealing with on the city's behalf by way of a perspective to open and it's very important this we're going to look at the heritage and cultural value of the mansion because this really underpins why we're bothering and why this is worth so much it's one of the world's largest victorian timber mansions it was built in a house and in fact one built for the rothschild family it was fitted out accordingly to a palace standard very rare in christchurch and sparing no expense interestingly it was the vision of mr alan mclean a very successful canterbury run holder and the important part here is that the house and fortune were actually destined for the care of women in need not just a house it was very much this vision it was a major statement and remains so even now for women's welfare internationally the mclean institute which he formed is arguably new zealand's first true social welfare model conceived in about 1898 and it's still operating and they're very keen to return to the mention some excitement there it's internationally unique and the main thing is it's right here in the christchurch cbd introducing the project we first spoke to the committee in mid-2016 we outlined then our vision and purpose which was to restore and preserve the mansion uh it was a multi as a multifaceted attraction for the city and community with paid entry at the time we history etc and even include an art gallery a grant of 1.934 million was duly awarded in december 2016. and this came from the central city landmark heritage grant fund and we believe with gratitude it was and remains the largest heritage grant ever awarded by the city so the mention was purchased or the agreement to purchase was a little bit later in august 2018 and in january 2019 the heritage covenant aspect of that purchase was resolved with the mortgagor and work started continuing into looking at progress at this slide gives you some idea of what's been going on to restore this building required the foundations to be remediated that has been done with some quite clever engineering it's done the building is now level and the internal strengthening can continue and the net result of all that is that this building will well exceed the national code national building standards on the slide in that you've got in front of you it gives you some of that sort of detail and we've only got one minute left apparently so we'll push an educational charitable trust which gives us wide scope the business plan has transitioned to a commercial tenancy model which allows us in our free public access simpler and more sustainable model for the trust to administer and it provides a means to continue the building preservation from income the present model still holds as fundamental principles things like education and activities and arts music heritage and cultural significance of the mansion as a vibrant and vital community asset when few such options still exist in the cbd is an internationally iconic presence for tenants we're currently negotiating with the christchurch school of music and the mclean institute as I mentioned before as major users that could see things like 1200 students 40 practice rooms on saturday and so on with some funding required and it preserves the mansion's original and intended community purpose and social roles really to conclude anyone who um doubted that this significant heritage building could not be restored and made available for future violent use can put those doubts aside um there is however no hiding the fact that as a trust we family their interest-free uh three-year mortgage that they have on the land we are open therefore to suggestions for help to assist us to get to that point from any source whatsoever I'll leave it at that thank you very much and I'm sorry you do have you have reached the end of your time there but thank you for the update and people have had a chance to read the whole presentation already and so um there may be further communication I guess between us um in the future great thank you very all right no deputations by appointment no presentation of petitions so now we move on to paper seven the proposed consultation on freedom camping by law changes welcome thank you thank you very much um you can take the report as read but if you could give us uh the the quick update on the um the government's new plans and why we're still going ahead with this that would be really useful sure um do you want me to do a summary of the final changes very quick um so I need to review it and we need to complete the review otherwise the bylaw will lapse um so we've been working on this um for some time and you had a report about this in october last year which is the first step in the review this is the second step um so we've got some um changes that we're recommending which generally we think the boiler is working quite well but the review gives us an opportunity to update and improve things where we can um the in the meantime since um preparing this work the government has proposed changes to freedom camping nationally um these proposals will likely lead to changes to the freedom camping act which this bylaw is made under so the key point here is that the national changes won't be finalized for some time perhaps late next year by the time the legislative changes go through so we need to complete the review of our bylaw including this consultation phase at the moment or a by-level lapse which means it automatically revokes the bylaw changes that we're proposing here so they'll be on a much faster track um once the national changes are finalized there'll be an implementation process um there might be regulations that's under it for example so that will push the dates out even further and there's strong support for this by-law so we don't want to risk not having a bylaw while we're in a place of legislative uncertainty um so we need to be clear about that in our consultation information including the statement of proposal so there's a small amendment um to that referenced and the additional recommendations which were in the supplementary memo which was circulated the time frames for the council to make a submission um on the national consultation are also quite tight so there's a recommendation to delegate the finalization of that submission um to the chair of the committee and members that want to be involved thank you very much and I think if can we see all of those recommendations up there um so the additional recommendations and I think that's put um councillors turner and daniels on with that seem to be this morning okay and um number 10 there has changed um to sort of gone in with the original one is that right yeah from the very top because otherwise they were repeating themselves no other changes from the ones in the memo though no okay any questions yeah yeah so any questions first yanni thank you thank you for the work that you've done on this um under the um page 28 uh paragraph three north beach car park you talk about um the fact that uh the number of freedom campers and 37 has reduced from high levels um but you're still saying there's still a steady number of campers in the area I despite the lack of international travelers I guess what I was trying to understand is what sort of um uh what are we seeing in regards to people who actually need housing like is this sort of people that are homeless or transient or living in cars versus I guess the perception of you know young people coming from overseas or around new zealand freedom keeping is that because we put a temporary closure on that car park sort of over the last year that has meant that we've seen a reduction in people camping there so that's been working quite well um the the the the range of campers that are in that area um is varied um there are absolutely some people who are genuinely homeless in there and some frequent freedom campers um the homelessness is not treated in the same way as freedom camping and so we wouldn't infringe somebody who's homeless and living under the vehicle we'd take a different approach to that which is um more sort of wrap around service and engaging with them and trying to see what we can do to support and encourage them to meet a more secure housing situation um so that the issues are quite separate in terms of how we would enforce the limitations in the bible so do we do we have a sense of the percentage of those that are freedom campaign for you know for leisure recreation versus um people that need somewhere to monitoring enforcement that's been done over the summer I don't have it with me at the moment but I can I can find out from the adjustment team thanks cheers any further questions no in that case do I have a mover for the staff recommendations this is yup tim thank you and um phil for seconding do I have any debate um tim you know first of all thank you very much for this and it is I'm a hell of a lot of work having to do redo bylaws every five years so and this has been a particularly hot potato there's no question about it just just want to remind people that they are in a coveted situation so the pressure is off a bit so which we've kind of been taking a breath for a while but the two areas that are mentioned richard naval point and north beach which have been problem areas without question there are other areas around christchurch which were added to when those were put in so just we're not out of the park yet the future but I do commend the staff for what they do and also our regulatory staff who go there and try and make the assessment between homeless and freedom camping because there is a very big difference to that so thank you cheers thank you andrew thank you um yeah I would agree that the current bylaw is working well but equally I would agree that um there is a continued need for a bylaw um I'm certainly pleased to see the um changes to the national situation proposed by government um I've certainly commented in this chamber before about the need for some changes to the act and the national situation and some consistency and the proposals that government have put forward pick up some of the discussions and recommendations of the local and central government working parting of which I've been a part since its inception so I'm pleased to see some of that work finally been picked up as stated in the memo which is in the agenda the proposed changes from government don't affect our need to review the bylaw where we can continue to do that anyway um I i welcome the review I welcome the um proposal and the changes that are proposed within it and thanks staff for what I know has been a significant amount of work to get this to the point where we can consider it today um reflecting some of tim's comments I am aware of some concerns and some issues in different parts of the city some of them certainly are picked up in the proposed changes in the um document that's in front of us the draft documents in front of us um I regularly get comment from people in the community about freedom camping issues or things that people are not happy about or would suggest improvements to and of course in various different parts of the city they manifest themselves differently consulting on this draft bylaw is the opportunity for people to have their say on that and to make those comments in a more formal sense and I know there are some people out there who have got comments who are waiting for this opportunity who I would encourage those people and others to take that opportunity to provide their views on this proposal um and certainly I welcome that consultation feedback so fully supportive of this today thank you any further debate no in that case I'll put this all those people please say aye those against declare that carried thank you very much thanks tina um now we move to paper h the mayor's welfare charitable trust bequest so sam check do you want ann and I to participate or stand back from this right if you've got a conflict you've got a conflict well we're on the trust but so it's not for me to decide your conflicts yeah I'd ask at the beginning of the meeting for decorations of interest but if you you declare them during the meeting and I think that that sounds sensible um so we're not making no there's a recommendation from the trust to be honest I don't see yeah that's not my decision on whether you feel conflicted or not okay excellent we'll just you give us a just a brief summary curacao yeah sure um so the network chad will trust received a bequest many years ago and it's been slowly accumulating in the in the trust accounts and it's currently 690 000 but because of the low interest environment it's not returning a lot to the trust so the committee um which two councils here are on as representative and a whole lot of uh representatives from social agencies discuss the best use of it uh staff recommendation was to use it as grants over a five year period to help those uh experiencing hardship and distress others on the committee felt we could it could be invested to give long-term return uh with one possibility being into community housing to also increase housing stock in that area in christchurch so the report in front of you has the committee recommendation to asking council to to ask staff to investigate investment options and there's also staff recommendation as discussed to use it as grants so should council go ahead and choose to ask staff to investigate investment options some of those options and the option to distribute the bequest as grants over five years time for you as a council to decide the way forward and then the committee would go ahead and um continue on with with that delegation thank you and when could you get that information back to us uh we're hopeful we could come back and at the july meeting which is our next meeting yeah that's great thank you jake um I guess a small matter why is this why have you sought to write a report to ask us for permission to go investigating different options as opposed to just investigating the options and then bring you back two-fold one is it can take quite a lot of staff time and work and therefore if we go ahead and do all that investigation and discover that council have no interest in them as well for charitable trust making an investment then that's been a pointless body of work so we wanted to get the direction of council um it's it's your delegation rather than the committees and but we didn't think it was worthwhile putting that work in if it didn't have any interest to us counsellors thank you tim as this originally came and so part c is what we discussed with regards to changing the the initial with which was putting investing it into social housing um would we not be better just to get some feedback on the economics or the investment environment at the moment and then that being brought back to council because originally this was to invest into social housing which I obviously we've changed it so rather than a report could we not get some we've got um christchurch and zid which have apparently have a very good feel of the investment cycles we've also at cchl which could actually give some very good information to our staff I'm just wondering about that I mean this has just happened this morning the changes so so that would be part of a report to include um back to you the investment environment okay that would inform the actual decision thank you in july thank you report you say you received 750 requests for support in 2019-20 a year totaling eight hundred 358 the grants how much do the requests total uh it's not quite that simple because we don't ask for a specific amount what are you requesting yeah it'll be a bit uh variable say for example a typical request might be a highly overdue power account which has been increasing sometimes up towards of two thousand dollars owing uh and and we'll work with that person and with some other agencies to try and you know to ensure they don't get their power disconnected and we might grant say six hundred dollars so I couldn't tell you exactly what the requests were for because people don't come with a set amount they just come with their distress and we seek to assist the so are you turning people away because of lack of funds or do you find the fund is sitting there it's pretty well balanced in terms of um what we've got coming in on an annual basis and what we're there but we we control the the the point of request has has some funnel to it uh with with greater funds we could increase that funnel and increase the amount we could um because currently um what are you bringing in from the um dividends and strengthening communities is is it 300 and something it's around it varies but it's around about 350 000 quite close to what you're yesterday thanks to your director's fees and the strengthening communities so you wouldn't be dipping into the bequest money very much every year we're not as no because we currently that's set aside and and under kind of a different delegation so we don't dip into it there's a small amount of interest that is returned however the decision from council could change the way the committee you know distributes grants to help more people um because we then could dip into it should that decision be made yeah and just one more question if I may um with the government's winter power um grants are you seeing less people see these people because that's a reasonably generous amount isn't it yeah I think it changes maybe the timing a little bit so we're seeing people now because it hasn't kicked in yet uh and then what we find in winter we we often do a little bit more in the firewood space than in the power um and then once that with the fuel package comes off um it can it can kick back in again for people so yeah it does does change it a little bit but still some people get themselves in and they find themselves in a really difficult situation and that winter fuel package isn't enough to to get them out so that we still see that thank you thank you any further questions pep james happy to meet you happy birthday the recommendations are up there now the recommendations are really now okay with a sec and you've got the second t in phil pot and one now too yeah yeah okay do you have a second jake any debate no in that case I'll oh that the committee is supportive of this because we're aware of the the growing need um people are coming to the mayor's welfare to otalpur which means support and that need is only going to increase so there's that tension between being able to respond to that need but also to sustain the the fund so that we can continue to respond in the future so this is about investigating options for maintaining the fund so I'm really happy that it's going to be supported today and we look forward to the report but I'd also like to acknowledge the work that sam and brian pigler do in this space brian particularly is the front person and deals with those who come needing assistance and is incredibly compassionate and supportive and I feel very proud to be chair of this committee it's uh we do some great work so thanks sam that's great done thank you and I'm really happy to support this because um I think this is what it should have been the beginning to invest and to look the amount available to the needy and who who requires it rather than just concentrating on social housing so which it was originally so I'm really pleased to support this thank you um yeah anything andrew uh yeah um yeah I'm happy to support this although I do think um you know it I hope this doesn't um get mean that we don't look at the housing just to show you the housing register from 2018 10 000 people gone up to 22 000 december 2020. so there's a massive need for housing uh social housing affordable housing community housing in our city um and in our country so I just wanted to um you know say that I think we should certainly be looking at what we can do but you know I think this is sensible that we look at what's the best option to create a sustainable income source for the mes welfare fund which will grow in need and demand and currently just having money sitting in a bank getting very little interest is not really a very sensible use you thank you a sustainable approach would definitely suggest considering investing this for the long-term benefit of the fund rather than simply distributing as grants at the current time although I accept and respect the comments made by anne around the tension that definitely does exist there and I think it's important that we keep the distribution option alive to consider once we've got this report back a sensible approach would be to consider all reasonable and viable investment options which should in my view consider investing in social housing if that is a secure investment with reasonable returns and I'm sure that's something that will be considered the key is that this is about investing sensibly for the long-term benefit of the fund if there can be a follow-on benefit for social housing that delivers additional social outcomes then um that's something I certainly would welcome I think it's important to note that this report and the recommendation is simply asking for the investigation to be done we're not making an investment decision today um I welcome the results of the investigation all of the options that that puts in front of us so that we can then choose to invest for the benefit of the fund and so that the great work that the um as welfare fund is able to bring about is able to continue thank you anyone further no in that case I'll put the recommendations all those in favor please say aye any against no degree that carried thank you very much thanks sam next we moved to the heritage incentive grant for five shelley street in sydney so welcome brendan the first of um three of these today and if you could give us just a short summary and we'll move to questions yeah victoria's just nipped to the lucha being in in two ticks just to cover this one because this was her report um and I think there are some specific things she wants to just make sure that you're aware of so okay just bear with us for that apologies that's right and would you like to move to the next report the dorset straight players um yeah that one thank you move to dorset street flats paper ten all right um and it just gives a quick summary and then we'll move to questions yeah so I think amanda's here um for this one um this is the the miles warren designed series of of apartments at dorset street um pretty groundbreaking for its time and um very much a uh a nationally and internationally recognized piece of architecture um which has been um severely damaged in the earthquakes but the owners have clubbed together which is um quite difficult when you imagine you've got eight different owners here that they all have to resolve their own insurance issues and come together and decide to repair the building or or not and in this case they've obviously decided to to do that so um it's it should be a good outcome the repair work has has started because they've had to proceed with some of the um some of the the work um to get on with it so um it's a um it's a show that they've the project um anything else to add to no I think we've covered it all nothing here okay any um questions for amanda or um brendan sam yeah thank you no I've probably missed it in the report but are they currently occupied oh no so they haven't been used since the earthquakes no they're significantly damaged so they've had to they've had to move out right okay so they haven't been used as earthquakes no but they have been secured that's the important thing they were they were bike stock plywood and what's the intention so they get repaired are they going to be owner occupied again or will they be yeah so that'll all be under october yes yeah okay so they're going to sell some because it's got a few of them own a couple of flats each um I think some of them some of them own two two flats yeah it's all the model actually was was in the initial model was to to have an owner who leased out another flat mars warren that they they knew that they could they could sort of self-support their existence by having the one that they rented out so that was the model now I know things have moved on since then but um although other people do own yes there are a couple of owners who own a couple of of the units yeah but they're they have to work together to to fix them anyway because you're sorry we may not understand you you're explaining it really well but the so the people that own them now are they going to go and live in them after well um yeah um I don't have that information so some of them will be over occupied I think some will continue to be rented out right yeah the important thing is they will be fixed yeah right there are some owners who own multiple flats and that that's been a mechanism to to help save the buildings because some of the owners have had to sell due to finances okay thank you thanks pauline yeah yes the total cost the the code at the time when these were built back in the 1950s early 60s they there was no insulation in them um they're very small units so the the logical way that you would you would insulate these would be to strap and line them internally now that would do two things one it would reduce the size of the unit but also it would cover over the the fabric and it's that exposure of the construction fabric which is important so yes in some degrees that they're going to have to accept that these are always going to be uninsulated buildings because if you do try and insulate them you can insulate the roof you can insulate the elements where you can hide the insulation but to insulate the walls would be to hide the the original heritage fabric luckily the other the other positive thing is because the party walls um they're like terraced houses they don't they don't lose heat as much because they've got a party wall as opposed to the end wall double glazing that's double glazing does mean you have to change the original um yeah um I think where where it can be done without without a loss of heritage values then then we we would encourage people to do that but obviously if there's if there's existing windows and they're perfectly fine then then it's it doesn't make sense to pull them out just to won't there be a time when this sort of building will be uninhabitable because it won't um comply with the health standards well my house is 1870 so I'm still living in it um I think I think you you you adjust and you make you make um provision for it yes you may have that we can't hear and the thing is this is council money that we're having being asked to put into it I mean I fully support it but I'm just concerned that with this it's an old cold and our moral duty to actually be yes yeah carolyn can you tune in my phone I think it's more than be rentals there's rental standards and those kind of things for insulation and healthy homes I think that um so but that's for the landlord to um it's landlords who have to have to comply with the legislation around rental standards but um but insulation and double glazing are building code requirements so I'm assuming that the project manager and the owners have sought advice from council around um around what they require to do to to comply with building code I guess that what we've got before you today is around the heritage fabric and I think that your question around the future I it's useful to reflect how technology is catching up on insulation and what you can achieve so what might be possible in the future for these buildings to meet building code and still be heritage buildings or still retain the heritage fabric um it might be possible we can't anticipate yeah yeah so okay thank you any further questions ah sorry jake then phil linton a quick one um what would be the consequence of not funding these be reduced what would be the consequence well um they would they would struggle to complete the work yes they've they've had to settle with their insurance companies there is there is a gap there is a funding gap so they are seeking ways to fulfill that gap um ways to to bridge the gap sorry so it would potentially I mean I can't speak for the individual owners but um it certainly could jeopardize the work but we don't know the individual finances of each owner we're judging it on the merits of the heritage values that are being retained thanks um did you want to yell at as you go just one as I walk out are they keeping it because it's a heritage building it has high heritage values so that that's that's they have faith in it as well okay thank you and tim um so there are eight of them and is it that two are connected and so there's a kind of separate so I'm just wondering if it's heritage value that we is it if we're after heritage value to protect then the unit the two units I think I think although there's there are two there are two separate blocks there they are very much linked there if you if you lose one it's it's it will lose a lot of the value I mean that they were originally designed as eight units for I mean that they were bachelor bachelor pads that's kind of slightly two different things though aren't they because one is we we're just debating here about the heritage value of a building or buildings but the other one is the social value of what they were trying to achieve back then so there are two different things here but the fund is about the architectural fabric of the building yeah but but there are it would be difficult to decide for example which of the four you would keep you would then be telling four owners that you're not getting funding you are how would you do that they they do have they have value as they are years without huge alteration um they they are a a an entity you know to to lose half of it would be a significant loss and undermine the heritage you'd reduce the architectural values quite quite a lot okay yeah yeah I know that there does seem to be some repetition in them but that's that's the point of them they were they were eight units pretty much the same with with modifications made on the on the basis of of uh what the owners were able to do or wanted to do with them so yeah I think it would be it would undermine the heritage values of the of the the the item to lose half of it they are listed as one item thank you green if I just check the um the amount that's recommended um while it's considered a certain percentage of the works proposed uh per unit it's quite a bit higher than we would normally do for um dwellings of this um of each individual size I was wondering if you got any comments on that so size that we've done in the past yeah well the the individual unit is is works out forty five thousand dollars per unit um I i didn't I that didn't strike me as being a large amount we actually would reduce the percentage you see the percentage has gone down to 25 so it it could have been more than that but that seemed to be um an appropriate figure um other comparisons we did where funding was um it is difficult to do comparisons with different types of building because we're dealing with with a modernist concrete block building here as opposed to a timber frame building and also the the need to to have cross-party uh cooperation in order to strengthen walls for example the our party walls so it seemed the figure was arrived at on the basis of one all of the criteria that we use but but amongst them is obviously the heritage value of the building what the owners can contribute but also what funding is available and the total funding at 360 000 seemed to be the right the support to individual owners but not not excessive so can I just clarify though if there had been less funding available before the end of the financial year you would have been happy to recommend less well we have to we have to bear in mind what funds we have available to to come up with a with a with a figure um and and the figure is either uh is based on a percentage or or or a more um nominal figure to show support for something of of this kind of um of this kind of work so um I mean we've particularly had in mind the fact that it's in 183 000 gap for each flat between the um insurance payout and the actual costs of the heritage works um so it's a it is a significant gap um which that that uh 25 will go towards helping and we referred back to other um buildings such as the the duncan's buildings which was a row of buildings in high street that we made a contributing contribution to yeah and they got 45 a a comparable grant some and and you can remember as well we're excluding those elements where the owners have chosen to upgrade things like kitchens that you know they're not they're not heritage so these this is the this is the the bones of the building that we're supporting here so they are having to invest further sums themselves if they want to to increase the the the level of amenity in the in the unit thanks um mike thanks the funding gap because of the insurance is because the the owners are choosing to um upgrade it from 34 which they got um settled for up to 67 yes that's a I guess that's a choice of them to do it is a choice but but it gives them that resilience to to you that if the code changes slightly you won't get caught and become an earthquake prone building sam sorry just one last quick one it's just to follow what I was saying before so do we have a sense of the intention of these buildings once they can't find out here are they going to be built and then unsold are they going to be built rented out are they going to be built or are they all being moved into by the owners have you talked through that in your discussions with them no it's not a conversation I've had um I guess the important thing for us is that they'll continue to be used for residential purposes as they were originally built um the important thing for us is that they'll continue to be used for residential purposes so that's that's been our main concern they have a history of being owner occupied or rented out as far as I know that's going to continue okay james uh look what councilman major said I'm I feel similarly however I recognize that there are heritage values but how many of these do we have on our books of this this of this sort of nature because you know I i know those flats I used to party in them but um but you know where does it the heritage values these are these are the first the first of their type they're the prototype designed by one of the books sorry when I say on our books on our as a response register that's a word yeah well they're on the district plan um list of heritage buildings we don't have anything else we don't have anything else like these on on the schedule in the district plan um in terms of modernist post-war buildings um we have a handful okay the town hall um so miles warren's office in flat and cambridge terrace is is similar but this you know this buildings of new zealand architectural significance in terms of the story of how our architecture developed well I'm not being flippant when I say yeah and they're a similar and maybe they follow he was following um miles warren on the corner of andover and cheltenham and they just got re done up I used to live there and they were by um oh god what's the other peter bevin I think and they're similar many were on the register yeah and I know that they're in the district plan thanks and we are yeah um I wanted to follow on a little bit from your comments about um some miles warren and how significant this is for us as a city given that we're growing our reputation as being internationally a really interesting place to be for people to come and view our architecture how important is samal's warren to our city and to our nation um well yeah from an architectural perspective he is hugely important um these flats were a pivotal work at a turning point if you like um I think he'd just come he'd come back from england um he had these new ideas about styles materials use of concrete um and so he he put those to use in little christchurch um and it can be seen as a turning point I guess in at the start of the development of the christchurch modernist style which is our familiar concrete you know white painted concrete block buildings which unfortunately we've lost a lot this really is a a key stone point in the development of christchurch and new zealand architecture and they're probably fundamental in miles warren's career without this sort of starting point every architect of of of significance needs to to get off the mark and these were some of those buildings which allowed him to to then proceed to to bigger things without these small steps at the start there wouldn't be a warren amani potentially so I think we need to move on a little bit so it's it's clear that they have high heritage value but the room seems to have some just quiet over the um the amount being recommended today so at this point do we have a mover for the staff recommendation or for a different amount so staff recommendation jake and melanie second okay um we will indeed um I'm just just checking the room at this stage to see if there's anything any further questions or first there's no checking for foreshadowing I'm happy to foreshadow that would decline the grunt well we wouldn well that just came to the room but just whether there was a foreshadowed yeah yeah just whether there was a foreshadowed motion um for a different amount if anyone was wanting to do that okay um okay in that case jake will start um yeah I guess as the local councillor for this area I just wanted to set a scene of where these flats are located they're in a really unique part of our city that residential cbd that has a huge amount of history not just both built but also um cultural history in that area as well and and I know better than anyone how how uh badly these areas have been affected by by um high density uh um poorly thought outland and um you know rubbish buildings um which I yeah um and I guess I also thought this is again a prime piece of cbd real estate that um is sitting on valuable land and the owners would have absolutely been better to to bowl these and and put up something less um less sympathetic to the area so I think we deciding on this thank you tim I thank you just to kick off um it was warren and marnie so morris manny was absolutely a genius and if you've seen his hand drawn pictures and designs for the town hall not through cad but hand drawn he was an absolute genius so I just wanted to throw that in there I love the irony of this the um dorset streets flats were described as the ugliest buildings in christchurch just want to remind you and the regards to size if you look at some of the flats that are exorbitant prices at the moment and one can debate the equality um at six hundred thousand four hundred fifty thousand etc I think these are a bargain to be quite honest and if you look at the land values that the neighbours have been trying to sell one of those places at a number of million um I think that um it's important heritage to keep because they could be bogged because the land values jake is described per square meter is I think well and truly absorbent but discuss the value of the architecture that's what we're here to protect um I'm no architect and I'm no historian so I will go on this the recommendations of the staff I do debate sometimes about the quality but it is like art and the irony I love is all the discussion with regards to intensity of intensification etc in our city and the questions on architectural value etc this is the wonderful thing that they were described as the ugliest buildings in christchurch and they are now um listed as a new zealand uh um landmark heritage site of buildings so I think it's a wonderful irony and I'll be supporting staff thank you sam uh yeah thank you as sort of uh mentioned earlier on and by sort of signaling potentially a foreshadow I won't be supporting this in its current form and it's not because I don't value heritage in the city I think that's really important to clarify um but it's a question of priorities across the city at the moment and this is a uh these block of flats effectively these units and probably there's two things that stood out the first one was around I think your questions here which are very very good in terms of the budget allocation um and the need for that being changed over time and you know the answers with respect I don't think we need to be um going down the line of because there's money in a budget we should therefore spend it and you know it does become frustrating because it becomes a constant excuse uh or I guess a reason to drive a value um but when we're making real sacrifices in the city at the moment you know we're having to stop um unless it gets changed in the ltp that mobile library van um you know which costs a fraction of this and a range of other issues uh that you know we have to make some real sacrifices so I would just hate to get to a point where these get rebuilt repaired and then potentially given the market movement have on sold and effectively'm not sure that would be a wise investment for the rate pass so I would urge colleagues to potentially not support this today while still acknowledging the importance heritage plays in our city thanks ann thank you I think the rate payers will be paying uh we'll be investing in heritage and um sir miles warren has been described as the doyan of post um what he describes the first new zealand to be knighted for services to architecture and really christchurch is is sir miles warren's place and known for that and this is something to celebrate into treasure and so um this is about putting a v we can't put a value on these things and economic value this is important for us as a city for us our identity so I will be supporting the staff recommendations today thank you mike thanks I'm unsure if actually some my colleagues have read the report this building has currently been repaired it's not getting demolished this decision is whether we actually contribute um to how much these private owners are going to pay's actually above the insurance settlement is because they're increasing the mps so I'm I'll actually be agreeing with sam and will not be um used to this thank you um melanie um these are category one listed heritage building so I in my opinion if anyone won't support um putting money towards these they shouldn't be supporting any heritage in our city really because it's clearly the view that they're taking and it would be good to have more housing available once um once they're completed so um you know one one um any further debate yeah yeah um look to me here at notwithstanding it's um what is it level one um class one heritage what it's like art to me you know what's heritage to someone is not necessarily heritage to me and my heritage can often not be heritage to anyone else so it's subjective to me as is art I appreciate the reminder that it has been called the ugliest building in the city and um but it was still good to party in you know I'm struggling with this full stop um and I think that councillor mcdonald made a very good point notwithstanding why we're even talking about this uh through policies and and so on the principle is that the mobile libraries which I'd never use in a month of sundays but that is important to the ratepayers and residents of the city and that's what 91 000 I think it was well that's crazy that we say no to that and yes to this so that's why I'm saying no to this um aaron it's been an interesting debate today um especially around people's tastes and architecture and uh and and and it's correct it is in the eye of the beholder um I do uh appreciate the value of these to the city um I would have preferred the quantum of the grant was smaller and uh and on mike's point that they hadn't gone so high on the nbs and that stuck with the 34 because it would be um considerably different it did say seismic strengthenings for the um next event um given how often the events come uh then you and I know the alpine fault 75 due within a 50-year period so on and so forth um but if you do the math you'd actually go with the 34 and uh and just repair again if you had to uh so I and people would have been safe so I um agree with mike on that one and so I would have supported a smaller amount but not this amount karen would like to foreshadow a motion for a smaller amount what would that amount be up to you hasn't he already yeah yeah um I i would be interested to hear if someone else foreshadows a smaller amount you think I'm also quite struggling with this one um but I don't think comparing apples with peers like mobile libraries with a heritage fund is particularly helpful here we have a heritage fund that we've set up because we um are passionate and committed to retaining and repairing the heritage that we have left the little heritage events look I'm happy to take staff advice on this because you are all over the heritage in our city they've come to you for this you're recommending it so on this occasion because I'm not an expert on this I'm happy to take staff guidance on this and and support it particularly in the light of the information that we know this is a renowned building throughout new zealand so I think it's in our interest to retain it so in light of that I'm going to support this today thanks pauline and I think I'd like to add as well that um you know I think that we have a fund which as councillors we signed off on in the annual plan last year and we signed off a certain amount that could be spent up to we don't have to spend it all absolutely but we also opened applications and I think that if someone with our category one building who has applied for this fund doesn't qualify uh I think we really need to seriously re-look mobile library let's remember that as councillors we agreed um during the long-term plan process to propose that that um be closed at the same time as signing off on a proposal that left heritage funding there so I think that's a decision for a future discussion over the ltp after submissions these are category 1 buildings and I'm happy to support some funding for them today like aaron I'm a bit concerned about the amount um and so I'd like to foreshadow a motion of 240 000 which is 30 000 each should this resolution fail um to check with staff sorry I'm just out of the proposal to reduce their quantum but there's a equip grant is that um only paid out if it's matched by the local foreign uh no that grant's independent it's totally independent um and it's only for two of the flats which had an even lower insurance settlement okay cool and just um if we go down to 240 or 200 this would still qualify for full coverage we're in debate but wait but if we get okay so yeah so though the um covenant would still be in place just to clarify brendon with a lower grant the covenant the covenant um yes the covenant comes in at 15 000. so that's a limited continent yep right and yanny give it to your debate oh sorry I i thought um if it was over 150 000 it was a full covenant that's right but there is a difference there's there's a limited covenant which is between 15 and 150 and then once you're over 150 then it becomes a full covenant right full covenant is in perpetuity um and has has more um constraints within the document it's a it's a more um but the key question is with serious foreshadowed quantum the full covenant would still be able to be what on this property only only if the owners are are accepting of that there is no there is no requirement in the grant criteria to have a full covenant below that figure okay you only you only you only go to 150 000. is actually we've got a number of heritage items in our city so I am concerned about the quantum of the grant and I would prefer a reduction um so I prefer to support the foreshadowed amendment rather than the substantive because we've got so many other priorities for heritage in our city as well we just heard from a group this morning thank you any further debate jake would you like to close no jimmy because original I'm reluctant to debate but now I'm still concerned the amount of the the funding because why if they go with the insurance their full coverage 1.5 million dollars but they want to upgrade upgrade from the 34 percentage mps to the 67 they have a show for the 1.4 million dollars so actually these you know when there's requests we can find in 25 percentage but amount is still quite a lot particular compared to pure wastewater maybe lacks wine no it's a 366 the case they're a big amount but your full coverage we don't need to clean anyone so shadows can minimize I would like to go to the either yani or service one two two hundred k or two forty because three hundred sixty six cases a big amount from repair I think is unfair to vote those surveyed here thank you very much if there's no further debate I'll put the um staff recommendation um all those in favor please say aye those against no I declare that lost um and we'll move to the well it's it's lost and we move to the next one I'm sorry yeah yeah foreshadowed motion which is the same except for the the dollar amount um 240 000 which makes them 30 000 each and I don't think we need any more debate on that one um do I have a second of that though jake thank you that's me and jake kendrick I know you can't no no you can't move you can't_''_5227.84 do an amendment this is a different motion there's a new motion all together so jake's fine yeah um right in that against our division council achievement yes councillor councillor coco councillor cotter yes councillor daniels no councilman davidson no counselor galaway yes councillor goff councillor joe hanson yes councillor cuen councillor mcdonald's no councillor mcclellan thank you very much okay and now we move back to uh the heritage incentive grant for five shelly street welcome victoria oh right um thank you very much so we'll be the next one here um so if you'd like to just give us a quick summary and then we'll go to questions thank you yes thank you um okay big one to follow um I'm here with a report in front of you that recommends the committee supports the retention of the little brick cottage at five shelley street by approving a heritage incentive grant fund for maintenance works to keep the building weather tight and in constant use this little brick cottage is a very prominent key feature in the local landscape it's part of the identity of the neighborhood it's also very important contextually because it tells the story of the development of sydney specifically residential suburb the owner of the cottage has spent the last 10 years plus out of the building fighting with her insurance company trying to get a decent insurance payment rather than have it as an insurance write-off_,_5394.08 she's now got a settlement in place and the works have begun but she's been left with certain elements that didn't get funded which were considered to be pre-existing damage that was rotten timberwork and joinery to the back of the building defective weatherproofing and flashings and the need for a new roof and she's come to request an incentive grant to help support those works that weren't covered by the earthquake funding that's great thank you very much do we have any questions on this one no questions okay then do I have a mover time second that melanie um any debate no those in favor please say aye those against declare that carried thank you very much that was really interesting britain street okay um so back to amanda all right let's just swap his seats now then I'll be back after to questions sure um so this this is a building which is not scheduled in the district plan but it does have historical social and architectural significance it's a landmark in linwood really because of its location on sand hill and with its landscaping of concrete walls and steps the house needs re-levelling and maintenance and repair work the current owner purchased it last year and didn't receive any insurance money for those earthquake works so um this grant she's looking to have some assistance with those costs that she's taken on by taking on this building which she wants to retain for its values thank you very much melanie you have a question um my question was just why um is it not listed in the um district plan as a heritage building uh well it quite possibly would meet the threshold um based on the initial research and assessment we've done it it could well do there are potentially hundreds of buildings which aren't on the schedule yet but which meet the threshold we just haven't had time to research and possibilities out there thank you tim um the the current owner purchased this as is whereas that was advertised as is that correct I'm not sure if it was advertised as is whereas but that that was the circumstances that she said it was brought in as is thank you any further questions like the the cost estimate in there to repair 130 000 um is that everything that needs to be done to the house and then it's up to I guess an insurable livable standard uh yes as far as I know okay any further questions no in that case I have jake as mover so the secondary melanie um debate tim yeah thank you um this is I think very different to the print to the previous one whereas the previous one was a recognized heritage building this isn't it was bought one would presume cheaper than um standard market rate under as is wearers and generally when you walk through a house that needs free leveling piling and foundations you're pretty well aware of it I certainly was aware of mine um that this is one that the owner bought with your eyes open and we should be preserving the money for heritage for recognised heritage buildings thank you melanie um I will obviously be supporting this um it's um just because it hasn't been recognized in the dystrophin doesn't mean it doesn't meet the threshold it just means that the work hasn't been done yet to put it there um so um and I think this one has a lot more heritage value than the category one doors of the street that I supported as well so um I think this is not a lot of money and um it's you can see from looking at the building it's clearly got heritage value and based on what's in our report thank you any further debate jimmy sorry thanks uh just briefly look this isn't he's a listed heritage building uh my view is that there needs to be a line in the sand if it's not on the register then I find it hard to justify it especially when there through so no support from me thank you any further debate no in that case I might sorry echo what tim said I have concern when um you know we have applications from people that buy properties at a very low rate because they're as is wearers and then come to council with with their handout to help do them up the thing is that someone could buy that say okay I could pay that for that and apply for a council grant and I could save the building so I'm going to support this thank you james just trying to think that through the day the building is safe yeah I got that bit um I think it's a valid point and therefore I'm uh not going to be supporting this recommendation okay is there any further debate around the table no okay in that case um all those in favor please say aye those against division from the street councillor templeton hi councilman mcclellan oh my councillor mcdonald's no councillor johansson councillor galloway daniels oh no councillor coker yes councillor cheney no council you very much lost okay um we'll now move on to the intangible heritage grant application for teputahi architectural audio tour welcome back victoria if you could give us a quick summary then we'll move to questions thank you thank you all um this is the first of the intangible heritage grants from the new scheme that you established for us in the annual plan I've put down a recommendation that the committee support the creation of a digital architectural tour of our city by approving this grant the grant will allow um t putahi to develop a free-to-use accessible and innovative new approach to showcasing and publicizing our heritage and an exciting and engaging way so that the stories of the buildings and the parts of the city that have got significance now and for the future can be shared as the unique tonga that they are the 30 000 grant will provide a tour on an app of 10 key landmark buildings across the city some are recognized as heritage items they're in the district plan some aren't places like our new wonderful still an important part of our architectural heritage and the stories that sit behind that building and why and how it was created are just as valuable to capture now for the future so it's looking at heritage as it was but also the future heritage that is to come locals and visitors will be able to access this and engage more with the heritage of the city and the stories and the diversity of those stories that are such a part of christchurch city the other thing to remember with it is that it is the first of this type of tool the applicants have also said that they will be offering it up for free to use it will be provided on a creative commons license which means that it will go to our libraries and I was talking this morning to our libraries about it it will go into the canterbury stories into our digital repository there and then it can be accessed by anybody through the library system it can be added to the information that's on the gibson wall as part of that and follow this model and make their own tours so we have a group in woolston who are looking at doing a wonderful woolstone tour they've identified places they can use this as a model or a template to gather their stories and pull them together I was at a community board meeting where there was a group looking at trying to do the same around wooden park and gather stories based on wooden park and places around there they'll also be able to take this as a model and a prototype and then build on it so this money is for these 10 items but it is also creating a wider prototype for other groups to feed into and use as a model that's great thank you very much any questions sam yeah thank you um it's a tough one because I do I like the concept I'm just trying to work out why well how many how many heritage staff would we have in it I don't know it might be a question for mary potentially but in the heritage team here be in our comms team do you think about 49 about 49 yeah so why wouldn't we with a concert like this because I do like it why wouldn't we just do it in-house because I see christchurch and zeta involved as well why would we grant money when we've got teams that know about this stuff um a large portion of this is actually going to the people who will be doing the oral histories the recorded the editing the story gathering and the research gathering they'll be going out to the open open christchurch festival and interviewing people there it's not something that sits traditionally within our role our role is to facilitate communities groups organizations to develop this kind of thing it's not something the council has ever really done themselves we've been more of a facilitator so has there been any consideration as to why we wouldn't do it I'm just thinking economies of scale because I like the concept of you know talking about doing it in woolston and the likes with different things if we able to get something in-house that makes it far more efficient far more effective than having to grant money so I think we've got carolyn who might be able to give a short answer so open christchurch is a privately um is a privately uh private initiative and um they uh taputahi uh um as the um christchurch center for architecture are advancing that they are so they are arranging all of the um all of the buildings that are open all of the insurance access all of the detail around that this is one component of that that that they've decided that they want to add this to their um to their offering for their program it happen it also happens that it can have a longer life I guess that staff have approached this on the basis that the council have signaled that they want to engage the community in looking at intangible heritage fund funding to enable us to start to acknowledge and encourage community groups to look at stories and I guess further information around the city of christchurch that doesn't rely on that's why this is not not something that um I've encouraged um to be an internal um thing I've I think that well I've perhaps wrongly read the queue that council would like community groups to pick up such initiatives and take them forward I think that one of the things is that it's in the um the heritage strategy but carolyn I think the one of the questions is from based on sam's this particular piece of work if council chose to use council resources to do it if there were available resources could we do it for a lower price I guess is what your question is yeah um given their number of volunteer hours and stuff so um having looked at the um work that he have done in other I guess in other sectors and in some of the um the place making work they are very cost effective and I doubt I i don't think that we would necessarily be able to achieve the same outcome well that's very alarming that's very alarming if we can volunteer hours as probably the moment but you look at the volunteer hours no no you can completely get that but there's a lot of costs in here that I would have thought we already have within our organization so if we can't do it for the same or if not less that's anyway sorry okay so yeah okay any further questions no in that case um do I have a mover for this one um melanie this time and secondary mike uh do we have any discussion jamie briefly look the ratepayers have already paid for saving a number of key heritage buildings in the city and I don't think they need to be up for it again uh to partially fund storytelling audio for them um look the app could even be a 99 cent or a pay pay app if people have a smartphone so um look I think again you you need to make a call of where it stops so um I'm not supportive of this tim um well I hope there would be some vision in the future with art gallery museum and ourselves involved so you can um look at um the what gap filler have done and write the whole story of christchurch the artworks that we have at citrus so I think this is a start but I think we could do so much more and whether we do it and I'd take sam's point that would be really good to have partners and others that could pay for it and enhance the city because I think this is a really good start to what could be yeah I won't be supporting it I mean 30 30 000 grant along with the in kind from the likes of christchurch nz I think as james said you know there is a constant drain on the ratepayer for a lot of this stuff there we have an organization with thousands of staff you cannot tell me there is not economies of scale by doing a lot of the stuff in-house we have experts in heritage we have a whole libraries team and a comms department if we can't facilitate a lot of this to doing a job properly so I can't support it melanie then um look when we looked at the heritage strategy and we then allowed for intangible heritage grants um and agreed as a council that we that we would support that it would seem strange to me that we then wouldn't go and support something there's an entire intangible heritage grant for telling the stories they can be done at a you know at a very cost effective way because we know that the way that these sorts of people work is very cost effective um and they put in lots of volunteer hours and they can they will be closer to the ground um than our heritage staff because there'll be a lot of people who'll be wanting to put these stories together um so it's just a no-brainer and I don't think thirty thousand dollars is actually a lot of money in the scheme of things and uh we often uh when whenever we have um discussions about giving uh funds to heritage buildings we often talk about how we make to them well this is the way that we do this this is a perfect use of money to make these beautiful places and buildings accessible people can't often go into them but they can learn about them and an audio tour is a perfect way for that to happen so very supportive of this it's a great use of resource developing something that is going to have a huge benefit to both growing awareness to our city residents but also those who are visiting the city because of the architectural and heritage values that we have here and christchurch nz and their destinations site talk about christchurch as their place so this is a way to open up that knowledge to to those visitors and to our residents so very supportive of this thank you anyone else no jimmy that's right sorry okay yeah I support this one because based on the staff you can mention this is a first intangible heritage grant application and we review those I have this strategy now particular not only cover tangible but also intangible intent to actually you know the history et cetera but this one star particularly mentioned fifa digital world libraries etc you know and also particularly focus on the those uh kind of across the whole city you know related to arc architecture the audio guide app etc I think that's very crucial for for us because we have to encourage this one this part of the history part of our the kind of story we need to promote and share with the you know the the one another I think that's input thank you anyone else no I'll be supporting this today I think one of the key things we do as a council is to try and encourage and enable community groups and organizations to do much of the work that some people think council should do um in the city I think that keeping this accessible for um everyone in the city via not just the app but by our libraries um making it accessible from a range of different sources is really important and with no cost attached I think that if we were to um start asking the that come from our community all the time then what we would be doing in the end would be asking our park staff to run our community gardens and we'd be asking every time someone came up with a new idea for a new environmental app we'd be saying oh listen um surely our staff could do that because we've got great staff in it and comms I think that enabling our community groups and our residents groups to pick up this to make the most of the community building that happens at the same time to make the most of the volunteer time that's involved is a really good for the city not just for heritage but for a range of other things as well so that's why I'm happy to support this today and with that I'll put the motion all those in favor please say aye those against those recorded declare that carried so um councillors mcdonald goff and chu and kewan against thank you very much that's carried right and we'll take a 15-minute break and come october through to march this year thanks martin I'm not I don't have my glasses on is that miranda next to you yes I can see that I can't see anything else okay um so welcome thank you very much if you can get um give us a bit of a run through that'd be great then we'll move into questions uh kiara my name is martin kaczynski from the urban regeneration team says miranda charles my colleague and we have the rest of our our team here as well to answer any questions uh so this is the suburban regeneration biannual report looking back at the period of october to march and um these just to repeat um these reports are looking at that period they're not necessarily um up to date since uh since march or looking forward um the this report as uh has been out to the community boards for comment and received no further comments uh the we've chosen to highlight in this report the progress made on the greening the east plan in linwood village and um post-construction monitoring in sumner village and uh suppose it ends on looking at the future of this report and the direction we would like to take future reporting to basically uh follow council priorities while um focusing mainly on projects that are are taking place in that that particular financial year instead of our current format which uh looks at every single one of our master plan and other priority areas um even when there isn't funding or progress necessarily within that reporting period sorry my hub is I'm constantly failing on me uh questions tim yeah yeah you think I first apologize I can't remember this coming to our community board so I do apologize for that but um I noticed that there's nothing with regards to the selling street shops it's very much so I'm just wondering with regards to in the next report I suppose I've we've got a community board briefing this afternoon which I'll discuss with melanie but I just want to really kind of wonder what that is I think that could be in the attempt to answer the question now if you like yes yes um the suburban regeneration biannual report was released for the community boards roughly about the time that um our omnibus briefing came around late last year and um at that time we we highlighted that the boards have been sent the report and and the date for feedback uh salwin street master plan uh their current project is a stormwater upgrade renewal project and the streetscape upgrade has been phased for later in the annual plan yeah so I kind of got split I think to the um and you'll be able to correct me if I'm wrong but the um landscaping has been removed and put into naval point which we agree but I i slipped up there again it's totally my bed but the other one was out to 2027 but it is an environment that is highly stressed so I just yeah because we've got the issue with nz uh nzta with brown street etc eddington school and a number of others so just yeah yeah I think it's probably a but thank you very much for the long-term plan as well personally I think it's a bit more than that what's in your submission yeah okay more questions yeah I was just interested in terms of it says that um change requests are considered throughout the year so like some areas we've got um in some ways it's a shame that we don't have the list of the projects but I know our community would got like a really good memo that showed a number of projects that weren't funded um so and it's got every project so you can kind of see like in phillipstown for example we haven't really done what we said we were going to do but obviously that's because of the four laning but what's the process to get reconsideration or re-collaboration calibration of things that um should have been done but haven't_''_7919.04 been done for whatever reason put into the into a better way of getting progress through the chair a recalibration of the master plan capital program was done a couple of current in that ltp at the time since that recalibration process I think we've been through another annual plan and now we're under a draft capital program in terms of prioritising projects I think we've previously messaged the community board plan is a good way for our boards to highlight their pro master plan capital priorities and in terms of how the current draft capital program is showing um decisions are still yet to be made so there may still be an opportunity to adjust that current view so just looking at like the kind of progress do you see gaps along um the the master plans do you see some areas that haven't really had the same level of resourcing that we should start thinking about if we wanted to um look at progress like are there any immediate gaps that spring to mind in our master plans of actions that we said we would do that haven't_''_7998.32 been done for whatever reason that you think are a greater priority now than before I think in many sorry miranda I'm just going to miranda's already indicated that the community boards are the other their plans are the indicators of where they might be gets or where the community boards seek priorities and that comes through the capital programme process in the decisions on what is put in the program and in what phasing rests as I understand it with council yeah okay melanie so two questions oh sorry two questions um which are related um the first one is is how many um suburban master plan projects are set out in future years they wouldn't be reported on at the moment at the moment showing in the draft annual plan we have work underway in linwood village and the main street upgrade some work on the main road master plan at mark's bay area there's also some funding being shared with the coastal pathway major cycleway from the master plan budget and under that must play in the ferry road master plan also showing is the finishing the upgrade through austin village main street and funding is allocated to new brighton must plan land purchases for proposed rma road would not make it into this report it appears that uh there's a two or three year um pause on master plan capital projects until approximately uh financial year 27 where edgeware and souwan street street upgrade have funding coming on board new brighton also has a several multi-year paws between purchasing land for the road extension and then following through road building and other public realm improvements in in that area so sorry a third question so um would it be much effort to actually just keep those in the report without adding anything in it so that they are continually reported on so they don't get forgotten you know they don't you don't need to update them nothing's happening but they can just sit there so that we can see them every time the report comes through yeah just a little section that says future projects or unfunded projects set to be complete I think that will depend on where the funding ends up sitting in the long term plan well as long as funding is there in the long term plan which the table on page one three one couldn't you if you took that table right out to um twenty thirty one so you put out the total figures but anyway my question is on page 131 um each week village fy 1819 it's about 9 000 dollars was spent the annual team what was that on and if you can't tell me now perhaps just a meme I would do might have been something in conjunction with this cycleway there was that some funny spent on the tree lighting project oh yeah but okay so that was when it was budgeted and it was just spent this year um so that's the total cost of that I'm not sure the exact figure but there was some funding allocated um from last year spent this year and that was on the tree lighting the work that went into that well actually it would be quite good would we be able to get some more detail around that because I don't know can you remember mike was it 15 000 or 25. so we're getting on how much that lighting cost um please because and also would be good to have more financial detail because with the edu master plan the community didn't want didn't have an appetite for any more disruption um after the cycleways and all the um the infrastructure repairs they went through in that village people were feeling the pain um for their businesses and I think we withheld something like 50 000 we pushed we pushed it out voluntarily to as you say 2027 I don't think we actually pushed it out that far but that's where it is now um and we kept back I think 50. so we're not sure how much of that 50 is left after that lighting project pauline would you like that so information through the community to the community board might be the best place for that yes okay and but possibly in this reporting as well yeah it's you know I think I agree with mel there's not enough clarity on on the figures there thanks okay um and then jimmy hi um I'm and how you um decide who who was involved and how you got that together and yeah just I'd like to know a bit more about that now is a great time to invite josh hi uh the community lead working group uh I understand is regarding the safety groups so both have been led both out of the community board and also with the um the inner city s revitalization group so the working group for greening the east that was set up by the community board in conjunction the inner city east revitalization group that working group consisted of three members from the community board as well as um three community members um and they helped set up a plan uh for greening the east alongside consultation with the wider community that they undertook on their own behalf um the safety group um this has been directed around particularly linwood village so it hasn't been a process that council was set up that's been set up by again by the revitalization group they've called members from various agencies I think in total the request table as staff as well as certain elected members are sitting around that table um and we've also got representation there from the mp um so it's a wide group it has a wide focus that it is evolving and shaping and we're looking at ways staff can incorporate that with other safety initiatives in the city thank you are young people involved at all are youth invited no comment uh there are other safety initiatives around the city particularly targeted around youth spaces and we do have our community development workers working both within the inner city east and that safety group in the central city so they're able to bridge that connection quite well um but at this stage there isn't a youth voice particularly on that group I would say that the group is cognizant though of the youth experience given that we've got social workers um and as well as police on that group that would be great if and going forward that that was a consideration when you you know getting these groups together to make sure there is that on to the facilitator of that group thank you or you could nudge jake beside you yeah um any further questions so you've got jimmy okay two questions on page 12 23 5.2 0.4 regarding to other potential survival regeneration project I remember the appeal with the council also not only mentioned these four bullet points but also regarding to the church corner one you know particularly in church corner late kind of shopping center that area try to improve upgrade I'm not sure why not here we have evaluated even their scoring is higher than the bishop there so I don't know whether it's a missed out or not council was presented a report around suburban um regeneration priorities and that included the heat map which I think was probably the um the part that you might remember and uh council where staff put a list of recommendations some year one priorities and then some future priorities and the year one priorities were as I recall the team remind me if I missed something central city and linwood village and and then there were priorities so largely that's what council staff are focusing on because there are no future year priorities that you resolved on but we do recognise that there are other parts of the city oh actually you also resolve to do some work on bishop and um and that's um that's uh that's where your direction to staff ended so that's what we've been working on okay so these are there also yeah why it's your way okay thank you the second one is regarding the uh the page 126 the southwest quadrant because I review your two kind of master plan synonym in the sewing street mustang but it is a south it's not the south west in southwest the geographic area have any master plan a moment no there's no suburban center master plans that came from the south west area towards horseville hornby yes uh that area the suburban center master plans were a post-earthquake response that were focused around the centers that had the greatest impact following the earthquake so the centres out towards the south west of and the loss of key facilities that drove most of the planning around the suburban centre master plans okay thank you yeah needing jake thank you um just one thing that doesn't really come through in the reporting on the master plans is the impact of district planning or land-use planning so if you read like um woolston for example where there's a lot of detail around relationship to buildings to ferry road um balkan scale talks about a number of um things that we'd like to see including signage but there seems to be no mechanism to pick up that as an action and and I guess the concern like if you take wallston for example we've now got four gas stations all in a short space of road that have got resource consensus planning permission so I just wondered um what would be the process to get um things that are mentioned in the master plans but not put into our district plan considered we have through the master plan process managed to drive some district plan outcomes of course you'll be aware time that these master plans were implemented and decided upon so in new brighton we did reduce the size of the commercial core and that was in response to the master plan process and similarly recently we did the plan change in littleton and that really was driving some of those outcomes that we saw in the master plan process um as part of our planning process we do investigate if there are the need to change district plan rules uh that would support centre growth or regeneration we would look to do a plan change if there was a specific instance where it was valuable to do a change that would support that regeneration need and I do hear your point there around some of the commercial developments post earthquake along the ferry road corridor maybe not being to the aspirations that were set out in the master plan um so the the change would need to go through a plane change process though so the good news is we're doing a district claim change now what's the process to get you to feed into those planning and actions and the master plans uh do I understand that there is a long list of the planning and I'm probably not the right staffing yeah I think that we might take this one can we get some advice on that because it's pretty disheartening when we're spending all this money and we've got all these great visions of these of these master plan areas and then we're seeing development that kind of you know isn't ideal okay so we've got um we've had some time already as a council looking at the future district planning changes that are coming so are you after some separate advice on any district plan changes that might be needed to enable um master plan outcomes to support the master plan to support the master plan outcomes that we've identified okay so for example signage is one that would seem to be you know a simple one hopefully um but I mean staff would have to go through and look at what we kind of see in the master plan and then talk to to make but you know I think the summoner one's really interesting like it's really good feedback around sumner and what it does for people I really appreciate you doing that research can I just check with staff if there was a piece of work that we requested that was to provide some advice on district plan changes that could uh help get the master plan outcomes and those nine master plan areas how much work would that be I think that's the district plan yeah yeah because um if that's work that's going to be done by maybe the master planning staff and then the district planning then then that seems like a significant amount of work that would take away from things that we've already prioritized um and just before we ask for that advice I'd like to have an idea of what that might take people away from we'll come back it would it would be I think it would be a combination of staff but it would it would be a significant input from district planning staff who plan the so we'll we'll check in on them okay so we'll we'll follow that up and see what's possible at the moment yeah okay um jake um on page 131 on that second table with the master plan according to financial allocation what um with the linwood village that 52k that's sitting in 1920 what's that for I mean I know there's 1.4 for 1920 after 21 22 in terms of the streetscape and then 61 after that but I just can't quite figure out the 52 and then why the 1.4 isn't in the financial year as it's as it is in the draft long-term plan so the limwitt village the 52 000 that's for the doris luss reserve upgrades and um the children's interactive play art the uh the first phasing of the linwood village funding that's to do the planning design consultation side of the lynnwood village streetscape upgrade and the later year is the build funding so we're expecting that to be in the next next financial year so is in this current financial year that we're in okay but okay so is there a gap of a year missing I'm just looking at the long-term plan and I can see 1.4 in 2122 um and I just would have expected there would be a design amount for 2021. I know there is funding at the moment in this current financial year in 2021 financial year to deliver that design element so yeah okay we're fine there okay right is there are there any other questions no in that case um do I have someone to move the recommendations there jimmy in secondary melanie any debate no uh I just wanted to say that I do think will those changes be made to keep in um all the reporting on all the different suburban areas yep yep something that's already been taking a night off to keep it cool uh in the case all in favor please say aye any against I'm glad that carrie thank you very much okay thank you very much team and now we move to the fiscal recreation and sports's away okay all right if you can give us um just a very quick run through and we'll open it up for questions um sorry swiss and as the brief indicated we're here to talk about the physical recreation and sports strategy um as previously identified and this strategy was looked at to be reviewed while looking at that process and we've deemed that in the current environment the recommendation is that the strategy remains in its current form and that we look to really focus on what's delivered against the strategy and through consolidating current initiatives and planning forming a unit specific action plan to that can be effectively communicated both internally and externally great uh questions uh jimmy question is that because these are the physical recreation sport strategy has been established launched in back to the 2002. over the last 19 years whether we have developer any other kind of action plan for the implementation or neighbor so now we thought that this strategy should be implemented then we consider develop this is my question and in the years that I've implementation plan that's been linked through and there's been work that's been achieved through other other means within council so three levels of service and through through other aspects through your activity management plans um through the that go up every ltp there'll be implementation done by that but this is a specific implementation plan developed now to continue on with that work I know my question is because we have a strategy strategic document but actually it's a main purpose for the implementation but this one over the last 19 years we never implement or we have implement but maybe you know it's affiliate with some other strategy or not I don't know I think on the question we can we can get the head of reckon sport to to come back with some details on that yani I i think that would be good like we've got a giraffe sports facilities plan that's been just kicking around for about 10 years we you know I was hoping we would have that in time for the 2015 ltp to inform haven't got it and basically if you look at this recreation and sports plan you know one of the things is it talks about um recreation support facilities built in open space are well utilized and needs are clearly prioritized so we've actually got that other piece of work happening but there's no kind of link between the two that I can see so I think it'd be really good to get an update on you know because I agree we don't need to reinvent the strategy there's actually quite the principles and the values in it are quite good but then it's got a whole bunch of actions that are just sort of going nowhere and there's no alignment to the other work that we're doing so how can we get alignment between the sports facilities plan the children's playground strategy in a timely way that informs our budgeting and gives effect to the strategy so in speaking with the planner involved in the um sports network plan uh she's indicated that um subject to resources that their back through to the committee before the end of the year so that body of work is separate to the body of work that we're presenting on today and but is indeed moving forward and going um and will be coming back through to committee but like what what's like what are we actually going to consult our key stakeholders on well it's engagement rather than consultation well sorry what are we going to collaborate with them on if it's not for like we're going to upgrade the sports park or we're going to build the sports facility so this this is talking about an implementation plan for this strategy you've got different layers underneath that then there's a network plan being done for the sports parks there's a network plan being done for playing wreck facilities they're all just parts of the jigsaw so this this implementation plan will come back for information here to this committee so you can have a look at exactly what he's saying council johansson as to how we're going to deliver I just check in does this mean that you're going to be engaging on some of the key priority areas to see if that still rings true with the community is that right so what we're looking to do is to consolidate the initiatives that are being completed by the by reckon sport unit and looking to bring that together with the planning that's been undertaken with the unit to identify what they're in to identify what's is being delivered against the strategic outcomes of the strategy and not only looking at the physical recreation and sports strategy but also looking at the other strategic documents across council and also the um documents externally that feed in through to the work that has done yeah and so that we are engaging to make sure that we're not duplicating what other organizations are doing and that what we do is complementary and not duplication and there's a significant amount in sport and rec that's done in partnership with the community agencies so sports agencies are private providers so it's about that collaboration so the intention is um and for an internal document that sits behind the strategy but that collaboration in that communication with those key stakeholders is vital and so that it brings it all together and is a city we go forward so who are the key stakeholders currently conversations have started with um sport canterbury the cdhb rso sport nz so it's looking at those organizations that also deliver and lead sport for the community right and how does this um compare to the spaces and places sports plan that sport canary did after the earthquake like the sports recovery plan and we'll reckon the wreck and sport unit have fed into their recent review of that document which occurred this year and so it's part of it so it's part of that conversation around ensuring that it's been indicated that work isn't duplicated but we haven't even seen that document like we weren't involved in that review at all it's not our document well the council's been very involved in it yeah just because we haven't seen yeah yeah okay and if you'd like a look I'm sure that it could be made available I just feel like we need to get a kind of presentation about all the stuff that's happening in sports and rec because basically we've got uh lcp budgets that we're sitting honey so you this facility you missed it this morning um we've got a series of updates coming from the various teams now that hasn't happened in the past so today we're starting with libraries in the art gallery we're going to have parks we're going to have brick and sport a series of updates on the work that each of those areas know I heard that I didn't miss it but this is quite different to just being told what's happening versus having some governance oversight of decision making and where the priorities are and so what I don't understand like for the budget for example we've got a whole bunch of stuff like a thing that's just we've heard just now that's that and we're going to be asked to set our budget so so everything that you fund is in the activity management plan so that's what activity management plans and ltp's are about so the strategies guide the work you know guide the direction but actually budgeting is done through the ltp and activity management right and you approve those and so if you go back to the sports facilities plan the idea was that we talk to the different codes we identify what the priorities are and then that feeds in we at a governance level we sign off on that that feeds into our budget right that's the whole point of us engaging with these stakeholders is to find out what the priorities are look at what the budgets can be allocated based on what what we agree so I guess what I'm concerned about is that this is all happening after our ltp and there's other work that's happening that we've just heard about today that could possibly be informing us so I think that that's not a that's here in front of us but that's something that you might like to raise in an informal um or part of the ltp process okay yeah and I think the key is that in looking at the old strategy and so it's old because it's 2002. and when you look at the the chart that was attached to the report you see how relevant it all still is and that's why the sense checking has gone on against sport canterbury in in sport new zealand so it's just a body of work that didn't need to be done but we can put our energies into getting a three-year implementation plan and getting it back to committee that's great thank you very much um do I have a mover for receiving that because it's also my concern we have a lot of different strategic document strategy you know however we didn't have a kind of budget support those action plan or implementation plan but this one would like to consider working together with the key stakeholders and also partner to but I'm still concerned you know for instance like a go-to in here particular emphasize all those sport in the activities they are made available to all citizens of christchurch and beyond if that's true no we still need to consider the geographic area or demographic area there's a total difference now you know we are diverse by the city and the community and the age the children or different ethical possibly you know and high possibly there are different requests different needs so this one you know it's urgent to establish one but also the long term plan I'm not sure long term drop for one we already put on the the body whether the time is sufficient or not so this is my my particular the the the the soon you know yeah thank you any for the debate no in the case I'll put that all in favor please say hi hello eddie against the baby thank you very much right now we move um to our first art gallery update welcome um thank you for coming in today um just comes to the types of feedback so take a note and we'll ask for feedback sort of offline later um on the types of things additional that you might like thank you sorry uh blue jackson director of christchurch art gallery and amy harrington my colleague who is the manager of our business services um uh thank you for the opportunity to update today I just thought we'd go quickly throughout some audience numbers some recent feedbacks from um surveys that we've been undertaking uh and I just thought I'd tell you a little bit about those surveys they're undertaken by a company uh called maurice hargrove's mcintyre who we work with the gallery team in front of amy's team gets the data from our visitors and and the process of collecting that data is continual but we get a quarterly report and this is a slight a combination of the last three quarters so uh visitors to the year to date um as of that figure but uh as of sunday um the past there was uh 2 300 and a 330 my strong point um of that what's interesting is that the gallery's um 22 down on where we'd be normally our normal targets um uh despite the pandemic and uh interesting that the average total around the the 100 uh main galleries of the world is that it's about 70 down and reductions at the moment the financial year to date we've seen about 8 420 school visits and that's approximately if we think we've got about 3 hundred booked in to the end of june but um what's important to note is that a hundred and thirty uh sorry one thousand three hundred seventy four students won't be able to participate in the program which um because a covert is less than the average which is two 300 per year that aren't able to be accommodated within the program um uh interesting the gallery was listed in the international art newspaper as the 99th most visited gallery in the world in the last year and christchurch art gallery was seen as one of the world's galleries least affected I think it was around 51. this just uh is a visitor origin breakdown and it just gives a little uh snapshot of where our visitors are coming from at the moment and normally around in the kind of pre-pandemic times the overseas tourists would be around 40 45 somewhere around there uh interesting uh the elsewhere in new zealand has has increased greatly uh here we go I'm sorry there we go uh there's some breakdown of some of the data that we collect uh I won't go through every line but you'll see that um in the top uh line is visitors agree that christchurch that the gallery is an important cultural institution within new zealand then 94 of our visitors agree and visitors also agree that the gallery contributes to the city um and abs adds to the optimism in the future of the city which is 88 uh and uh visitors agree that the gallery strengthens and enriches the canterbury community is uh 90 um and our overall satisfaction for visitors uh following a visit is 98 um I just thought I which is interesting that um uh 27 of our visitors include a purchase from the shop in that time and our current average sales transaction is 51 which is very good and interesting our shops doing incredibly well at this point in time uh this is um just a little snapshot about people's uh we ask people if uh they see that the um uh the gallery adds to their optimism about the future of christchurch and um you'll see that uh 88 um tend to agree or definitely agree something that we've been doing and something amy's really driven in the last little while is we've been surveying about well-being and it's something that we're um quite interested in knowing what the result of a visit to the art gallery is and this is uh statements that people believe has happened post their visit so they asked how they felt before and whether the gallery increased their sense of happiness or their sense of their day's been worthwhile or their satisfaction in the day and their uh connection in into the those kind of that data coming through and it's something that we're starting to collate over time um I thought I'd just do a little just a little walk through of some of our recent activities um this is a picture of a whole of a range of tours that we've been undertaking and for school children and it's a range of in-house and gallery tours but also uh more interestingly of late we've been working with our partners the uh turanga the botanical gardens the canterbury museum and developing tours that take children and their families uh through all of those uh institutions and sometimes the art center is also included the latest one is aututahi go wild you'll see a lot of children and families up and down the boulevard and completing that at the moment between each of those institutions on a much sadder night the gallery hosted the memorial service for uh one of new zealand's most important and certainly most loved local painters bill hammond was held earlier this year and uh yeah it's quite quite is an event that happened at the gallery one of our public programs in february it was called the big gig night and a range of local bands played all of the galleries were open there are a range of art activities as well and over the course of the night between uh six o'clock and eleven o'clock we had four thousand visitors through the gallery we've got another one planned uh coming up in august and um uh the big gig night that night will be hell's a popping the art of flying none and it will celebrate uh 40 years of the history of flying none and the artists that were involved the visual artists that were involved in that label and um it will tell a true kind of ototahi story and reposition flying none is very much a story that came from christchurch uh some of our exhibition programs of late have included the ralph haltery um a tt show that some of you may have attended the opening it was a significant event for the gallery and a really good example we worked with the dunedin public art gallery on that and that's proven to be enormously popular and we're noting a lot of travelers coming in from out of town to visit that show each year the gallery op offers a community group or a charity the free complimentary hire of our foyer space now this year we gave the space over to qtopia a group that is involved in the rainbow youth of christchurch and I just thought I'd just kind of finish on a quote from that from that group that we received following our event with them qtopia has been dreaming of a youth bull for years and the christchurch art gallery was truly our dream venue and for so many in our community young and old school bulls haven't been a place where we felt welcome or able to be ourselves and whether we were out we went out or we weren't allowed to wear the clothes we wanted or we weren't allowed to bring our partners we really wanted to create an opportunity for everybody who missed out to told us this is our first ball as me the gallery in your staff truly made it such a special night having 500 rainbow young people in such a significant and beautiful venue in the heart of the city gave recognition to a community that doesn't often doesn't feel included safe or welcome your team made everybody feel safe welcome and loved and that's such a special thing that's it so questions lovely um questions from people and good and thank you um thank you for the work that you're doing with um building those connections with the museum the art center I think it's terrific actually um I'm just wondering in terms of getting those school numbers visiting what are the apartment covered obviously what are the bear what normally are the barriers that stop school groups coming into the into the art gallery uh the the numbers that I i talk about that aren't able to come uh aren't I participator the students coming into wanting to participate uh in an in an activity uh designed by the gallery really a capacity issue okay right and school groups are they are they able to come in easily or do is cost of transport for example is that a problem for some schools it is but we work with a community group who offer assistance for low design schools that we we point schools low vsa schools to that fund fantastic yeah thank you jimmy we got into the sun figures the first one the four percentage visitor from the overseas so whether it is due to the coordinating pandemic or not but usually before the before uh coordinating pandemic kind of percentage 40 to 45 somewhere around there it kind of varies seasonally throughout the year yeah we're to expect it to be around 45 40 uh 40 it just it depends on cruise ship season skiing etc okay the other one is repeat a visit 68 percentage many is in christchurch or is a nationwide have any that would be mainly local visitors that are coming back yeah more than once during the year okay okay thank you and just one quick one for me are you the bands and things come in and play at lunch times no that's a program that was run through uh through uh events team at council and let's move to uh oh okay yeah I've got some photos of my kids there okay maybe you could run a competition I'm anne I can't just ask one more question just following on you talk about capacity issues blair is that space issues or staff issues resource it's it's staffing primarily yeah right yeah so if you have more staff you'll be able to run more programs always yeah of course okay cool thank you thank you yani yeah are you able to provide any more um breakdown of the schools where they're which schools are coming from which parts of the city uh we could we could certainly we would have that and data I could get that to you but um I don't have it on me but yes we we keep a record of what schools are coming do you have any general sense of um which schools are I think that we've been told that circulate the information would be really useful yeah that would be good um any further questions if not do I have someone move sam second or jimmy um thank you so much for coming along today good discussion good for an update so all those in favor please say aye okay and now for the like did you not hear me interrupting repeatedly okay thank you very much for coming along today um the first um sort of formal update this time um and I'll leave it up to you to go through it thank you very very much um council of templeton councillors um we really appreciate the opportunity we know you've had a long meeting and we're we're kind of the last guest for you but uh we're going to give you a little update and highlights I understand you've got the presentation uh which is great so you may have had a chance to have a look at it or can afterwards I'm going to I've got a number of my contribute to this and I'm going to kick off um with um kaiwakahara maori aurelia orona who's going to give you a little overview of both maori and multicultural initiatives aurelia has then got to she's got to go after she's spoken so our apologies for that but I think you'll really enjoy hearing from her so I'll hand over to aurelia to start with them actually I better move forward with good morning my name is aurelia um it's a privilege and a pleasure to be here um I'm the manager of maori services but actually within my team we have two work streams we have both maori and multicultural we have specialist staff who work in both work streams our kaitakawanga specialise in the design and delivery of kaupapa maori public programs delivered in te reo maori or english across all age ranges examples of current programs include a kohanga outreach program where we deliver early literacy programming in tereon maori ngapaki waitara a regular maori language story time session with attendees who come from across the city every week when they come to visit us is that I haven't bought those mattresses yet so they can't have a sleepover we're currently working on a collaboration with the university of canterbury in tupac or kaihoutu on a maori steam project and of course we're working on our regular upcoming matariki celebrations in june maori specialise in reference and research inquiries including whakapapa research information literacy in school-based visits around our collections recently we've been working with a lovely man trying to rediscover his whakapapa he had one name for us to work from when he came in over past months we've been able to find information and connect him back to his trust board in marai last friday he and his eighty-year-old grandmother flew to taranaki to be reunited with their whanau and hapu after generations away he said staff really took me under their wing showed a lot of patience and compassion it got rather emotional for me I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what a gift has been given to me and my whanau key partners whom we have lighting the archives team and the whakapapa unit the marilyn court te puni kokiri mata raka mahanui te tomo turunanga and theraki multi-agency collective impact project that's being scaled across the east at present our multicultural initiatives are aligned to the multicultural strategy in particular goals two and four the program and event focus and community liaison aspects of the multicultural liaison coordinator and the pacifica outreach roles enable us to work more effectively with our communities lunar new year celebrations were held in february we partnered with the confucius institute and ran after school programs bilingual story times and bedtime stories lilith also coordinated an event with 17 groups from the chinese and korean community participating and performing on the day culturally informed holiday programs are offered throughout the year and there is regular attendance at informed meetings partners partnering opportunities that we have worked on in the last financial year include the dia office of ethnic affairs the chinese cultural association of new zealand and the japanese consulate the pacifica outreach role is a new role to my team this role and an additional kaitakawanga role have relief fund and our fixed term until june 2022 the role has been operating for two months and already we are seeing improved connection with the wider pacifica community there has been involvement with ricketton high school parents pacifica night and the key highlight of the night according to the attendees was when they realised teresa understood for assam and could speak in language so there was genuine inclusion for them at the evening and being able to understand what our service offer is and how they might engage with that um polyfest we had a stall at this event with over 500 people visiting the stall it's really good for us to be out and visible in our communities where our communities can see us and the last group that I want to talk about is the matua group which provides a time and space for pacifica elders to come together while creating craft sessions are held at turanganui but the interesting thing with this program is that there's been an intergenerational evolution over time so now we have younger women coming to join in with elders enriching for all attendees and I guess the last thing I wanted to say was when we talk about resilience and we look at research across different sectors um it's clear education health that cultural identity and cultural connectiveness are key protective factors when it comes to resilience and strengthening communities and I know that my team and I are we're grateful and that we can serve our communities and our roles here thank you thank you very much thank you very much aurelia I really appreciate that we're going to just keep on going if you have questions that you'd like to to ask we're really happy to take those late and we can come back to you so thank you very very much for that so um handing over to rosie levy now rosie is stepping in for chris initially for chris haye as uh as uh touring a manager chris couldn't be here today he sends his apologies so she's going to initially give a little update on turanga in some of the programming and events and activities going on inclusion and some other and some other topics uh rosie's job her role is as one of the two community libraries managers so rosie thank you tala for everyone um we're a destination a place for people to access reference and lending collections we provide learning opportunities hands-on access to technology and other resources we offer spaces where our citizens can come together socially and for entertainment and the library is an appealing venue for partners to deliver the events last december the new zealand opera held a performance of eight songs for a mad king and that's the left-hand photo there on harpori outside the tsp space these types of events help drive up use of library collections and they give people one more reason to come to tularenga earlier this month we had a locally developed autonomous electric aircraft on display next to the cafe our book issues in our visitor numbers more than doubled over these two days so the events help grow the usage of wider library services and they bring people into town we continue to work with partners to make more of the open christchurch series we'll be hosting free engineering tours with the team who designed the season seismic systems behind the scene tours with librarians a children's cardboard city making workshop and architecture themed book displays and of course we can we will be again we will be a key venue partner for the word festival in august library teams are focused on doing everything we can to build on and reinforce the role of tuaranga as your centre of knowledge and exploration that is on behalf of chris a and now I'll be speaking about hornby so hornby is coming and um 2022 and we are at a stage where we are engaging with our community around programming and services we want to be able to hear from the local schools we want to be able to hear from community stakeholders about what they want to see in regards to these services so some of the library services that could be on offer include sewing machines um design um direct-to-garment technology so that's that whole technology where you can print straight onto a t-shirt um so that'd be great for that community 3d printers a laser cutter virtual reality esports a whole lot of different programs that we want to be able to offer out in this space so the engagement that we're looking to do is will be beginning and at the end of june so that's hornby update final update for me will be around digital inclusion so um we have two programs that I'm gonna speak about red we have partnership with rad who is a recycle device scheme and they are a scheme where used corporate laptops are refurbished by school students and in this case it's christchurch boys high school who refurbished these laptops and then they are placed into the hands of those who can't afford them and just some of the stories that we've been able to collect back has been around um a young mum who has three kids under five has received her laptop and she'll be studying um interior design um a direct quote from her is for the first time in years I am excited enable me to study which I haven't been able to do with my kids so far another young woman is exiting a abuse situation and she is using her laptop to study and make a new start and finally another young man disabled will be um using um his laptop to attend ara and start a computing course there the other initiative that we've been doing um in our libraries is working with skinny jump and this is giving access to our customers both um to subsidize broadband um and we have had to date 670 skinny sign ups and this particular team then would they were the highest jumpers in february and they won a morning tea so the highest signing of modems in the whole of new zealand so that's something to be proud of and also that the skinny jump was a very um popular um program that was taken up during the lockdown last year thanks for okay thank you yeah thank you very much rosie that's great I'm going to pass on now to erica rankin who's going to each um both erica and rosie have approximately half the libraries in our network have the community libraries each under their wing kia everyone it's lovely to be here today I'm just very briefly going to talk to you about a couple of things going on in my area this will be the sixth year that we've run the reading to dogs program it's incredibly popular and it's run at three of our libraries currently new brighton shirley and papanui we've built a great relationship with the animal management team to provide the service and the program's got a really successful profile um recently metropole magazine ran an article on um a book written by sue ellison on it was called friends and friends indeed it's about assistance dogs and this is what she said about what the program means to one of our young participants she said young juno's reading flourished when she joined the new brighton library's reading to dogs program because the dogs don't notice when I get a word wrong so that's obviously the's obviously gone to sleep um on the left and the photo on the right is sorry it's not a particularly good one but um that photo there is of a program running at arunui library at the moment for the two weeks of the school holidays we've recently been evaluating the sorts of programs that we're running at aranui some of our um more the ones that work everywhere else don't work so well at arunui and we've been trying really hard to hit the spot so some of these things that I'm going to tell you about are hitting the spot um this is a session here run by the creative trust so it's in we do this in partnership with the creative trust it's a drop-in session and we're finding that drop-ins work really really well I don't know either sessions where people ring up and book and just don't work it's it offers a number of digital technology activities for all ages stages and learning capabilities and it's been wonderful to see families that they've heard parents asking their kids to show them how to do some of the activities too so families working together is really wonderful one father was so engaged they said in one of these sessions that he was there with several children of different um older and younger the younger ones and the dad were so keen on what they were doing that they ignored the pleas of the older girls who wanted to go swimming next because they were so into what they were doing there and what they were learning initially as often happens I don't know when we run programming some of the children um weren't keen to to go in and participate they sit back and and watch but as soon as they saw what the ones who put themselves forward were doing they were really really keen and they all they all come in now and it's going really really well um staff said it's great to see the kids coming back also to challenge themselves to see if they can get up to the next level so're we're trying some different things other programming which is working really well at arunui uh involved drawing and music in particular and the use of garageband and the dj decks that we have in the libraries are you know really sort of going off as they say so hitting the spot so more work to be done in that space but really pleased with what we're doing there thank you thanks erica to pass on now to elaine uh elaine sides is our manager of content content collections for christchurch city libraries this is content in all its formats print print digital and everything in between so elaine's just going to give you a little update I'm going to focus on three areas of content canterbury stories the discovery wall and the library's website collecting the city's memory is an important function of the library in the digital space we've been supporting the implementation of the heritage strategy in three ways the ongoing digitization of fragile and popular material held in our archives collection adding material to canterbury stories our digital heritage own content and publish this in discovery wall canterbury stories was launched 15 months ago using open source technology since then we have added over 25 000 rare images and previously unpublished community and personal records and made these publicly accessible it is fast becoming a valuable portal to the past many photographs have come from city photographer doc ross the orion or the old med infrastructure archive the christchurch star archive and the library's own heritage collection among the rarities is the new zealand wheelman a very fragile publication on cycling in the 1890s and the samuel ensti collection of over 1200 glass plate negatives from the early 1900s using canterbury stories we've been able to create digital exhibitions including one to commemorate the earthquakes and to provide access to community contributed collections through our stories users can add comments to existing images and create their own sets of images to share publicly or privately using material held in the repository with local developers catalyst we are working towards enabling users to add their own content directly into canterbury stories meanwhile we will continue to describe as become available 24 7. photohunt provides a significant contribution to the discovery wall last year 21 of all our entries were uploaded directly into discovery wall this was a considerable increase on previous years where most in entries were sent in for staff to scan and upload the discovery wall holds over thirteen and a half thousand images and these can be interacted with at tauranga the mobile wall as it moves around the library network or through the discovery wall website engaging with the community has been enhanced through funding received from the government-based new zealand libraries partnership program and this has enabled us to employ someone temporarily in a community stories liaison role to encourage community groups or individuals to share their stories and in time support them to upload their material into canterbury stories independently this initiative has also given us the opportunity to identify gaps in our collection and proactively seek material to reflect the ever-increasing diversity in our communities the library's website is the gates away to all that we offer in libraries it gives us the ability to interact with the catalog by link large numbers of electronic databases we have to supplement our physical collections it also offers various predetermined searches created to assist users to find new titles and we have refreshed numerous booklets and genre guides to support that perennial question can you please recommend a good book in today's ever-changing circumstances it is more important than ever to provide communities with content relevant to their needs and to continue to offer choice let's see so that's the end of our presentation today I'm sorry sorry I'm very conscious of time madam chair uh you will you will thank you very much elaine uh for cutting in on you you will see pet street prepared a couple of slides on on program highlights uh you've got those in the presentation if you'd like me to talk to them so that's about the reading summer reading challenge particularly in children's university and esports I can either say something or you can look at that at your leisure just um just be guided by you yes uh the information is in your is've got access to uh yes sorry yes you haven't got it yes there are notes underneath was pretty much um the descriptions of it I see we we will make think you will make sure that you you get access yes I'll I'll liaise with aidan to do that sorry sorry about that um just just so that they are also very important initiatives that we've been doing but I'm aware that yeah we've taken a fair bit of your time um the discovery wall is there an ongoing cost associated with using that technology or where do you see it going I was just interested we have a um there is money that's put towards the platform fees for for it and so um the actual content we create ourselves but we have to pay for the platform that it's available through and is that sort of meeting the expectations still that we thought it would when we got it or I mean just from a general observation when I go and I don't see as many people using in um and I was also interested in what was happening with the community one right so start with the mobile more wall sorry goes um around the network so it spends a month at each different library so there's a structured program that goes there and so um we have staff um being able to show users how to how to use it it's also um as a way of promoting the discovery wall website which people can actually go in and add the material to um and so it is also then we can move material from discovery hall into canterbury stories as well as put new stuff into it as well so those two canterbury stories end and the discovery will interact um with each other so yeah councillor hanson we could provide some updated usage um if you would like yes that's right we haven't focused so much on the stats today but we can we can just we can add that to our notes and I guess just the other thing in terms of the discovery wall like it just seems engagement you've got this big wall where you could have amazing messages about what we're doing but it doesn't seem to ever be used to do stuff like that so I just wondered is there any opportunity to use the discovery wall and the smaller one for what we would call public service announcements or you know um community messaging to encourage people we're using I can see diane's elastic diane elaine's wanting to answer this as well where did that come from uh we're using our e-screens our digital screens throughout the libraries really more for that purpose whereas the discovery wall is primarily about surfacing making accessible our digital collections and content and those stories and images that the community wish to share with us there has been some really lovely stories of people finding a picture of someone in their family and then adding information about that picture who else is in there so it encourages engagement um and I can be standing there having looking and then the next thing carolyn's there doing the same thing and we um that engagement and um the whole story about oh I feel like do you remember this oh yes I do kind of thing um so that is happening um but I am also aware that sometimes you can come in there isn't a lot happening in tooranga but it's only one part of this it's just I'm getting increasing feedback from people because everything's going to the web now that they're not seeing stuff at either libraries or at council in terms of ongoing consultations and engagements so it'd be really interesting to see the ltp figures unfortunately library was closed during the consultation and we know that that area and you showed it with the digital inclusion information is one of the areas that where people struggle to get digital access so I was just really interested in what we can do to be more um create more visibility of the engagements that we're doing the impact on people through the libraries and I guess I just see it's a bit of a gap and could be maybe some that feedback that's really good I'll pick up on that so just remember for people if you flick through feedback on the types of content and the format and we did give that to our comm staff who were engaging on the ltp so it might be good to hear back from them what they did with libraries but certainly just from my general observation I didn't see the level that I would have hoped okay thank you very much so um thank you so much for coming in today um you're very welcome yeah yeah and keep up the good work and we'll um I'm gonna bring up the wheelman very shortly so thank you very much thank you thank you thanks everyone and we'll just um finish the meeting with anne anderson oh my mahitahi tattoo we must work together for the well-being of us all right and with that the meeting is closed thank you very much you

Okay thank you very much for coming along today um the first um sort of formal update this time um and I'll leave it up to you to go through it thank you very very much um council of templeton and councillors um we really appreciate the opportunity we know you've had a long meeting and we're we're kind of the last guest for you but uh we're going to give you a little update and highlights I understand you've got the presentation uh which is great so you may have had a chance to have a look at it or can afterwards I'm going to I've got a number of my team or our team here who are going to contribute to this and I'm going to kick off um with um kaiwakahara maori aurelia orona who's going to give you a little overview of both maori and multicultural initiatives aurelia has then got to uh she's got to go after she's spoken so our apologies for that um but I think you'll really enjoy hearing start with an actual better move forward and a pleasure to be here um I'm the manager of maori services but actually within my team we have two work streams we have both maori and multicultural we have specialist staff who work in both work streams our kaitakawanga specialise in the design and delivery of kaupapa maori public programs delivered in te reo maori or english across all age ranges examples of current programs include a kohanga outreach program where we deliver early literacy programming in tereon maori ngapaki waitara a regular maori language story time session with attendees who come from across the city every week our visits by the reehua ko matua group whose only complaint when they come to visit us is that I haven't bought those mattresses yet so they can't have a sleepover we're currently working on a collaboration with the university of canterbury in tupac hote on a maori steam project and of course we're working on our regular upcoming matariki celebrations in june reference and research inquiries including whakapapa research information literacy and school-based visits around our collections to rediscover his whakapapa he had one name for us to work from when he came in over the past months we've been able to find information and connect him back to his trust board in marai last friday he and his 80 year old grandmother flew to taranaki to be reunited with their whanau and hapu after generations away he said staff really took me under their wing showed a lot of patience and compassion it got rather emotional for me I just wanted to say how much I appreciate what a gift has been given to me and my whanau key partners whom we have worked alongside since july on various projects and initiatives include layton archives team in the whakapapa unit multi-agency collective impact project that's being scaled across the east at present our multicultural initiatives are aligned to the multicultural strategy in particular goals two and four the program and event focus and community liaison aspects of the multicultural liaison coordinator and the pacifica outreach roles enable us to work more effectively with our communities lunar new year celebrations were held in february we bilingual story times and bedtime stories lilith also coordinated an event with 17 groups from the chinese and korean community participating and performing on the day culturally informed holiday programs are offered throughout the year and there is regular attendance at informed meetings partners partnering opportunities that we have worked on in the last financial year include the dia office of ethnic affairs the chinese cultural association of new zealand and the japanese consulate the pacifica outreach role is a new role to my team this role and an additional kaitakawanga role have been funded by the new zealand libraries partnership program covert relief fund and our fixed term until june 2022 the role has been operating for two months and already we are seeing improved connection with the wider pacifica community there has been involvement with ricketton high school parents pacifica night um the key highlight of the night according to the attendees was when they realized teresa understood for assam and could speak in language so there was genuine inclusion for them at the evening and being able to understand what our service offer is and how they this event with over 500 people visiting the stall it's really good for us to be out and visible in our communities where our communities can see us and the last group that I want to talk about is the matua group which provides a time and space for pacifica elders to come together while creating craft um sessions are held at turanga aranui and south libraries but the interesting thing with this program is that there's been an intergenerational evolution over time so now we have younger women coming to join in with elders and it's just yeah it's enriching it's enriching for all attendees and I guess the last thing I wanted to say was when we talk about resilience and we look at research across different sectors um it's clear education health that cultural identity and cultural connectiveness are key protective factors when it comes to resilience and strengthening communities and I know that my team and I are we're grateful and that we can serve our communities and our roles here thank you thank you very much thank you to just keep on going if you have questions that you'd like to to ask for really happy to take those later and we can come back to you so uh thank you very very much for that so um handing over to rosie levy now rosie is stepping in for chris initially for chris haye as as uh turanga manager chris couldn't be here today he sends his apologies so she's going to initially give a little update on turanga and some of the programming and events and activities going on there and then she's going to talk about digital inclusion and some other and some other topics uh rosie's job her role is as one of the two community libraries managers so rosie thank you tala for everyone uh oh sorry yes lagging I'm lagging behind we're a destination a place for people to access reference and lending collections we provide learning opportunities hands-on access to technology and other resources we offer spaces where our citizens can come together socially and for entertainment and the library is an appealing venue for opera held a performance of eight songs for a mad king and that's the left-hand photo there on harpori outside the tsp space these types of events help drive up use of library collections and they give people one more reason to come to tularenga earlier this month we had a locally developed autonomous electric aircraft on display next to the cafe our book issues in our visitor numbers more than doubled over these two days so the events help grow the usage of wider library services and they bring people into town we continue to work with partners to make more of this happen coming up next month we're part of the open christchurch series we'll be hosting free engineering tours with the team who designed the season seismic systems behind the scene tours with librarians a children's cardboard study making workshop and architecture themed book displays and of course we can we will be again we will be a key venue partner for the word festival in august library teams are focused on doing everything we can to build on and reinforce the role is on behalf of chrissay and now I'll be speaking about hornby so hornby is coming in 2022 and we are at a stage where we are engaging with our community around programming and services um we want to be able to hear from the local schools we want to be here able to hear from community stakeholders about what they want to see in regards to these services so some of the library services that could be on offer include sewing machines design direct to garment technology so that's that whole technology where you can print straight onto a t-shirt or a pillowcase instead of the iron-on transverse um so that'd be great for that community 3d printers a laser cutter virtual reality esports a whole lot of different programs that we want to be able to offer out in this space so the engagement that we are looking to do is will be beginning and at the end of june so that's hornby update final update for me will be around digital inclusion so um we have two programs that I'm going to recycled device scheme and they uh are a scheme where used corporate laptops are refurbished by school students and in this case it's christchurch boys high school who refurbish these laptops and then they are placed into the hands of those who can't afford them and just some of the stories that we've been able to collect back has been around a young mum who has three kids under five has received her laptop and she'll be studying interior design um a direct quote from here is for the first time in years I am excited about what this year will bring and this laptop will enable me to study which I haven't been able to do with my kids so far another young woman is exiting a abuse situation and she is using her laptop to study um and make a new start and finally another young man disabled will be using his laptop to attend ara and start a computing course there the other initiative that we've been doing and in our libraries is working with skinny jump and this is giving have had to date 670 skinny sign ups and this particular team then would they were the highest jumpers in february and they won a morning tea so the highest signing of modems in the whole of new zealand so that's something to be proud of and also that the skinny jump was a very um popular um program that was taken up during the lockdown last year thanks for okay thank you yeah thank you very much rosie that's great I'm going to pass on now to erica rankin who's going to continue erica is the other community libraries managers so each each um both erica and rosie uh have approximately half the libraries in our network have the community libraries each under their wing kia ora everyone it's lovely to be here today um I'm just very briefly going to talk to you about a couple of things going on in my area this will be the sixth year that we've run the reading to dogs program it's incredibly popular and it's run at three of our libraries currently relationship with the animal management team to provide the service and the program's got a really successful profile recently metropole magazine ran an article on a book written by sue allison on it was called friends and friends indeed it's about assistance dogs and this is what she said about what the program means to one of our young participants she said young juno's reading flourished when she joined the new brighton library's reading to dogs program because the dogs don't notice when I get a word wrong so that's obviously the picture with the dog who's so relaxed he's obviously gone to sleep um on the left and the photo on the right is sorry it's not a particularly good one but um that photo there is of a program running at arunui library at the moment for the two weeks of the school holidays we've recently been evaluating the sorts of programs that we're running at arunui some of our um more the ones that work everywhere else don't work so well at I don't the spot so some of these things that I'm going to tell you about are hitting the spot um this is a session here run by the creative trust so it's in we do this in partnership with the creative trust it's a drop-in session and we're finding that drop-ins work really really well I don't know either um sessions where people ring up and book and just don't work it's it offers a number of digital technology activities for all ages stages and learning capabilities and it's been wonderful to see families interacting with each other over these activities the staff say that they've heard parents asking their kids to show them how to do some of the activities too so families working together is really wonderful one father was so engaged they said in one of these sessions that he was there with several children of different um older and younger the younger ones and the dad were so keen on what they were doing that they ignored the pleas of the older girls who wanted to go swimming there and what they were learning initially as often happens I don't know when we run programming some of the children um weren't keen to to go in and participate they sit back and and watch but as soon as they saw what the ones who put themselves forward were doing they were really really keen and they all they all come in now and it's going really really well um staff said it's great to see the kids coming back also to challenge themselves to see if they can get up to the next level so and other programs we've found as I said we're we're trying some different things other programming which is working really well at arunui uh involved drawing and music in particular and the use of garageband and the dj decks that we have in the libraries are you know really sort of going off as they say so hitting the spot so more work to be done in that space but really pleased with what we're doing there thank you thanks erica to pass on now content collections for christchurch city libraries this is content in all its formats print print digital and everything in between so elaine's just going to give you a little update I'm going to focus on three areas of content canterbury stories the discovery wall and the library's website collecting the city's memory is an important function of the library and the digital space we've been supporting the implementation of the heritage strategy in three ways the ongoing digitization of fragile and popular material held in our archives collection adding material to canterbury stories our digital heritage repository and providing users with the opportunity to create their own content and publish this in discovery wall canterbury stories was launched 15 months ago using open source technology since then we have added over 25 000 rare images and previously unpublished community and personal records and made these publicly accessible it is fast becoming a valuable portal to the past many photographs have come from city photographer doc ross the orion or the old med infrastructure archive the christchurch star archive and the library's own heritage collection fragile publication on cycling in the 1890s and the samuel ensd collection of over 1200 glass plate negatives from the early 1900s using canterbury stories we've been able to create digital exhibitions including one to commemorate the earthquakes and to provide access to community contributed collections through our stories users can add comments to existing images and create their own sets of images to share publicly or privately using material held in the repository with local developers catalyst we are working towards enabling users to add their own content directly into canterbury stories meanwhile we will continue to describe as much materials as possible so that those previously hidden treasures become available 24 7. photohunt provides a significant contribution to the discovery wall last year 21 of all our entries were uploaded directly into discovery wall this was a considerable increase on previous years where most entries were sent in for staff to scan and upload the discovery wall holds over thirteen and a half thousand images and these can be interacted with at tauranga the mobile wall as it moves around the library network or through the discovery funding received from the government-based new zealand libraries partnership program and this has enabled us to employ someone temporarily in a community stories liaison role to encourage community groups or individuals to share their stories and in time support them to upload their material into canterbury stories independently this initiative has also given us the opportunity to identify gaps in our collection and proactively seek material to reflect the ever-increasing diversity in our communities the

of electronic databases we have to supplement our physical collections it also offers various predetermined searches created to assist users to find new titles and we have refreshed numerous booklets and genre guides to support that perennial question can you please recommend a good book in today's ever-changing circumstances that is more important than ever to provide communities with content relevant to their needs and to continue to offer choice that's yeah so that's the'm very conscious of time madam chair uh you will you will thank you very much elaine for cutting in on you you will see pet street prepared a couple of slides on on program highlights you've got those in the presentation if you'd like me to talk to them so that's about the reading summer reading challenge particularly in children's university and esports I can either say something or you can look at that at your leisure just um just be guided by you yes uh the information that information is in your is in your powerpoint in the presentation that I understand you've got access to uh yes sorry yes you haven't got it yes there are notes underneath with pretty much um the descriptions of it I see we we will make think you will make sure that you you get access yes I'll I'll liaise with aidan to do that sorry sorry about that um just just so that they are also very important um initiatives that we've been doing but I'm aware that yeah we discovery wall is there an ongoing cost associated with using that technology or where do you see it going I was just interested we have a um there is money that's put towards the platform fees for for it and so um the actual content we create ourselves but we have to pay for the platform that it's available through and is it sort of meeting the expectations still that we thought it would when we got it or I mean just from a general observation when I go and I don't see as many people using it as as I saw when it first got put in um and I was also interested in what was happening with the community one right so start with the mobile more wall yeah sorry goes um around the network so it spends a month at each different library so there's a structured program that goes there and so we we have staff being able to show users how to how to use it it's also as a way of promoting the discovery wall website which people can so it is also then we can move material from discovery wall into canterbury stories as well as put new stuff into it as well so those two canterbury stories end and the discovery will interact um with each other so yeah councillor hanson we could provide some updated usage um and I guess just the other thing in terms of the discovery wall like it just seems to me such a shame we're doing an ltp engagement you've got this big wall where you could have amazing messages about what we're doing but it doesn't seem to ever be used to do stuff like that so I just wondered is there any opportunity to use the discovery wall and the smaller one for what we would call public service announcements or you know um community messaging to encourage people we're using I can see diane's elastic diane elaine's wanting to answer this as well where did that come from we're using our e-screens our digital screens throughout the libraries really more for that purpose whereas the discovery wall is primarily about those stories and images that the community wish to share with us there has been some really lovely stories of people finding a picture of someone in their family and then adding information about that picture who else is in there so it encourages engagement and I can be standing there having looking and then the next thing carolyn's there doing the same thing and we're looking at the same thing so there is that um that engagement and um the whole story about oh I feel like do you remember this oh yes I do kind of thing um so that is happening um but I am also aware that sometimes you can come in there isn't a lot happening in touranga but it's only one part of this it's just I'm getting increasing feedback from people because everything's going to the web now that they're not seeing stuff at either libraries or at council in terms of ongoing consultations and engagements so it'd be really interesting to see the ltp figures unfortunately library was closed during the consultation and the digital inclusion information is one of the areas that where people struggle to get digital access so I was just really interested in what we can do to be more um create more visibility of the engagements that we're doing that impact on people through the libraries and I guess I just see it's a bit of a gap and could be maybe some information on that in the next report thank you for that feedback that's really good pick up on that so just remember for people if you um flick through feedback on the types of content in the format and we did give that to our comm staff who were engaging on the ltp so it might be good to hear back from them what they did with libraries but certainly just from my general observation I didn't see the level that I would have hoped okay thank you very much so um thank you so much for coming in today um thank you very welcome to yeah yeah and um keep up the good work and we'll um I'm you very much thank you thank you thanks everyone and we'll just um finish the meeting with anne and karakia now my mahitahi tattoo moto oranga or takata
So apologies today we have apologies for lateness from oh jake's here so I'll take you off melanie coca um and catherine chu this apology for lateness and sam you may be only if we're not finished by midday but I'm sure be um all right three hours to move some minutes strange things have happened um she's just messaged me and said lateness so I don't know we'll leave it for lateness now and if she doesn't arrive we can change it sets okay is it yeah I'm in early departure well I think we'll be done we've only got the three waters thanks phil so are you moving the apologies then okay I think you seconded aaron all those in favor say aye against that's carried over do you want that noted the troublemaker's on right sarah and leanne yeah okay so
Right now we move um to our first art gallery update welcome um uh thank you for coming in today um just as a quick note um to counselors and when it comes to the types of feedback so take a note and we'll ask for feedback sort of offline later um on the types of things additional that you might like thank you sorry uh blue jackson director of christchurch gallery and amy harrington my colleague who is the manager of our business services um uh thank you for the opportunity to update you today I just thought we'd go quickly throughout some audience numbers some recent feedbacks from um surveys that we've been undertaking uh and I just thought I'd tell you a little bit about those surveys they're undertaken by a company uh called morris hargreaves mcintyre who we work with the gallery team in front of amy's team gets the data from our visitors and and the process of collecting that data is continual but we get a quarterly report and this is a slight combination of the last three of that figure but as of sunday um the past it was uh 2 hundred and two thousand three hundred thirty uh sorry two hundred thirty three thousand and fifty nine yeah uh mass is never my strong point um uh of that uh what's interesting is that the gallery's um 22 down on where we'd be normally our normal targets um uh despite the pandemic and uh interesting that the average total around the the 100 uh main galleries of the world is that it's about 70 down and reductions at the moment the financial year to date we've seen about 8 420 school visits and that's approximately if we think we've got about 3 thousand one hundred booked in to the end of june but um what's important to note is that a hundred and thirty uh sorry one thousand three hundred and seventy four students won't be able to participate in the program which um because a covert is less than the average which is 2 300 per year that aren't able to be accommodated within the international art newspaper as the 99th most visited gallery in the world in the last year and christchurch art gallery was seen as one of the world's galleries least affected by covered with we had the least closed days and I think it was around 51. uh this just uh is a visitor origin breakdown and it just gives a little uh snapshot of where our visitors are coming from at the moment and normally around in the kind of pre-pandemic times the overseas tourists would be around uh 40 45 somewhere around there uh interesting uh the elsewhere in new zealand is uh has increased greatly uh here we go I'm sorry come on here we go uh there's some breakdown of some of the data that we collect uh I won't go through every line but you'll see that um in the top uh line is visitors agree that christchurch uh that the gallery is an important cultural institution within new zealand then 94 of our visitors agree and visitors also agree that the gallery contributes to the city and abs adds to uh 88 percent uh and uh visitors agree that the gallery strengthens and enriches the canterbury community is uh 90 um and our overall satisfaction for visitors uh following a visit is 98 um I just thought I'd go through a couple of the other ones too which is interesting that um uh 27 of our visitors include a purchase from the shop in that time and our current average sales transaction is 51 which is very good and interesting our shops doing incredibly well at this point in time this is uh just a little snapshot about people's uh we ask people if uh they see that the um uh the gallery adds to their optimism about the future of christchurch and um you'll see that uh 88 um tend to agree or definitely agree something that we've been doing uh and uh something amy's really driven in the last little while is we've been surveying about well-being and it's something that we're um quite interested in knowing what the result of a visit to the art gallery is and this visit so they asked how they felt before and whether the gallery increased their sense of happiness or their sense of their day's been worthwhile or their satisfaction in the day and their uh connection in into the world and uh it's um it's great to see those kind of that data coming through and it's something that we're starting to collate over time um I thought I'd just do a little just a little walk through of some of our recent activities this is a picture of a whole of a range of tours that we've been undertaking and for school children and it's a range of in-house and gallery tours but also more interestingly of late we've been working with our partners the turanga the botanical gardens the canterbury museum and developing tours that take children and their families uh through all of those uh institutions and sometimes the art center is also included the latest one is ultatahi go wild you'll see a lot of children and families up and down the boulevard and completing that at much sadder night the gallery hosted the memorial service for uh one of new zealand's most important and certainly most loved local painters bill hammond was held earlier this year and it's quite quite a moment some of you may have been there this is an event that happened at the gallery one of our public programs in february it was called the big gig night and a range of local bands played all of the galleries were open there are a range of art activities as well and over the course of the night between uh six o'clock and eleven o'clock we had four thousand visitors through the gallery we've got another one planned coming up in august and um the big gig night that night will be helzer popping the art of flying none and it will celebrate uh 40 years of the history of flying none and the artists that were involved the visual artists that were involved in that label and it will tell a true kind of ototahi story and reposition flying none is very much a story that came have included the ralph haltery show that some of you may have attended the opening it was a significant event for the gallery and a really good example of a partnership model of an exhibition developed development and we worked with the dunedin public art gallery on that and that's proven to be enormously popular and we're noting a lot of travelers coming in from out of town to visit that show each year the gallery op offers a community group or a charity the free complimentary hire of our four-year space now this year we gave the space over to qtopia a group that is involved in the rainbow youth of christchurch and I just thought I just kind of finished on a quote from that from that group that we received following our event with them utopia has been dreaming of a youth bull for years and the christchurch art gallery was truly our dream venue and for so many in our community young and old school balls haven't been a place where we felt welcome or able to be ourselves and whether we were wear the clothes we wanted or we weren't allowed to bring our partners we really wanted to create an opportunity for everybody who missed out to have their ball moment and for so many told us this is our first ball as me the gallery in your staff truly made it such a special night having 500 rainbow young people in such a significant and beautiful venue in the heart of the city gave recognition to a community that doesn't often doesn't feel included safe or welcome your team made everybody feel safe welcome and loved and that's such a special thing that's it so questions lovely um questions from people and thank you um thank you for the work that you're doing with building those connections with the museum the art centre I think it's terrific actually I'm just wondering in terms of getting those school numbers visiting what are the apartment covered obviously what are the bear what normally are the barriers that stop school groups coming into the into the art gallery uh the the numbers that I I't I participator the students coming into wanting to participate uh in an in an activity uh designed by the gallery staff and delivered by the gallery staff so it's really a capacity issue okay right and school groups are they are they able to come in easily or do is cost of transport for example is that a problem for some schools it is but we work with a community group um who offer assistance for low design schools that we we point uh schools lower si schools to that fund fantastic yeah thank you jimmy we got into some figures the first one the four percentage visit from the overseas so whether it is uh due to the coordinating pandemic or not but usually before the before uh coordinating pandemic kind of percentage 40 to 45 percent somewhere around there it kind of varies seasonally throughout the year yeah we're to expect it to be around 45 40 uh 40 it just it depends on cruise ship seasons skiing etc okay the other one is repeat of visitor 68 percentage many is in christchurch or is that are coming back more than once during the year okay okay thank you and just one quick one for me are you still running the um the program with the school children the bands and things come in and play at lunch times uh no that's a program that was run through uh through uh events team at council and it's moved to uh oh okay yeah that's a little bit yeah for a while yeah yeah got some photos of my kids there okay maybe you could run a competition I'm I'm trying to ask one more question just following on you talk about capacity issues blair is that space issues or staff issues resource it's it's staffing primarily really yeah right yeah so if you had more staff you'll be able to run more programs always yeah of course okay cool thank you thank you yani yeah are you able to provide any more um breakdown of the schools where they're which schools are coming from which parts of the city uh we could we could certainly we but um I don't have it on me but yes we we keep a record of what what schools are coming do you have any general sense of um which schools are coming and which ones aren't no I wouldn't I think that we've been told that circulate the information would be really useful yeah that would be good um any further questions if not do I have someone move sam second or jimmy um thank you so much for coming along today good discussion good for an update um so all those in favor please say hi debate what are you gonna do yeah oh just kidding sorry I didn't see you in time job that they've done they actually have done a really good job okay and now for the lighting
Um can we go back to the minutes for the audit and risk management committee move by sam seconded by sarah I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried audit new zealand management report 2019-20 move by sam seconded by james I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried health cell health safety and wellbeing committee minutes take it take it as red happy to move james has moved them any questions I'm sorry any a seconder please sam mcdonald I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the
Okay thank you very much team and now we move to the fiscal recreation and sports strategy update welcome elizabeth good is nigel here no he's away okay that's good all right if you can give us um just a very quick run through and we'll open it up for questions um sorry swiss um as the brief indicated we're here to talk about the physical recreation and sports strategy as previously identified and this strategy was looked at to be reviewed while looking at that process and we've deemed that in the current environment the recommendation is that the strategy remains in its current form and that we look to really focus on what's delivered against the strategy and through consolidating current initiatives and planning forming a unit-specific action plan to that can be effectively communicated both internally and externally great questions jimmy question is because these are the physical recreation sport strategy has been established launched in back to the 2002. over the last 19 years whether we have developed any other kind of action plan for the implementation or neighbor so we consider develop this is my question um in the years that I've been at council I'm not aware of a specific implementation plan that's been linked through and there's been work that's been achieved through other other means within council so three levels of service and through through other aspects through your activity management plans through the that go up every ltp there'll be implementation done by that but this is a specific implementation plan developed now to continue on with that work I know my question is because we have a strategy strategic document but actually the main purpose for the implementation but this one over the last 19 years we never implement or we have implement but maybe you know it's affiliate with some other strategy or not I don't know I think on that question we can we can get the head of recon sport to to come back with some details on that yani I think that would be good like we've got a giraffe sports facilities plan that's been just kicking around for about have that in time for the 2015 ltp to inform where we were spending money on sports facilities but we haven't got it and basically if you look at this recreation and sports plan you know one of the things is it talks about um recreation sport facilities built in open space are well utilized and needs are clearly prioritized so we've actually got that other piece of work happening but there's no kind of link between the two that I can see so I think it'd be really good to get an update on you know because I agree we don't need to reinvent the strategy there's actually quite the principles and the values in it are quite good but then it's got a whole bunch of actions that are just sort of going nowhere and there's no alignment to the other work that we're doing so how can we get alignment between the sports facilities plan the children's playground strategy in a timely way that informs our budgeting and gives effect to the strategy so in speaking with's indicated that um subject to resources that their draft will be with a drug plan will be presented back through to the committee before the end of the year so that that body of work is separate to the body of work that we're presenting on today and but is indeed moving forward and going um and will be coming back through to committee but like what what's like what are we actually going to consult our key stakeholders on well it's engagement rather than consultation well sorry what are we going to collaborate with them on if it's not for like we're going to upgrade the sports park or we're going to build the sports facility so this this is talking about an implementation plan for this strategy you've got different layers underneath that there's a network plan being done for the sports parks there's a network plan being done for playing wreck facilities they're all just parts of the jigsaw so this this implementation plan will come back for information here to this committee so you can johansson as to how we're going to deliver on the different aspects of the strategy so so can I just check in does this mean that you're going to be engaging on some of the key priority areas to see if that still rings true with the community is that right uh so what we're looking to do is to consolidate the initiatives that are being completed by the by rec and sport unit and looking to bring that together with the planning that's been undertaken with the unit to identify um what they're in to identify what is being delivered against the strategic outcomes of this strategy and not only looking at the physical recreation and sports strategy but also looking at the other strategic documents across council and also the documents externally that uh feed in through to the work that is done yeah and so that we are engaging to make sure that we're not duplicating what other organizations are doing and what we do is um complementary and not duplication and there's a significant amount in sport and wreck sports agencies are private providers so it's about that collaboration that they can get by working together with those people so the intention is um and for an internal document that sits behind the strategy but that collaboration in that uh communication with those key stakeholders is vital and so that it brings it all together and as a city we go forward so who are the key stakeholders uh currently conversations have started with um sport canterbury the cdhb rso sporting seed so it's looking at those organizations they also deliver and lead sport for the community right and how does this um compare to the spaces and places sports plan that sport can we did after the earthquake like the sports recovery plan and we'll uh reckon the wreck and sport unit have fed into their recent review of that document which occurred this year and so it's part of it so it's part of that conversation around ensuring that it's um been indicated that work isn't duplicated but we haven't even seen that document like we weren't involved well council's been very involved in it yeah just because we haven't seen it as a council so you guys have seen it yeah yeah okay and if you'd like a look I'm sure that it could be made available I just feel like we need to get a kind of presentation about all the stuff that's happening in sports and rec because basically we've got lcp budgets that we're sitting honey so you this facility you missed it this morning um we've got a series of updates coming from the various teams now that hasn't happened in the past so today we're starting with libraries in the art gallery we're going to have parks we're going to have rick and sport a series of updates on the work that each of those areas you know I heard that I didn't miss it but this is quite different to just being told what's happening versus having some governance oversight of decision making and where the priorities are and so what I don't understand like for of stuff like a thing that's just we've heard just now that's been reviewed but we don't have any sense of that and we're going to be asked to set our budget so so everything that you fund is in the activity management plan so it's what activity management plans and ltp's are about so the strategies guide the work you know guide the direction but actually budgeting is done through the ltp and activity management right and you approve those and so if you go back to the sports facilities plan the idea was that we talk to the different codes we identify what the priorities are and then that feeds in we're at a governance level we sign off on that that feeds into our budget right that's the whole point of us engaging with these stakeholders is to find out what the priorities are look at what the budgets can be allocated based on what what we agree so I guess what I'm concerned about is that this is all happening after our ltp and there's about today that could possibly be informing us so I think that that's not a conversation that can be dealt with in this particular report that's here in front of us but there's something that you might like to raise in an informal um or part of the ltp process okay yeah and I think the key is that in looking at the old strategy and so it's all because it's 2002 and when you look at the chart that was attached to the report you see how relevant it all still is and that's why the sense checking has gone on against sport canterbury in in sport new zealand so it's just a body of work that didn't need to be done but we can put our energies into getting a three-year implementation plan and getting it back to committee that's great thank you very much um do I have a mover for receiving that um second note jimmy not many debates jimmy because it's also my concern we have a lot of different strategic document strategy you know those action plan or implementation plan but this one would like to consider working together with the key stakeholders and also partner to establish one that's pretty good that's very good but I'm still concerned you know for instance like a go-to in here particular emphasize all those sports and the activities they are made available to all citizens of christchurch and beyond if that's true you know we still need to consider the geographic area or demographic area there's a total uh difference now you know we are diverse by the city and the community and the age the children or different ethical possibly you know and high possibly there are different requests different needs so this one you know it's urgent to establish one but also the long-term plan I'm not sure long term drop for one week already on the the party whether the time is sufficient or not so this is my my particular the the the concern you know yeah any for further debate no in that case I'll put that all in favor please say hi we move um
Move to dorset street flats paper tin all right um and it just gives a quick summary and then we'll move to questions yeah so I think commander's here um for this one um this is the the miles warren designed uh series of apartments at dorset street um pretty groundbreaking for its time and very much a nationally and internationally recognized piece of architecture which has been severely damaged in the earthquakes but the owners have clubbed together which is um quite difficult when you imagine you've got eight different owners here that they all have to resolve their own insurance issues and come together and decide to repair the building or not and in this case they've obviously decided to to do that so um it's it should be a good outcome the repair work has has started because they've had to proceed with some of the um some of the the work um to get on with it so um it's uh um it's a show that they've got faith in in the in the outcome of the um brendan sam yeah thank you no I've probably missed it in the report but are they currently occupied oh no so they haven't been used since the earthquakes no they're significantly damaged so they've had to they've had to move out right okay so they haven't been used since earthquakes no but they have been secured that's the important thing they were they were bike stock plywood and what's the intention so they get repaired are they going to be owner occupied again or will they be yeah so that'll all be either octagoid yes yeah okay so they're going to sell some because it's got a few of them own a couple of flats each um I think some of them some of them own two two flats yeah it's all that the model actually was was uh the initial model was to to have an owner who leased out another flat so that was the the initial design model by mars warren that they they knew that they could they could see sort of self-support so that was the model now I know things have moved on since then but um although other people do own yes there are a couple of owners who own a couple of of the units yeah but they're they have to work together to to fix them anyway because you're sorry we may not understand you're explaining it really well but the so the people that own them now are they going to go and live in them after well um um I don't have that information so some of them will be over occupied I think some will continue to be rented out right yeah well the important thing is they will be fixed yeah there are some owners who own multiple flats and that that's been a mechanism to help save the buildings because some of the owners have had to sell due to local finances okay thank you thanks pauline yes the total cost of conservation works it's a tricky one because the the the code at the time when these were built back in the 1950s early 60s they small units so the the logical way that you would you would insulate these would be to strap and line them internally now that would do two things one it would reduce the size of the the unit but also it would cover over the the fabric and it's that exposure of the construction fabric which is important so yes in some degrees that they're going to have to accept that these are always going to be uninsulated buildings because if you do try and insulate them you can insulate the roof you can insulate the elements where you can hide the insulation but to insulate the walls would be to hide the the original heritage fabric luckily the other the other positive thing is because the party walls um they're like terraced houses they don't they don't lose heat as much because they've got a party wall as opposed to the end wall double glazing that's a that's a bit of a tricky one because double glazing does mean you have to change the original um yeah um I think where heritage values then then we we would encourage people to do that but obviously if there's if there's existing windows and they're perfectly fine then then it's it doesn't make sense to pull them out just to won't there be a time when this sort of building will be uninhabitable because it won't um comply with the health standards my house is 1870 so I'm still living in it um I think I think you you you adjust and you make you make um provision for it yes you may have but we can't hear and the thing is this is council money that we're having being asked to put into it I mean I fully support it but I'm just concerned that with this it's an old cold and our moral duty to actually be yes it's more than building code because if some of it's going to be rentals there's rental standards and those kind of things for insulation and healthy homes but that's for the landlord to um it's landlords rental standards but um but insulation and double glazing are building code requirements so I'm assuming that the project manager and the owners have sought advice from council around um around what they require to do to to comply with building code um I'm the I guess that what we've got before you today is around the heritage fabric um and I think that your question around the future um I've it's useful to reflect how technology is catching up on insulation and what you can achieve so what might be possible in the future for these buildings to meet building code and still be heritage buildings or still retain the heritage fabric um any further questions sorry jake then phil linton a quick one um what would be the consequence of not funding these today the works already happening would work stop would work be reduced what would be the consequence hmm um they would they would struggle to complete the work yes um they've they've had to settle with their insurance companies there is there is a gap there is a gap um ways to to bridge the gap sorry so it it would potentially I mean I can't speak for the individual owners but um it certainly could jeopardize the work but we don't know the individual finances of each owner we're judging it on the merits of the heritage values that are being retained thanks um did you want to yell at as you go just one myself well it has high heritage values so that that's that's they have faith in it as well okay thank you um so there are eight of them and is it the two are connected and so there's a kind of separate so I'm just wondering if it's heritage value that we're after do we need to support all eight or as a for after heritage value to protect then you know the two units I think I think although this there are two there are two separate blocks there they are very much linked there if you if you lose one it's it's it will lose a lot of the units for I mean they're they were bachelor bachelor pads it's kind of slightly two different things though aren't they because one is we debating here about the heritage value of a building or buildings but the other one is the social value of what they were trying to achieve back then so there are two different things here but the fund is about the architectural fabric of the building yeah but but there are it would be difficult to decide for example which of the four you would keep you would then be telling four owners that you're not getting funding you are how would you do that they do have they have value as they are now they've they've actually um survived for 50 years without huge alteration um they they are a a an entity you know to to to lose half of it would be a significant loss and undermine their issues you'd reduce the architectural values quite quite a lot okay yeah yeah I know that there does seem to be some repetition in them but that's eight units pretty much the same with with modifications made on the on the basis of uh what the owners were able to do or wanted to do with them so yeah I think it would be it would undermine the heritage values of the of the the the item to lose half of it they are listed as one item thank you green if I just check the um the amount that's recommended um while it's just at a certain percentage of the works proposed uh per unit it's quite a bit higher than we would normally do for um dwellings of this um indep of each individual size I was wondering if you've got any comments on that so it may be twice as high as um individual dwellings of that size that we've done in the past yeah well the individual unit is is works out forty five thousand dollars per unit um I i didn't I that didn't strike me as being a large amount we actually would really reduce the percentage you see the percentage has gone down than that but that seemed to be um an appropriate figure um other comparisons we did where funding was um um it is difficult to do comparisons with different types of building because we're dealing with with a modernist concrete block building here as opposed to timber frame building um and also the the need to to have cross-party uh cooperation in order to strengthen walls for example the our party walls so it seemed the figure was arrived at on the basis of one what all of the criteria that we use but but amongst them is obviously the heritage value of the building what the owners can contribute but also what funding is available and the total funding at 360 000 seemed to be the right the right area it gives a a reasonably significant amount of support to individual owners but not not excessive so can I just clarify though if there had been less funding available before the end of the financial year you would have been happy to recommend less well we have to we have to bear in mind what funds we have figure um and and the figure is either uh is based on a percentage or or or a more um nominal figure to to show support for something of of of this kind of um of this kind of work so um I mean we've particularly had in mind the fact that it's in 183 thousand gap for each flat between the um insurance payout and the actual costs of the heritage works um so it's a it is a significant gap um which that that uh 25 will go towards helping and we referred back to other um buildings such as the the duncan's buildings which was a a row of buildings in high street that we made a contributing contribution to yeah and they've got 45 000 each as well so that I mean that's a a comparable grant some and and you can remember as well we're excluding those elements where the owners have chosen to upgrade things like kitchens that you know they're not they're not heritage so these this is the this is the the bones are having to invest further sums themselves if they want to to increase the the the level of immunity in the in the unit thanks um mike thanks the funding gap because of the insurance is because the the owners are choosing to um upgrade it from 34 which they got um settled for up to 67 years that's a I guess that's a choice of them to do it is a choice but but it gives them that resilience to to the if the code changes slightly you won't get caught and become an earthquake-prone building sam sorry just one last quick one it's just to follow what I was saying before so do we have a sense of the intention of these buildings once they are appeared I'm just not I can't I can't find out here are they going to be built and then on sold are they going to be built rented out are they going to be built or are they all being moved into by the owners have you talked through that in your discussions with them I guess the important thing for us is that they'll continue to be used for residential purposes as they were originally built um the important thing for us is that they'll continue to be used for residential purposes so that's that that's been our main concern they have a history of being owner-occupied or rented out as far as I know that's going to continue okay james look what councilman major said I'm I feel similarly um however I recognize that there are heritage values but how many of these do we have on our books of this this um of this sort of nature because you know I i know those flats I used to party in them but um but you know where is it well we can what we're looking at is the heritage values the these are these are the first the first of their type they're the prototype designed by one of the books sorry when I say on our books on our on our as a response register that's a word yeah well they're we don't have anything else we don't have anything else like these on on the schedule in the district plan um in terms of modernist post-war buildings um we have a handful okay the town hall um samoas warren's office in flat and cambridge terrace is similar but this you know this building's of new zealand architectural significance in terms of the story of how our architecture developed well I'm not being flippant when I say yeah and they're similar and maybe that following he was following um miles warren um on the corner of andover and cheltenham and they just got re done up I used to live there and they were by um oh god what's the peter bevin I think and they're similar you know um so that was why I asked how many were on the register yeah and I know that they're in the district plan thanks and we are yeah I wanted to follow on a little bit from your comments about um some miles warren and how significant um this is for us as being internationally a really interesting place to be for people to come and view our architecture how important is samal's warren to our city and to our nation um well yeah from an architectural perspective he is hugely important um these flats uh were a pivotal work at a turning point if you like um I think he'd just come he'd come back from england um he had these new ideas about styles materials use of concrete and it's so he he put those to use in little christchurch and it can be seen as a turning point I guess at the start of the development of the christchurch modernist style which is our familiar concrete you know white painted concrete block buildings which unfortunately we've lost a lot of those as a result of the earthquakes but this yeah it really is a key a key stone point in the development of christchurch and new zealand architecture and they're probably fundamental in miles warren's career without this sort of uh starting point every architect of of of significance needs to to get which allowed him to to then proceed to to bigger things without these small steps at the start there wouldn't be a warren amani potentially I think we need to move on a little bit so it's clear that they have high heritage value but the room seems to have some disquiet over the um the amount being recommended today so at this point do we have a mover for the staff recommendation or for a different amount so stuff recommendation jake um and melanie second okay um we will indeed um I'm just just checking the room at this stage to see if there's anything any further questions or first there's a checking for foreshadowing I'm happy to foreshadow that would decline the grunt well we wouldn't need to foreshadow that we're just voting yeah well that just came to the room potentially just whether there was a foreshadowed yeah yeah just whether there was a foreshadowed motion um for a different amount if anyone was wanting to do that okay um okay in that case jake will start um yeah just wanted to set a scene of where these flats are located they're in a um really unique part of our city that residential cbd that has a huge amount of history not just both built but also cultural history in that area as well and and um I i know uh better than anyone how how uh badly these areas have been affected by by um high density uh um poorly thought out land and um you know rubbish buildings um which I yeah um and I guess I also thought this is again a prime piece of cbd real estate that um is sitting on valuable land and the owners would have absolutely been better to to bowl these and and put up something less um less sympathetic to the area so I think we should we should be mindful of that when when deciding on this thank you tim I thank you just to kick off um it was warren and marnie so morris manny was absolutely a genius and if you've seen his hand drawn pictures and designs for the town hall not through just wanted to throw that in there um I love the irony of this the um dorset streets flats were described as the ugliest buildings in christchurch just want to remind you and in regards to size um if you look at some of the flats that are exorbitant prices at the moment and one can debate the equality um at six hundred thousand four hundred and fifty thousand etc I think these are a bargain to be quite honest and if you look at the land values that the neighbours have been trying to sell one of those places at a number of million um I think that it's important heritage to keep because they could be bold because the land values jake has described per square metre is I think well and truly absorbent but never mind all that what we're here today is discuss the value of the architecture that's what we're here to protect um I'm no architect and I'm no historian so I will go on this the um recommendations of the staff I i do debate sometimes about I love is all the discussion with regards to intensity of intensification etc in our city and the questions on architectural value etc this is the wonderful thing that they were described as the ugliest buildings in christchurch and they are now listed as new zealand uh um landmark heritage site of buildings so um I think it's a wonderful irony and I'll be supporting staff thank you sam uh yeah thank you as sort of uh mentioned earlier on and by sort of signaling potentially a foreshadow I won't be supporting this in its current form and it's not because I don't value heritage in the city I think that's really important to clarify um but it's a question of priorities across the city at the moment and this is a significant amount of money uh that is going into these these block of flats effectively these units and probably there's two things that stood out the first one was around I think your questions here which are very very good in terms of the budget allocation um and the need answers with respect I don't think we need to be going down the line of because there's money in a budget we should therefore spend it um you know it does become frustrating because it becomes a constant excuse or I guess a reason to drive a value but when we're making real sacrifices in the city at the moment you know we're having to stop um unless it gets changed in the ltp that mobile library van um you know which costs a fraction of this and a range of other issues uh that you know we have to make some real sacrifices so I would just hate to get to a point where these get rebuilt repaired and then potentially given the market movement have on sold and effectively the rate powers have footed the bill for that um I'm not sure that would be a wise investment for the rate pass so I would urge colleagues um to potentially not support this today while still acknowledging the importance heritage plays in our city thanks ann thank you um I think the rate heritage and um sir miles warren has been described as the doyan of post um describes the first new zealand to be knighted for services to architecture and really christchurch is is sir warren's place and known for that and this is something to celebrate into treasure and so um this is about putting a va we can't put a value on these things and economic value this is important for us as a city for us our identity so I will be supporting the staff recommendations today thank you mike and actually some my colleagues have read the report this building has currently been repaired it's not getting demolished um this decision is whether we actually contribute um to how much these private owners are going to pay to um to build them and the reason why it's actually um above the insurance settlement is because they're increasing the mps so um I'll actually be agreeing with sam and will not be um saying yes to this thank you um melanie um these are category one listed heritage building so I in my these they shouldn't be supporting any heritage in our city really because it's clearly the view that they're taking and it would be good to have more housing available once um once they're completed so um you know win-win any further debate yeah um look to me here at notwithstanding it's um what is it level one um class one heritage it's like art to me you know what's heritage to someone is not necessarily heritage to me and my heritage can often not be heritage to anyone else so it's subjective to me as is art I appreciate the reminder that it has been called the ugliest building in the city and um but it was still good to party in I have to say but on a serious note in you know I'm struggling with this full stop um and I think that councilman mcdonald made a very good point notwithstanding why we're even talking about this uh through policies and and so on the principle is that the mobile libraries which I'd never use in a payers and residents of the city and that's what 91 000 I think it was well that's crazy that we say no to that and yes to this so that's why I'm saying no to this um aaron it's been an interesting debate today um especially around people's tastes and architecture um and and and and it's correct it is in the eye of the beholder um I do appreciate the value of these to the city um I would have preferred the quantum of the grant was smaller and uh and on mike's point that they hadn't gone so high on the nbs and that stuck with the 34 because it would be considerably different it did say in the report because they're waiting on uh the seismic strengthenings for the next event um given how often the events come then you and I know the alpine fault 75 due within a 50-year period so on and so forth um but if you do the math you'd actually go with um the 34 and uh and just repair would have been safe so I agree with mike on that one and so I would have supported a smaller amount but not this amount karen would like to foreshadow a motion for a smaller amount what would that amount be up to you hasn't he already yeah um I i would be interested to hear if someone else foreshadows a smaller amount you think I'm also quite struggling with this one um but I don't think comparing apples with peers like mobile libraries with a heritage fund is particularly helpful here we have a heritage fund that we've set up because we are passionate and committed to retaining and repairing the heritage that we have left the little heritage that we have left as a result of our earthquake events look I'm happy to take staff advice on this because you are all over the heritage in our city they've come to you for this you're recommending it so on this occasion because I'm not an expert on this I'm happy to take staff guidance on this and and support know this is a renowned building throughout new zealand so I think it's in our interest to retain it so in light of that I'm going to support this today thanks pauline and I think I'd like to add as well that um you know I think that we have a fund which as councillors we signed off on in the annual plan last year and we signed off a certain amount that could be spent up to we don't have to spend it all absolutely but we also opened applications and I think that if someone with a category one building who has applied for this fund doesn't qualify uh I think we really need to seriously re-look at the fund um and when it comes to the the mobile library let's remember that as councillors we agreed um during the long-term plan process to propose that that be closed at the same time as signing off on a proposal that left heritage funding there so I think that's a decision for a future discussion over the ltp after submissions these are some funding for them today like aaron I'm a bit concerned about the amount um and so I'd like to foreshadow a motion of 240 000 which is 30 000 each should this resolution fail um to check with staff sorry I'm just out of the proposal to reduce their quantum but there's a equip grant is that um only paid out if it's matched by the local foreign uh no that grant's independent it's totally independent um and it's only for two of the flats which had an even lower insurance settlement okay cool and just um if we go down to 240 or 200 this would still qualify for a full covenant we're in debate yeah so would still be in place just to clarify brendon with a lower grant the covenant the covenant um yes the covenant comes in at fifteen thousand yeah so it's a limited covenant yep right and you annie don't get back to your debate oh sorry I i thought um it was over 150 000 it was a full covenant that's a limited covenant which is between 15 and 150 and then once you're over 150 then it becomes a full covenant right full covenant is in perpetuity um and has has more um constraints within the document it's a it's a more um but the key question is with serious foreshadowed quantum the full covenant would still be able to be on this property content only only if the owners are accepting of that there is no there is no requirement in the grant criteria to have a full covenant below that figure okay you only you only you only go to that full covenant once you get a grant of over 150 000. okay so any debate yanny you know I support heritage is actually we've got a number of heritage items in our city so I am concerned about the quantum of the grant and I would prefer a reduction um so I'd prefer to support the foreshadowed amendment rather than the substantive because we've got so many other priorities for heritage in our city as well we just heard from would you like to close no no jimmy I'm reluctant to debate but now I'm still concerned the amount of the the funding because why if they go with the insurance their full coverage 1.5 million dollars but they want to upgrade upgrade from the 34 percentage mps to the 67 they have a show for the 1.4 million dollars so actually these you know when those requests we go and find in 25 percentage but amount is still quite a lot particular compared to purely as well maybe lex wine no it's a 366 the case they're a big amount but your full cover we don't need to clean anyone so I I'm still concerned this amount I took four shadows can minimize I would like to go to the either yani or save us one to 200k or 240 because 366 cases a big amount from repair I think is unfair to those survived here thank you very much if there's no further debate I'll put the staff recommendation all those in favor please say aye those against no I well it's it's lost and we moved to the next one yeah yeah yeah motion which is the same except for the the dollar amount um 240 000 which makes them 30 000 each and I don't think we need any more debate on that one um do I have a second of that though jake thank you so that's me and jake kendrick I know you can't no no you can't move you can't_''_2124.8 do an amendment this is a different motion there's a new motion all together so jake's fine yeah right in that case all those in favor please say aye aye any against uh division councillor cheney yes councillor councillor coco councillor cotter yes councillor daniels no councilman davidson councillor galloway councillor golf councillor joe hanson yes councillor kieran yes councillor no councillor mcclellan councillor scandrix is that nine councillors thank you very much okay and now we move back to uh the heritage incentive grant for
Urban regeneration biannual report so october through to march this year thanks martin I'm not I don't have my glasses on is that miranda next to you yes I can see that I can't see anything else okay um so welcome thank you very much if you can get um give us a bit of a run through that'd be great then we'll move into questions uh kiara my name is martin kaczynski I'm from the urban regeneration team this is miranda charles my colleague and uh we have the rest of our our team here as well to answer any questions so this is the suburban regeneration biannual report looking back at the period of october to march and um these just to repeat um these reports are looking at that period they're not necessarily up to date since uh since march or looking forward um the this report is uh has been out to the community boards for comment and received no further comments uh the we've chosen to highlight in this report the progress made on the greening the safety strategy and also reviewing some post construction monitoring in sumner village and uh suppose it ends on looking uh at the future of this report and the direction we would like to take uh future reporting to basically uh follow council priorities while um focusing mainly on projects that are are taking place in that that particular financial year instead of our current format which looks at every single one of our master plan and other priority areas even when there isn't funding or progress necessarily within that reporting period sorry my I'm constantly failing on me uh questions tim yeah yeah yeah thank you and I first apologize I can't remember this coming to our community board so I do apologize for that but um I noticed that there's nothing with regards to selling street shops it's very much so I'm just wondering with regards to in the next report I suppose we've got a community board briefing this afternoon which I'll discuss with melanie but I just not want to really kind of wonder what that is I think good oh I can um attempt to answer the question now if you like yes yes um the suburban regeneration biannual report was released for the community boards roughly about the time that our omnibus briefing came around late last year and um at that time we we highlighted that the boards had been sent the report and and the date for feedback uh selwyn street master plan uh their current project is a stormwater upgrade renewal project and the streetscape upgrade has been phased for later in the annual plan yeah so I kind of got split I think to the um and you'll be able to correct me if I'm wrong but the the um landscaping has been removed and put into naval point which we agree but I i I slipped up there again it's totally my bed but the other one was out to 2027 but it is an environment that is highly stressed so I just yeah because we've got the issue with nz uh nzta with brahms street etc eddington school and a number of others so just yeah yeah with the community boarding sorry was just interested in terms of it says that um change requests are considered throughout the year so like some areas we've got um in some ways it's a shame that we don't have the list of the projects but I know our community board got like a really good memo that showed a number of projects that weren't funded um so and it's got every project so you can kind of see like in phillipstown for example we haven't really done what we said we were going to do but obviously that's because of the four laning but what's the process to get reconsideration or recollaboration calibration of things that should have been done but haven't_''_296.0 been done for whatever reason put into the into a better way of getting progress through the chair a recalibration of the master plan capital program was done a couple of years ago and that those projects were shown in that current in that ltp at the time um since that recalibration process I think we've been through capital program in terms of prioritizing projects I think we've previously messaged the community board plan is a good way for our boards to highlight the pro master plan capital priorities and in terms of how the current draft capital program is showing decisions are still yet to be made so there may still be an opportunity to adjust that current view so just looking at like the kind of progress do you see gaps along um the the master plans do you see some areas that haven't really had the same level of resourcing that we should start thinking about if we wanted to um look at progress like are there any immediate gaps that spring to mind in our master plans of actions that we said we would do that haven't_''_375.36 been done for whatever reason that you think are a greater priority now than before uh I think in many sorry miranda I'm just going to step in there and just um and just say that um miranda's already indicated that the community boards are the other their plans are the indicators boards seek priorities and that comes through the capital programme process in the decisions on what is put in the program and in what phasing it rests as I understand it with counseling yeah okay melanie so two questions oh sorry two questions um virtual related um the first one is is how many um suburban master plan projects are set out in future years it wouldn't be reported on at the moment at the moment uh showing in the draft annual plan we have uh work underway in linwood village and the main street upgrade some work in the main road master plan at mark's bay area there's also some funding being shared with the coastal pathway major cycle way from the master plan budget and under uh that must play in the ferrym roadmaster plan also showing is the up finishing the upgrade through austin village main street and funding is allocated to new brighton must plan land features for proposed rmaf road extension so which ones are out in future years that would not make it into this report it appears that there's projects until approximately financial year 27 where edgeware and selwyn street street upgrade have funding coming on board new brighton also has a several a multi-year pause um between purchasing land for the road extension and then following through road building and other public realm improvements in in that area so sorry a third question so um would it be much effort to actually just keep those in the report without adding anything in it so that they are continually reported on so they don't get forgotten you know they don't you don't need to update them nothing's happening but they can just sit there so that we can see them every time the report comes through yeah just a little section that says future projects or funded projects set to be complete I think that will depend on where the funding ends up sitting in the long term plan well as long as funding is there in the long term plan which it yeah presumably um pauline then so you could actually put that in the table on page one three one couldn't you so you put out the total figures but anyway my question is on page 131 um each week village fy 1819 is about 9 thousand dollars was spent the annual team what was that on and if you can't tell me now perhaps just a memo would do might have been something in conjunction with the cycleway there was that some funny spent on the tree lighting project oh yeah but okay so that was when it was budgeted and it was just spent this year um so that's the total cost of that I'm not sure the exact figure but there was some funding allocated um from last year spent this year and that was on the tree lighting well actually it would be quite good would we be able to get some more detail around that because I don't know with can you remember mike was it 15 000 or 25. so we're getting figures banded around it would be good to get clarity on how much that lighting cost um please because and also would be good to have more financial detail want didn't have an appetite for any more disruption um after the cycleways and all the um the infrastructure repairs they went through in that village people were feeling the pain for their businesses and I think we withheld something like 50 000 we pushed we pushed it out voluntarily to as you say 2027. I don't think we actually pushed it out that far but that's where it is now um and we kept back I think 50. so we're not sure how much of that 50 is left after that lighting project pauline would like that so information through the community maybe through to the community board might be the best place for that yes okay and but possibly in this reporting as well yeah it's you know I think I agree with mel there's not enough clarity on on the figures there thanks okay um and then jimmy yep hi um I'm interested in the um 4.2 the community-led working group and how you um decide who who was involved and how you got that together and yeah just I is a great time to invite josh newman to the table hi uh the community lead working group uh I understand is regarding the safety group so both have been led both out of the community board and also with the um the inner city s revitalization group so the working group for greening the east that was set up by the community board in conjunction the inner city east revitalization group that working group consisted of three members from the community board as well as three community members and they helped set up a plan for greening the east alongside consultation with the wider community that they undertook on their own behalf the safety group this has been directed around particularly linwood village so it hasn't been a process that council has set up that's been set up but again by the revitalization group they've called members from various agencies I think in total the request went out to 12 agencies and council sits around that table as staff as well as certain elected members are sitting around that table and we've also got representation it has a wide focus but it is evolving in shaping and we're looking at ways staff can incorporate that with other safety initiatives in the city thank you are young people involved at all are you invited no comment there are other safety initiatives around the city particularly targeted around youth spaces and we do have our community development workers working both within the inner city east and that safety group in the central city so they're able to bridge that connection quite well um but at this stage there isn't a youth voice particularly on that group uh I would say that the group is cognizant though of the youth experience given that we've got social workers and as well as police on that group that would be great if and going forward that that was a consideration when you you know getting these groups together to make sure there is that voice that would be good yeah I can pass that on to the facilitator of that group thank you or you could nudge jake beside you um so you've got other potential survival regeneration project I remember the appeal with the council also not only mention these four bullet points but also regarding to the church corner one you know particularly in church corner net kind of shopping center area try to improve upgrade I'm not sure why not here we have evaluated even there the scoring is higher than the bishop there so I i don't know whether it's a missed out or not so um council was presented a report around suburban regeneration priorities and it included the heat map which I think is probably the part that you might remember and uh council where staff put a list of recommendations some year one priorities and then some future priorities yes and the year one priorities were um as I recall the team remind me if I missed something um central city um and lynnwood village and uh and then there were future years priorities but council only resolved the year one priorities so largely that's what council staff are focusing on because there are no future year priorities that you resolved on but the city oh actually you also resolved to do some work on bishopville and um and that's that's that's where your direction to staff ended so that's what we've been working on okay so these are there also year one you see your one okay thank you the second one is regarding the uh the page 126 the southwest quadrant because I review your two kind of master plan synonym in the showing street masterpin but it is a south it's not the south west in southwest the geographic area have any master plan a moment no there's no suburban center master plans that came from the south west area yeah towards hallsville hornby yes that area the suburban center master plans for a post-earthquake response that uh were focused around the centers that had the greatest impact following the earthquake so um the centers out towards the south west of course were luckily missed in terms of large earthquake impacts and the loss of key facilities that drove most of the planning around the suburban centre master plans okay thank you you doesn't really come through in the reporting on the master plans is the impact of district planning or land use planning so if you read like um wolveston for example where there's a lot of detail around relationship to buildings to ferry road balkan scale talks about a number of things that we'd like to see including signage but there seems to be no mechanism to pick up that as an action and and I guess the concern like if you take wallston for example we've now got four gas stations all in a short space of road that have got resource consensus planning permission so I just wondered um what would be the process to get things that are mentioned in the master plans but not put into our district plan considered we have through the master plan process managed to drive some district plan outcomes uh of course you'll be aware that the independence hearing panel process happened at a similar time that these master plans were implemented and decided upon so in new brighton we did reduce the size of the commercial process and similarly recently we did the plan change in littleton and that really was driving some of those outcomes that we saw in the master plan process as part of our planning process we do investigate if there are the need to change district plan rules that would support center growth or regeneration we would look to do a plan change if there was a specific instance where it was valuable to do a change that would support that regeneration need and I do hear your point there around some of the commercial developments post earthquake along the ferry road corridor maybe not being to the aspirations that were set out in the master plan so the the change would need to go through a pla plan change process though so the good news is we're doing a district plan change now what's the process to get you to feed into those planning staff to put in some changes to address the principles and actions and the master plans uh do I understand that there is a long list of the planning and I'm probably not this one can we get some advice on that because it's pretty disheartening when we're spending all this money and we've got all these great visions of these of these master plan areas and then we're seeing development that kind of you know isn't ideal okay so we've got um we've had some time already as a council looking at the future district planning changes that are coming so are you after some separate advice on any district plan changes that might be needed to enable um master plan outcomes to support the master plan to support the master plan outcomes that we've identified okay so for example signage is one that would seem to be you know a simple one hopefully um but I mean staff would have to go through and look at what we kind of see in the master plan and then talk to the planning people about what changes we might be able to make but you know I think the summoner one's really interesting like it's really good feedback around summer and what it um can I just check with staff if there was a piece of work that we requested that was to provide some advice on district plan changes that could help get the master plan outcomes in those nine master plan areas how much work would that be I think that's a district in terms of yeah yeah because um if that's work that's going to be done by maybe the master planning staff and then the district planning then then that seems like a significant amount of work that would take away from things that we've already prioritised um and just before we ask for that advice I'd like to have an idea of what that might take people away from we'll come back it would it would be I think it would be a combination of staff but it would it would be a significant input from district planning staff who right now I know are focusing on the spatial plan the national the national policy statement on even development there's probably on the availability of that advice yeah so we'll we'll follow that up and see what's possible at the moment yeah okay um jake um on page 131 on that second table with the master plan according to financial allocation what um with the linwood village that 52k that's sitting in 1920 what's that for I mean I know there's 1.4 for 1920 for 2122 in terms of the streetscape and then 61 after that but I just can't quite figure out the 52 and then why the 1.4 isn't in the financial year as it's as it is in the draft long-term plan so the linwood village the 52 000 that's for the doris lust reserve upgrades and the children's interactive play art the uh the first phasing of the linwood village funding that's to do the planning design consultation side of the lynnwood village streetscape upgrade and then the later year is the build funding so we're expecting that to be in the next next financial year so is is that design money in the 2021 financial that's in this current financial year that gap of a year missing I'm just looking at the long-term plan and I can see 1.4 and 21.22 um and I just would have expected there would be a design amount for 2021 I know there is funding at the moment in this current financial year in 2021 financial year to deliver that design element so yeah okay we're fine there okay right is there are there any other questions no in that case um do I have someone to move the recommendations there jimmy in secondary melanie any debate no uh I just wanted to say that I do think will those changes be made um to keep in um all the reporting on all the different suburban areas yep yep so I think that's already been taking a night off to keep it cool uh in this case all in favor please say aye any against degree that carrie thank you very much okay thank you very much team and now we move to the fiscal
The room so I'm going to get the meeting away oh sorry I can't because it's one minute to go so counting down to one minute before we turn on the live stream now I have no apologies at this stage although there may be for early departure from uh james yani unsurprisingly yani is a apology for late arrival right so would someone like to move those two um melanie seconded by jimmy chen I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried I've got decorations of interest um councillor golf for public excluded item 28 and I've got uh tim skandra for the uh item and the mia's report that relates to venus um thank you the we'll move on to public participation and we come to the public forum first and I have the pleasure of inviting st john's christchurch to come to the table alice earnshaw morris I believe is representing saint john today thank you so much for coming here today and making the presentation thank you for over to you thank you very much for having me uh you'll need to turn your microphone on and you can sit down if you wish I tend to bounce around a little bit that's fine bounce around um so apologies so I am alice I am the area executive manager for saint john christchurch I also as you can tell from the green uniform uh someone who turns up on the ambulances from time to time so today I'm going to talk to you about what we do in the community and what I would like from you as counselors so the reason I'm here today is because we are the provider of one of three primary emergency services in christchurch but we are also the provider of a huge number of community health initiatives and services that tend to fly under the radar so um what I'm actually here to do today is to ask each and every one of you from your mirror write down I want to build relationships with you I want to find out what is missing in your each of your pieces of christchurch has really different needs and requirements I will add a small caveat here I'm used to giving this presentation over about an hour so I'm about to power talk at you um so apologies um look internationally we're a huge organization we're approaching our 1000th birthday we have a medieval history that quite literally includes the night's hospitalis um and right the way through to the fact that we used to have an island of malta you may have heard of it in the middle of the mediterranean that's why we actually have the maltese cross um we lost that uh in a siege with our favorite french villain napoleon and then way back look we fell into a balance for a little bit there we came back again under queen victoria which is why we actually now have the regnal animals on our cigna insignia as well this is the only organization I have ever worked for that has two lions and two unicorns on its logo look the order of new zealand actually started here in in christchurch we started down at a hall off the side of st mary's church in miraval now that's now known as all souls it's still there we're still connected to it we still have very strong ties into that community but we started off teaching first aid training we had nothing to do with ambulances at all christchurch back in 1885 had a paucity of medical practitioners so we were teaching people how to look after themselves we are an ngo which is sort of an odd historical discrepancy I guess when it comes to providing one of your three major emergency services but look it is what it is and as I talk through you'll understand why that sometimes works in our favor I'll also point out we're a rather passionate bunch 40 percent of our paid staff across the country also hold at least one volunteer role I myself hold two volunteer roles within the organization which means essentially I have no life anymore um because I'm either on the ambulances at events or in my day job right us this is the emergency ambulance service we actually have three ambulance services in christchurch people are only aware of the one and think it's all one so in christchurch I've got three stations the hub and nine spokes the spokes look like houses they are signposted but they're very hard to find the reason for that is they are not manned stations this is not somewhere you can go and find help but they are scattered across the city the important piece for this conversation here though is the fact that I only have 15 vehicles across the city for emergency ambulance services um I run 11 of them in the day six at night these vehicles get run really hard we're almost running them 24 7 which means I have a small allowance in there for taking them off the road for servicing maintenance crashes you name it when you're putting that number of vehicles out on the road constantly things do happen but we also run them incredibly hard you'll note there that I have 140 volunteers who are on the who volunteer their time and energy to go and help people they have the same qualifications the same atps if you know what authority to practice is with nursing staff for example they do the same our volunteers have the same qualifications the same experiences they just do it for free and they're in key to what we do look our event ambulances is another team that we have these guys are static they're the ones who turn up to rugby games to qriket games to music concerts to wild food wine and food wrong city there for a second these guys are static that if something goes wrong at that event they can't up and leave and take someone to hospital they will provide first level care and they will call the emergency ambulance guys to come and pick them up and take them so every time we run an event for example um electric avenue a few weeks back if something goes horribly wrong at that event someone gets very sick when you take them to hospital we are pulling emergency ambulances one of those up and take them the third ambulance crew that we have uh in christchurch is a weird one uh look it's a team of specialist staff who deal with transferring patients between facilities so this is post people who have had post surgery who are going from christchurch hospital to birwid for rehabilitation or the other way round of surgery at burwood did not go according to plan we need them back into christchurch hospital or coming from one of our private facilities into christchurch into christchurch hospital as well um just so you know that that exists they do look quite different in terms of our funding we are currently 78 funded by central government that's through contracts with ministry of health and acc I am going to be incredibly clear with you that 78 is only for the emergency ambulance service not the other two anything else that I talk about after this point is not covered by that funding so we are less than 80 funded to provide our ambulance service the bulk of the shortfall comes through uh donations from the community we're to buy ambulances and pay for staff tomorrow and saturday please give to us we really need it right things you don't know about us we run youth divisions in christchurch we have 500 cadets these are kids from six years of age three to eighteen I run 11 groups in christchurch to do this this is essentially a youth program the cheapest one you'll find in the country but this is essentially life skills leadership skills and a very generous helping of health a lot of our kids move into uh medical professions of some sort whether it's allied health paramedicine or going to be doctors and surgeons this is a great starting point for them we're also cradle to grave uh we don't actually get rid of our staff once they leave we have a social and service group for retired staff my eldest member is 92 in christchurch george has given 79 years of service to the organization and to your communities and he is still active it's really impressive but we don't drop them we keep this as part us and continue to provide service to the community moving on community care things that you may have seen us do um we have volunteers in the emergency department at christchurch hospital these guys provide the caring support that the ed staff cannot so ed are busy they're trying to stop you vomiting patch up the bleeding all the rest of it our volunteers in there actually say are you all right you've been here for four hours now with your mum do you need a cup of tea is your mum cold does she need a blanket they can do the personal caring that the ed staff simply don't have time for and we don't expect them to have time for that I've got and there I've also got the pediatrics I'm about to start in the next couple of months new zealand first of having these volunteers in our intensive care unit as well at the request of the canterbury district health board so we'll be moving through for that we also run kieran caller this picked up uh dramatically based service where we match people up and provide friendship therapy pets this is starting that's moose moose no longer works for us but he's a very cool dog um we've this is a growing service we're currently in aged eight five aged care facilities in christchurch our wait list for this is bigger than we can match at the moment but this is essentially just another recruitment drive for volunteers and their dogs this goes through an amazing process to sort out the wheat from the chaff before we let them go anywhere but this is essentially friendship pets will be moving into primary schools to help with reading programs as well for children right as thinking of schools asb in schools we teach children to save lives from when they are early childhood education through to cpr and high schools these programs started as a pilot program and initiative here in christchurch and is now rolled out nationwide and we've had a lot of lives saved by our kids we're just extending this at the moment we started off focusing purely on strokes and react to that as well through the fast acronym thinking of kids in schools we are also starting to work on mental health and mental well-being this is a particular program that we are aiming at our intermediate aged children these these both these programs sorry are free to schools um this is part of what we do as our charity all these things are what we do as our charity work but this is about the fact that intermediate age children have some real issues around building resilience strong relationships and a strong sense of self-identity you also in the mental health stats that keep flying around this is some of the work that we're doing to try and head that off at the pass we are looking for a partner this is being run as a pilot and getting very good reception around the country but we're looking for a partner organisation to help fund it so that we can roll it out and have it be free to schools that's all right but power power shops these are starting to turn up medical alarms you've seen the ads for these this is what keeps people in their own homes about a third of these calls that come through to us are accidental activations however we can actually turn up and check on people and make sure they're fine uh first aid training this is where we started this is what we still offer we teach everything from babysitting courses through to advanced resuscitation skills for health practitioners we cover the the works um oh and we have a mental health first aid course as well everything else that we do look we're running a whole lot of pilot programs we have because of the fact that we started in christchurch we've got the only fleet of vintage ambulances for example in the country but we're also doing work around getting aeds into communities and teaching the communities cpr for free so we're working quite closely with the otahi community housing trust at the moment and getting uh getting places into them um I think that's me yeah well done well done you know thank you is that there is an incredible you know breadth and depth to what you do and uh I think it is a really helpful reminder especially as you go into your campaign for your fundraiser this weekend uh just to remind people how much we do you know rely on the generosity of not only your own volunteers but of others who will financially contribute and as I said when I started ideally what we're looking to do is actually to reach out to each and every one of you and say can we actually sit down and talk with you can we talk about what's happening in your communities can we talk about what is needed what is missing where should we be focusing next you couldn't have chosen a better meeting to make that point too because you've got every chair of the every community board sitting in behind they're presenting their reports today and I know that they are going to welcome saint john's you know directly relating to them at the community board level and I know that they will you we want to hear them we want to know about it we can't help if we don't know what's going on and sometimes we get our kids a little bit stuck in the emergency ambulance service in terms of about immediate focus well I really appreciate you reaching out today um really appreciate your presentation and I know that the community boards um and I'll just ask all councillors to join with me and thanking you and the way that I think and good luck for your fundraising this weekend that's annoying but never mind yeah but thank you very much for having me thank you thank you very much thank you right uh and the next one is davina penny uh who's coming to talk about land juice thank you the mps regarding productive land is hugely relevant only five percent of the available land in this country is luc one to two class oil and only fourteen percent of the land is luc one to three with all three classes versatile with high potential productivity the land shown north of red rluc 123 land and the green boxed areas are those indicated in a 2014 report to council regarding quarry rehabilitation and the green boxed areas are sites identified by the industry as being potential sites and the blue boxed area was consented in 2020 all sites are fully inclusive or significantly inclusive of luc one to three land valuable soil is removed through quarry rehabilitation in this region is not undertaken in a timely manner and we also know it's likely to mostly be in the form of just 30 centimeters of soil which is grassed very close to aquifers which may rise due to climate change issues pastural use and grass growing is the only viable option food production on any commercial scale is not quaran should not be consented as an activity on hpl there are alternatives for these sites and yes they may be a few cases further away from the end use but there are alternatives there will be claims from the industry to justify their use expect claims of increased carbon footprint instead of the usual handwringing of increased transport costs well the in and investigating alternative forms of transport including the electrification of fleets in this fast-moving technological space including on-site use the supreme court has said outright avoidance is a response that is legitimately available under the rma therefore no no consent should be considered on hpl regardless of what mitigation or remediation is proposed by the industry it's likely to be unproven and come with higher risk with 23 to 30 years of aggregate currently available in this region the environment should be sustainably managed in advance of the nps being gazetted provisions are already applicable in the rps and have been for some time my second request is for setbacks from quarrying activities to be applied that will offer protection to residents and communities all councils have a responsibility under the health act to protect or improve health and this starts with where activities are permitted and the land use consent falls at the feet of ccc and I will add today that he can have kicked that can well and truly into your backyard I'm asking that one kilometre is considered for the following reasons mitigation which is limited in effectiveness but it's free to the operator technology is available used elsewhere that utilizes water but will include dust collection systems covered operations and out of hours ongoing mitigation currently non-existent but wind does not abide by quarry operating times and easter sunday was proof of this with regular high winds in this region pm10 and smaller can and does disperse high distances and certainly beyond 500 meters claims of lower distances by applicants are not substantiated compliance monitoring response and investigation is woeful and may indicate a breach of the health act there is no deterrent for operators to ensure they do not impact on those in the vicinity queries do not operate in isolation in this region clusters evolve comprising of several operators with cumulative effects which when combined are significant for those in the vicinity the carp indicated a cow barn would be one kilometer from a residential zone a more significant setback than that for a quarry and additionally residential property owners must be given the same rights as those in residential zones being treated differently amounts to discrimination which is the ball rolling with where the quarry is cited tipping that first domino so please can I ask that you do the right thing for your residents current setbacks have proved to be ineffective particularly when super quarries involving several operators do become the norm thank you thank you very much um your submissions covered uh the um air quality issue which I think you've submitted to ecan on is that right I have but they did rightly point out the sighting of the quarries is that first domino it's where it's cited which does have a big impact and that falls in there and as you'll know the the the district plan was completely rewritten uh by the independent hearings panel as part of a process that was a post-earthquake land use recovery plan process uh and it was a um and this particular issue we are all very well aware of because uh the council as an organisation uh had to submit based on the level of expertise that they brought to the issue the council laws didn't agree with that and we expert advice to the independent hearings panel to increase the setback between quarries and residential so we'd totally agree the independent hearings panel didn't agree with our position with our expert and they accepted um the other submissions that they had received and so the setbacks are not um as what they're not sufficient in our view but we can't change our district plan um to achieve any any greater setbacks we tried and we were not successful in achieving that so we really appreciate the issue but the the solution isn't here but we do agree that ecan's role in monitoring the conditions of the resource consent as applied to air quality are absolutely imperative to the operation of the system and so um we will ask our chief executive to uh raise this with ecam to make sure that the monitoring processes are the best that they can be because you're entitled to that so that that's that's where I have to leave things because um can I just ask um would uh part or subsection e of section impose bylaws not it's tactile it's not it's not applicable it's in relation to the relation to other health matters but air quality sits with ecan not with the city council but I think you know that I think the the issue for us here and we want to move this forward in a positive way is to make sure that our council as an organization is ensuring that the um that we present to the to ecan which is the which is the monitoring organisation to make sure that they are actually um enforcing what are resource consent conditions they are obliged to do that so thank you very much for your um presentation this morning thank you I'm sorry we can't offer anything more than that yeah the residents are just going to be ending up taking legal action as an only recourse I think that's all we all they've got really true thank you right and we've got um the uh ross is that um I'm lost I'm not pronouncing your name is this philistine paulistan of me that's why I was having difficulty with it right thank you now I'm research submissions officer for the greater humber residence association and we fully support the fact that the rma is just a joke an absolute standing joke in the way it is worded at the current time and there is room for it to be improved and needs investigating however today I've got this here all luc one two three land in the christchurch city boundary should be excluded from quarrying operations it is productive land quarrying is non-productive it is destructive straight out destructive while commissioners are approving individual quarry operations as being less than minor effect the true fact is they are far more damaging than less than minor when combined together we have instances in town road where between fulton hogan's and ablets they cannot distinguish where the dust is coming from they are too close together they need shifting apart so the blame can be put in place these facts have been tested in the environment court and upheld ghra are currently undertaking dust monitoring and this will negotiations of suppliers in australia usa and china these monitors must be robust enough to stand up and court proceedings were remaining mobile so they can be located to various sites somewhat bewildering to see three authorities the city council ecan and the cdhb bearing the heads in crystalline silica sand and leave them more prominent parts exposed to the air over pm10 pm 2.5 dust the same attitude was taken with log fires would still have a serious smog issue difference here is the crystalline silica dust comes not only from crushed aggregate but also from the sand that aggregate lies in crystalline silica is also harder to see so is often ignored crystalline silica dust has also been recorded as traveling 8 to 10 kilometers crystalline silica also does not cause asthma but silicosis and other respiratory illnesses so in fact is far worse and more dangerous than any sort the quarry industry has long been suspected by many for its perceived lack of accountability or else they would have stepped up with the true facts instead of the lines they tend to distribute to distribu uh justify setbacks in australia india or anywhere else in the world new zealand is way behind the times on this matter and a review of the rma act is well overdue queensland requires a two kilometre setback if over 1 000 people live in a village while on india which is heavily populated requires one kilometer setback does this mean we now live in a fourth world situation it's our opinion these quarry operators have very deep pockets and very short arms when it comes to residence health and safety but the opposite when trying to buy within the city's boundary with quarries with earthquakes salvaging them often buried when it was meant to have been sought and relocated to safe disposal sites in short the public in the western area of the city had been manipulated for long enough we've had constant complaints about levels of dust and air area the dust issue has really come to the force since the earthquakes in the roberts road quarry opening when asked if complaints have been lies with council the replies you're just wasting your breath now I every bit is bad don't worry no one really listens to the complaints about quarries or past quarries such as those behind boston ave perhaps this dialogue needs further airing on fair go sometime in the future the greater hornby residents association believes no further quarrying operation should be approved between islington high high templeton and yelthurst there is a block of land in there that is suitable for industrial development or residential development not quarrying in the meantime the greater hornby residence association requests a moratorium on all quarry consents and approvals from today forward under the current district plan so public health can be considered along with residents concerns regarding the ongoing quarrying operations that have been taking place against their wishes this should be a full open as well as a transparent investigation moving forward any opposition from within the quarrying faction should be seen as merely merely trying to protect their patch so to speak while still ignoring residents concerns and health understanding orders I believe this request is not out of order seeing that there is an aggregate supply equivalent to some 23 years currently before the employment court so delay is not a factor thank you thank you thank you ross um look it's I think you've heard what I said to the previous submitter that um it's an inappropriate phrase but we're between a rock and a hard place you know when you're talking about quarry it is it and and you have talked about the um the resource management act the government has announced that there are significant changes coming the but I don't want people to have um an unrealistic expectation of what that might open up by way of public involvement and decisions around development so I'm just I'm trying to be as open about this as I possibly can I do note that the national policy statement for highly productive land has not yet been brought into effect it is still a draft they are still working on the detail of it we submitted on it in 2019 so it is um it's obviously been a process that hasn't led to something that I personally was very much the law from the development inappropriate development or use of highly productive land but so you've raised serious issues I'm actually thinking I'm coming to visit the greater hornby residence in the very near future so I'm now well prepared with a set of questions that I'm obviously going to be asked to answer on that day so but thank you very much I hope you've taken some comfort from the fact that the chief executive will follow up with he can no that was good thank you based on the ross and also davina the kind of the uh the deportation the winner emphasis still every council should have a responsibility to review also section 23 of the health act look I know how passionate you are you are the best representative for a council area that you could possibly imagine but I just don't want I i don't care I don't care who else I i offend around the table but but but but jimmy jimmy wants to make the point you you've made the point jimmy and hornby residents association I doubt that they will mind if you come with me and um and we'll we'll we'll follow it up with them but I think people do need to clearly understand the limitations um in our resource management system we do um we do and and and I know that you understand that we have been we have been trying within the parameters of the framework that we have to work to as well but we'll continue to work together as much as we possibly can so if I may say um yeah we have as you know we have problems with dust yeah it is not only limited to ecan and the city council it is um prosecutable under the crimes act and that may come completely eventually let's all take we hope not let's all take that offline because we we do want to get the outcome yeah so thank you very much ross for for um making yourself available um this morning and thank you very much for your presentation thank you thank you thank you and at the um amazing ara broadcasting students who are here today so could I have a special welcome to our ara students they are undertaking a course of study that leads them into the tremendous and tremendously important world of the fourth estate and thank you very much for coming and observing our meeting

journey the first steps to always the best no it's not it's the last step that's the best when it's opened and the people are actually using it so we're really really looking forward to that it's long overdue and air in our ward and there's another thing that's happening too about the hydrotherapy pool um there's funds being um raised within the community in the wider community so that we get we get everything um if we can in this build so we're we're um we're extracting external funds and support from from around um white christian wider christchurch and stuff to to actually get the whole

host at our community board was very good to get out in the community it was well accepted by the community and so that's yeah we're going to be doing a bit more of that this term as well we're following in the footsteps of our cashmere sprayed and community board so and after that we had the meeting on the um a meeting about the residents concerns about um the john patterson uh the yeah the rich medev and the john patterson intersection and um there was a lot of there's been a lot of emails flying around um about that for quite some time and we did have a meeting um straight when the road first opened and then we've had another meeting since then to see how the effects were because coming from a motorway um into a 40k area is is quite an issue so we just really really wanted to hear what the community have said um the the staff came and did a an excellent presentation of the uh the issues how they were seen and and they're gonna come back with they with three other um options for tidying up other anomalies india or other problems of it so it was a really successful meeting so that's um yeah now the um the click we click on the next yes this was the first so the great the greater hornby residents association organized um the great easter egg hunt and it was also um sponsored by the lolly shop in hornby so excellent they had um the three three parks at our in our ward branston park broomfield common and denton park so that was a really really exciting event and well run by the community for the community so that's much appreciated what's this place because there'll be more of that to come the next one please if there is a next one is that the lot well I'd just like to follow up by saying um the community garden awards were held last night and it was a a very very well attended very well attended there was about 180 odd people um actually came to receive that so anyway and then um yeah it job of putting that on so and that was another you know a good thing in our ward but following the two presentations this morning on the um on the quarry issue one of the things is we've got we've got e ken saying um when we present presented to ikea it's a christchurch city council issue it's a land use consent um that is that is an issue so what we really want what I'm pleading with is can we please get a a plan change can we please get a plan change so that we can get these issues sorted and get a closer relationship with please with um with christchurch city council on the land use and ecan you know that look the the chief executives just whispered in my ear that obviously the relationship between the two is the same I've already just explained that we cannot get a plan change on this matter we put up a proposal for a buffer zone which was rebuffed by the independent hearings panel so we don't have the um capability um I'm not gonna take um a submission from the community board based on a report that hasn't actually been debated by the um by by the um you know I mean it is not a matter that is in front of us today so um there is obviously issues that need to be followed up in terms of the close relationship between the council and ecan in terms of enforcement but um and and I will come and uh make sure that people are given the opportunity to understand what the what the key barriers are to changing the act but you've just heard the resource management act is all changing so I don't I don't want to I don't want to spend any more time on it now there's a lot of uh work that needs to be done in order to explain I mean we're able to say no I I'd rather not have a discussion I and you could if it chooses lodge a plan change it will take two years and it will be a long journey the we tried to get this and in two years and if we fail what will we have achieved apart from a vast amount of expenditure on expert advice and a decision that will not change the plan well I don't think that's I don't think that's rather not have a debate about it at a meeting where you have been asked to report on your council activity your community board activities and we have been this is an activity we have been involved in yeah and can I just say on another issue on air quality which is um ecan's issue mike and I went out with a resident one day three years ago a long time ago and and and the actual air was filled with particles which you could could actually see and in my experience with ecam they're not the residents say when they phone up and complain the ecam officer does not come out now I'm around the table um we have already asked that these issues are being dealt with um in relation to the relationship between it there would work and would you like to move the acceptance of the report second quickly speak to it thank you very much thank you cook debate yep all right have you got a question no no we're in dubai it's moved second sorry well it was just a question on helen's point was around is that when it's which wind is that oh no I'm I'm sorry I i just I just moved us we have the same issue in our ward when there's a norwegian they don't just don't turn up this and then you ring them and he can will say we've got two officers it's a norwich wind I'll we have already said that we will ask the chief executive to raise the enforcement issues with ecan because it is it does sit with them we can put it in our submission yes yes we've got a submission to ecan on the agenda today and we can we can do that yeah it's very quick just to say that we are have an activity level of service about how they respond to complaints about air quality yes I would encourage everyone that's concerned today to please make submissions to econ on their long-term plan asking for a level of service about responsiveness to air quality complaints we've already got it in our submission we have put it in and we'll certainly be speaking to it later today thank you thank you jimmy but thank you the the hospital home uh the lincoln community board to present to us so positive things particularly I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the the chair of the community born this time is a total difference from the previous 10 this time actually working together collaboratively also working together with the community so they raise this kind of issue the cultural query may be successful particularly over the last 22 years home be the the center might understand even now every day have people pass through to monitor what's the progress update status it means long-awaited complete the facility for the wider homebay area a nice swing wine now primary school it can attract more local people can come out and it's good the change but it's changing there's actually a transformation but regarding to community ball and the two kind of the residents you know the particular on behalf of the community to raise this issue this is a big issue because they already get some evidence you know these crystallized silicon or these pm10 they will affect the physical body you know this quite serious issue so my view no now we'll make the summation through the long term plan to the ek also you know I encourage community and also community individually make the submission to the econ we resolve the least problem as quickly as possible otherwise you know we can still not pay our responsibility because there's a particular critical health issue thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you thank you thank you uh right I've got the waikoura linwood central head clip community board um and alexander david is michelle was here um I am going to take it that the report has been read um we have no part a's today so um we have had approval for several road namings for a subdivision in port hills road we've had seedling and wheat chiefly we have had approval of discretionary response fund contributions to the mount pleasant pottery group incorporated towards the building upgrades there the sumner community pool towards equipment and materials coming here early learning trust towards resources and equipment the gaelic football and hurling association for canterbury towards costs of holding the new zealand gaelic football championships which was recently and christchurch transitional architecture trust towards christchurch east walks um the board have been spending a lot of time over the last month um engaging for our long-term plan we have been out in the community going to several well multiple community events and we've also been at eastgate mall and at the mount pleasant markets so been out and about and we've had some great discussions with the community which has been very valuable um I think we have discussed woolston boxing club the secretary and head coach of wolston boxing club presented to the board advising the board that the club had grown and that it currently has a huge wait list as the club's current facilities are not large enough um the club are investigating funding to purchase um and build um or lease a facility um and the board have agreed to request staff to work with boston boxing club to investigate possible facilities sites um for the club and report their outcome back to the board so they're doing some really amazing things um at woolston boxing club we're in real support of them in our community um we have had oh sorry sorry I'm all back to front today um oh wait well we're back it's not working when you push the button we broke it sorry um we have had our edible and sustainable garden awards so um due to covert we weren't able to actually have the ceremony um to present awards but we got out into the community and handed out the awards which is actually really awesome and the amazing stuff that's happening within the community and um actually people really loved being able to show off what they were doing so yeah it was actually pretty cool rather than standing in a hall um but we did also have our um community pride garden awards which we don't have photos for today but um they were very successful we had them at toodanga last week and yeah massive crowd always like a great place for bumping spaces and people sharing information and great stuff that they're doing within their communities um we have had a site visit to uh to poetry um it's very exciting it is a great size and I think the community are very very excited about it it was amazing actually being able to go inside and see what um the work is behind our facilities that we do have inside of pool is obviously a lot of work going on so it was really fantastic being able to see behind the scenes um and yeah we've got a lot of very excited people for that occurring sponsored fresh events um for young people and over the last month um the first on the 13th of march at the art gallery which was awesome and um the best part of it was actually being able to showcase it's a very dark picture you can't really see anything but um it was being able to showcase young people and their awesome musical talents like we had some really great performances by local young people um but then we also had scribe come along it was cool he did some rapping it was awesome and we have also had the welcome pool party which was awesome as well so we had really good turnouts with both of those events um we have had within our area the woolston gala which was on the 27th of march the avery gala on the 28th of march sorry we've really broken the system um and the phillipstown gala on the 20th of march um we also had the wolves oh no I see that okay did we fix it yeah okay we fixed it um and yes so up as well we've got the mountain pleasant pottery group opening which I think is a saturday and the fresh event the central hoops event which is coming up on the 21st of april and happy holiday so um sunita came to a board meeting the other day and it was really cool we had um our broadcasting students there as well and members of the public and we all got into holly so happy holi everyone thanks for having us thank you jake I presume you want to move this sarah a second any questions any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those of you know that's kerry thank you you're such a busy community board you do so much yeah we've got a lot going on so thank you for your patience in time uh waipapa papanoi inna's community board um thanks for having us along to present today um I'm gonna take the report as read and we don't have any part a so we're just going to highlight a few things that first off I do want to say we this year decided not to run our community board events like the edible gardens and the community pride garden awards and those sorts of things and we put that money back into our funding to go out to community groups this year um so that's why we don't have any pretty pictures of those things sorry uh it's just acknowledging children's study which is really a city-wide event but with some high involvement from the waipapa papua new england staff and in particular our recreation advisor it was really sad to see that it couldn't go ahead in person this year because of the issues around covert levels at that time but was really what was really uh good to see was there was really good engagement online it shifted to an online event and there was really positive engagement uh by the community with that format and looking forward to it coming back in person next year um we had our first principal's meeting for the year this is something we do once a term have a breakfast meeting and we usually invite a guest speaker along and then we just have a general chat about what's happening in the schools and this month we had staff from the council's learning through action program come to speak about what's on offer for schools through their programs part of the reason for doing this is because our board has recognized the importance of civic education for young people and so this year we've actually set aside some funding to pay for transport to get school children to those council courses um programs on that so we wanted to let the principals know what was on offer there and we've had some uptake on that already so that's great to see uh community events sort of summer season is coming to a close now we've had a slice of summer a series of events the final one held at the end of february in sheldon park run by belfast community network also on the same day the community focus trust ran a community day in saint albans both of those who attended we also had the shirley shine event which was run by um shirley community trust and that was attended by over a thousand people at mcfarland park and then that bottom picture there is one of our summer with your neighbours events it was the willow view community gardens in redwood springs at the reserve in there marin councillors will be well aware that this weekend we're opening the saint albans community centre construction is complete it's been handed over to the sunorbin's residents association who are the operators of the facility we've been gifted the name corhinger which really has a triple meaning in this context it really means to gather or to collect and it reflects the geography of the area with waterways that come together as tributaries it also reflects the historic use of the area by manifenua in gathering as a kai area and also the now current use as a community centre of the community gathering together under that roof the official opening is the saturday morning you will all have been invited and we look forward to seeing as well um another thing that would have been happening behind the scenes is this correction of a historical misspelling of what has been called the kaputoni stream and this came up as we were looking at consultation on name changes at two reserves on the stix river and the original maori name of the waterway was kaputahi but the story goes that it was misread and then has been spelled incorrectly ever since um so we're wanting to restore its original name and so that process is underway yes a long time ago in just uh an update for councillors on in the mirror on downstream effects of the northern corridor motorway uh there's ongoing work at the moment and really experimental traffic calming underway in consultation with the local neighborhood in the francis street area that is leading to some frustrations and adjacent streets at the moment francis avenue is being cul-de-sacked for a couple of weeks in one format and then there's a mid block cul-de-sac being trialled again under temporary traffic management so that we can get feedback from the community on the does to traffic patterns one thing it is doing to traffic patterns is it's diverting some traffic including local traffic to adjacent streets and we're getting a lot of questions at the moment from residents about about that and it's keeping our staff and our council staff here very busy responding to those also last week there was a public meeting in redwood for residents in that area who are being impacted by noise from from the motorway that meeting was organised and facilitated by duncan webb we had nzta and project staff in attendance as well there's been some actions come out of that there's a number of questions about aspects of the design being asked by residents one of the really obvious things at the moment is we're in the period where the motorway has opened and is being operated at full speed but the final low noise asphalt seal on the road is not there so we've kind of got the worst of both worlds and how it's operating right now that seal is programmed to go on in could be up to a year away for the from that being completed so there's some questions being asked at the moment that's sitting between dr webb and nzta all the papanui community board staff members and our two councillors were both at that meeting as well to support residents who are really clearly being impacted by that issue yeah one thing that residents do want to happen straight away there is for nzta to drop the speed limit on the motorway to reduce the noise um they were told at that meeting that this wouldn't make enough it wouldn't make a noticeable difference um but um as simon said duncan webb is following that up on behalf of those residents as a local mp that's us thank you I've noticed that council davidson's got a couple of um additional recommendations that he'd like included in the resolution which is requesting that I write to wakako tahi and request that the speed limit is temporarily temporarily reduced to 60k until the final services service is added so from my understanding of the it was opened it was at a lower speed and it was um noticeably quieter than it was when the speed limit went down and um they publicly have noticed that cars are going well over 100 at the moment so bringing it down should and the second one is that I write to the minister of transport outlining council's concern with the current speed limit of the motorway and adverse effects on neighbouring residents but again I assume that is until the final service is added yeah okay um pauline I just want to ask simon about the time frame for that second seal I know that nztea said it could commence in the spring or october but I thought they said it would be completed early next year are you sure they said a year uh you are correct yeah early next year completion is the current target I guess yeah we're only just into april so it's it's yeah I thought you meant a year from when it's coming they start it in spring and then it's obviously they've got that's relevant for the time frame that we're asking for here so um yeah thank you um aaron a question around why the number of 60 and not 80 was selected I live 50 meters from an 80k state highway and it's it is a big difference from 100. right so that was why you chose no there's there's a little bit more to it than than that which I can talk to during my debate okay well it might be useful in terms of questions but I don't want to take away from the community board um but I might allow a couple of questions for of you might as the I'm assuming that you're moving the the total package yes and you're seconding the total package right yeah okay well we'll come back because I've got questions of the community board so I'll just come back to you um on a separate matter is it yani it's this matter in a different matter yeah well can you deal with a different measure with the community with the traffic has there been any progress on that uh we're having a briefing next week from the um council engineer who's been looking into that so I'll have an update after that right but is it still a it's still a relevant live issue yes absolutely okay and did you have a question for the community board on yeah just on the um the highway or the northern motorway um I was just kind of interested if anyone's looked at the resource consent or the designation if there were any requirements around noise because I find it a bit weird that we're we're writing like normally there'd be construction and there'd be yeah it has a requirement that it's 57 decibels um maximum and that they have been doing testing um not at peak times noticeably um and there are some spot spots that are currently over that 57 but they say they'll come down hopefully once they put the final sale on so that requirement is when it's actually complete so there's nothing in we should actually be trying to address this issue which has happened in other parts of the city as well is around when we're building or we're in an alliance or we're consenting that some thought is given to the transitional period before resurfacing happens so it doesn't we don't just keep getting into it we can take that on board when we address it I mean there's nothing in there that prevents that from being included mike did you want to just talk quickly on the oh just quickly so one of the questions that was asked during this whole process since the noise became an issue with would dropping it to adks make a difference now waka katahi has continually said actually no there are only one or two decibels and you won't notice it and they say you'll notice things after three decibels and if you actually go through all the information on their website actually reducing it from 100 to 70 has a 5 4.6 dispel drop so it's clear that if we bring it down below that's from the nzte website which shows there's a clear drop if you go from 100 to 70. so actually if we go past that 80 go right down to 60 then they're actually going to give a have a lot more effect to what's the noise at the moment it's causing yeah and of course that stops at 100 and that hasn't been my experience on there no it will need to be enforced it's an observation um so um so so I'll yeah the police are just nothing me being relatively ignorant so what's the current speed limit 100 it's 100 so you want to drop from 100 to 60. yeah keep it real this is not this is a request that I write yeah no no just just for context and and the context will be put on the letter so that all of that detail all right um so it's been moved and seconded so I'll open it up for debate pauline just wanted to touch on that um and thank you for the meeting that I attended as well and the thing is that um a couple of things the residents pointed out was when a motorway is built in say auckland and it's within 200 metres of residential house they put up fences up there and they have they mitigate the noise and that question was posed to ncta and their response well was there's more cars on there than we have here and that really didn't go down that well because there's a reasonable number of cars using this motorway as well and more a bit more to come so that was the other thing and somebody mentioned that there could be there are acoustic panels that can be put up rather than solid fencing um so they may look at mitigating it in that way um also the fact that they measure this the decibels within 200 metres of the motorway whereas many of these people lived 650 metres away they were having to have their doors and windows closed because of the roaring noise they were really really stressed about this and saying that their by so they've been really really negatively impacted by this and also as emma pointed out the the monitoring has been done between 10 am and 5 pm which is a little bit unfair because the traffic does begin at look I don't know 6 30 probably so I just wanted to highlight those points that people were very very angry very upset and they were there first and this motorway has been imposed on them so um now that the government has brought the well-beings back in to the local government act I think we've got a bit of leverage there to try and get some some sympathy for these people and to have a temporary mitigation would be very very helpful so thanks leanne for doing that um aaron um I would have been very supportive of adk I myself live 50 meters from state highway one and uh when we went through this process and had the temporary threat and and it broke up something terrible down there they've had a bit better luck on this one um and with the vehicles going would have been a lot happier with 80 versus 60 it seems a very big jump from the current hundred and that road is flowing really well admittedly to the detriment of those neighbours right now until that seal's done so um I would have preferred would ask for 80. or are we asking for 60 to try and get to 80. yeah we're in debate yeah um I know that it sounds like a a really big drop um but it will have a really big impact the reality is that when people are driving on this road everyone always takes into account that 10k buffer um that you know that you're going to be pinned in things for so I think the asking for 60 hopefully will mean that people travel under 70. and while the road surface is currently unfinished without its proper sort of state highway type top seal and the quiet surface seal I think that that's a really reasonable thing to ask for that that they do that so state highway one that runs near councillor kieran's place will't yet really briefly I'm happy to support it um and I only do that because we're not making the decision it's only a letter to the transport experts who will consider it so I get exactly what you're saying aaron but in the end they'll take on this advice amongst everything else and and this is only a consideration we're not making a decision today so thank you mike do you want to close off yeah just quickly and obviously there's quite a few things mentioned in the report and so but what we are seeing I guess in the area is the um impact of not just the motorway but also development um what that's having on local community if you look at langdon's road and the massive development that's actually occurring out there and how that's impacting residents and then the motorway we always knew that it was going to have a big impact on st albans which was seen I think this was a little bit more of a surprise and but actually when we and they were all very they were frustrated they were angry they were tired it was it was very compelling what they were saying and that was the live experience they were living with it and some of them were quite fun from the motorway and they were could not sleep because of the noise that was coming off it you know that was presented by a few um officials um and I just don't think they were quite listening to what the people actually was were saying and for them to to actually say that she won't notice a difference if we if we drop the speed when actually their own information on the website says something different is is a shame this is only a small stretch it's not the whole motorway it's just a red cliff road where pretty much the residential is all all finished so it's not going to have a massive effect on travel time but it will have a massive impact a positive impact on the people that are living around there suffering from this noise that's just a request I really hope that waka katahi listens to it and actually understands that this could be a solution for a short period of time until the the seal is surfaces applied and maybe it may speed them up a bit too to get it done quicker thanks thank you thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you thank you thank you uh spreading cashmere uh why horrible uh sprayed cashmere community board carolyn potter don't think lee's here can I just say in support um I just want to say that we had a big three big nights last week and um I just want to thank publicly thank staff led by joe in our local office I just thought of that when I was stepping down and thinking of the hard work they put in for all three separate occasions thank you um we've got no pates uh but we had we've had so many small um small and big occasions in our ward uh this was the celebration this was amazing I found out this a pro this campaign to stop the right-hand turn out of barrington started more than 20 years ago the staff kept saying to me these three people were involved 20 years ago and that formed the foundation of the older persons forum in our ward and I kept saying no that's not true I've been on the board for up 10 years and I know that these people it was true these people started it 20 years ago a campaign to stop the right-hand tune out of barrington mall the staff knew it I persisted in saying they were wrong and I was wrong and they um they started the older persons forum which continues to this day in which meeting was held yesterday in our um offices and um it was and then the spray neighborhood network was formed and it started campaigning on it as well so it's been a very long time that they have wanted to make this safe and this council staff have responded before but for reasons of finance it did and we had a celebration in the mall because it wasn't appropriate to have red ribbon across the exit from barrington mall with traffic and there we are with dennis and um sonia um leaders of the spraden neighborhood network cutting the red ribbon that we draped over everyone's shoulders um in the mall and we had a cup of coffee and we had a cake which went all around those people there and some an ex-member of the spraydown neighborhood network sent flowers up from invercargill thank you this is our um this is the edible and sustainable garden awards I'm so sorry that um you've made the decision not to have them anymore um saint albans but I'm sorry just this year yes because um it was it's such a fine excuse I started it I know you did we copied it but we introduced the edible sustainable sustainables and that that's that's ray king from the horticultural society it the range of people who got awards on this is just wonderful young old many ethnicities diverse wonderful is consulting on the ltp I think everybody who's consulted on the ltp will understand that not many people are interested in telling us about what they should we should put in or out of the ltp but are always interested in telling us about their roads and rubbish um but um this is we we did it in south library and we did it in barrington mall and um so we and where else have we been we can oh we've consulted in other areas as well and it's been it's been an enjoyable process this is the blessing at west braden's school we had a marvelous photo of the red sky in the morning as we walked into the school grounds and for the blessings I do like the ceremony of blessings walking around the new building and touching the walls to make them safe I don't know it's sort of almost romantic this building one building at spraying school has five kitchens so the education system is shifting its way of teaching people how to live their lives not just it's a very interesting thing for those of us who are older to consider and to understand so um and the blessing was a great experience this is the cashmere valley reserve which is the probably the most popular playground in our awards its location is between the river and the hills and it seems to attract people from everywhere it's got it's one of the few places that's got a pedestrian crossing outside that is actually recognized by cars um but the council did a great job of um doing a range of plantings outside of that board area and but this was this is the map which led to quite a lot of drama between uh involving um our area and um horswell hornby's area as well with the residents from craycroft and westmoreland my brain went up again and that is the size of the road between the two suburbs that is now open and the residents had been promised a that there would never be a road between the two suburbs back up the hill and b that when there was before the lights went in so there were some difficulties some tension but nonetheless we had an excellent meeting arranged by the staff local staff and civic staff richard and his team and um by the pardon and john higgins oh I'm glad you mentioned him because he has a hard job and he was extremely gracious and the meeting went well and I think there was a greater understanding on both sides of the table by the end of it and this is the board meeting at sprayton school um we have we alternate our board meetings from 8 am to 5pm and this was a 5 p.m meeting at spraydon school and the principal in the middle there took us out around the school grounds to show us the changes that have had to be made in the buildings that have been made they had about three kitchens and didn't they in the block that the their children are in um and they're next door to hillmorton high and they talk to us about establishing a very close relationship with that high school it was and we had several people presenting to that community board including the local the local garden community garden and the young people from kashmir high wanting more basketball courts which everyone wants and there were other things that we did including discussing the eddington crossing the hill morton high I got taken around the hillmilton high new block several kitchens by the principal we had a residence meeting at hoon hay which was brilliantly run one hour out the door and then later on um this last weekend mel and I took the ltp consultation to an egg discovery easter egg thing at the same place we had um a lens down um play school had a celebration the george v reserve had a celebration which tim and I were at the cashmere view park the um the cashmere view park and I saw the biggest rubbish dump in our ward going out in the community cars that I've ever seen and staff are now looking into the causes of this rubbish dump and why it's there and how we can remove it right as we speak restored mill building in edington that's it very good thank you so uh tim would like to move it and you've got a question um and melanie would like to second it yes I guess um following on from um carolyn's um mentioning the gosford way um uh meeting and with staff I do want to thank staff they're quite right they were very gracious but they they admitted they could have done things better so I think that's a really a good way to go forward to admit that it could be things done better and to um to explain how we got to those things it wasn't perfect but to learn as we go forward we're always learning I think it's really important one of the interesting things and it was mentioned with the others community board the nzta took sound recordings from a certain time of day and it's absolutely a waste of time because we also had traffic counts taken in december from the certain and intersection which is a waste of time because of school holidays we've got to really get a lot better at that and it's got to be light for like in front of a better term um I think with the um lee road hoon hay road we've got a lot of opportunity there while it's being done up and I'd hate to lose that opportunity with staff as we kind of say oh well we've moved on now so I do still want the community board to work with staff on those opportunities because I don't think they can be lost it's too important and we've now gained a bit of faith back with those two residence associations who we have worked with for a long time we had a great working relationship it got kicked in the teeth without question over this um and and you you'll be part of this as well so we've got we've got to keep that momentum to keep that faith which we have now re reun if we lose it again the work that we do as elected members both community board permanently well he was franketh and I would be good on him thank you thank you tim is this part of the debate oh sorry I thought that was debate um yeah just in terms of the ltp engagement no well okay um do you have like a ward fact sheet or do you think it'd be helpful just when you're engaging with people to have more oh yeah we had some hard copies I know it's contrary to policy but we had some hard copies to end up because people want to see them and staff had presented the information really well we also had a training session on how to do that bubble thing yeah we had a training session with local residents on how to do that as well so that's using the online tool yeah yeah all right okay um cool thank you and happy to have a comment when it's appropriate are we in comments now or debate it was the debate before I allowed you to ask a question oh I just wanted to make the point that it you to everyone that's been involved I know that's been a long standing issue I think what's interesting for council at a governance level is the fact that we've got langdon's road a similar development happening still after 30 years of something not in this community no but the issue around planning for shopping please don't disrupt the meeting that's enough why would we just allow it to keep happening yes I wanted to um further acknowledge staff thank you carolyn for acknowledging staff I mean I've been involved as well in many community meetings over the last wee while in staff go over and above and we really appreciate what they do last night I had three three staff were cleaning up after the garden awards um on their own stacking chairs um putting food away doing dishes it helped us even at night so um we really do appreciate what what you all do so thanks thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carrie thank you is um bank spencer community board glory piden okay thank you okay um a few updates I do um take it that our board report has been read and there is a few things in there that has been going on lately just a few things we'll point out to everyone last month we had our board meeting at the gate in ecuador public engagement was strong on the 15th of march with several public forums booked and a couple of hot topics the board was keen to accommodate the expected large numbers um and the meeting was moved to the gate at that time also we were in discussions about covert and we wanted to make sure that even if we did change alert levels that we could still cater for the engagement that was requested from the community public forum topics included the accra public picnic tables roading issues steadfast development ltp in the eccara service center citizens hub desk and the ikaro wastewater that day we had 30 to 40 public come to that that meeting so hence why we did make that decision to move every single one of them um in favor and supporting the um continuing services of you know the continuing service center in nakarawa and the funding of that um one of the things that was also brought up at that meeting was the um we had representation from the akron bay's lions club asked us to consider allowing them to fund the construction and direction of shelters over some of the existing tables nicaragua including the bbq which the lions installed some years back the purpose for this was to commemorate 50th anniversary the base lines club in february next year enhance the across furniture scape provide much needed shelter from the sun for visitors and residents the photo shown there is um of a similar project which is in kaikoura so it's like so quite exciting having community funding coming to help add to the environment and our council assets uh come to paris group in nicaragua um regarding the symmetries um requested development of the western area of the acaral catholic cemetery an installation of the lynch gate lynch gate memorial gate council are currently preparing for all three acura cemeteries uh next steps are to seek input from anuku runanga that was a fantastic report and we want to thank staff for coming out to acaroa and head of parks to come out and actually work through the issues and so it is great to actually have the community board working with staff to come up with um moving forward issues that are going on so like say big thanks to staff coming out that day and it's like it's worth acknowledging stuff because I mean we ign we know that there are some tricky issues um on the peninsula you know in the one-size-fits-all thing you know the geography doesn't always suit and uh the regulations don't always conform to to how we need them so we really appreciate the engagement there that we are getting from staff on that yeah it is appreciated and lastly just regarding community funding recently we did have a combined meeting with the crochet city council staff and rata foundation regarding upcoming upcoming community funding groups from bernie's flat little river pigeon bay and community funding gets used with our community groups small amounts of funding from council and russia do go a long way so and it's acknowledged by the community as well so that's just one thing we wanted to acknowledge that is going on in the moment we do know that strengthening community fund is as well used and yeah well sought after yeah so that's us I i did want to acknowledge your missing out on a penguin um and I would say that we've lengie the one that we bought for um yeah it is staying nearby I mean it's good to hear that it's it's an in thai taboo but um you know it was there's there's quite a few penguins that I know that were um there were I mean they went for amazing prices yeah it's going to be interesting to see where the echaro one has ended up because apparently that was um I'm still not sure whether it actually has gone but um it's in acura somewhere but apparently there's community you know go out and find a penguin so where the penguin has ended up it's been quite exciting but um the last thing is um easter weekend was like say thank you for everyone for travelling local and um heading out to akaroa it was a very busy warm weekend over easter and roads were very busy but um everyone was very good but now thank you excellent andrew you'd like to move this do I have a seconder james goff put that motion I must but I'll keep it brief um just relating to the accaroa cemeteries matter I'd like to thank staff for work that was done relatively quickly in preparation for the 180 year anniversary of the arrival of the compta paris with the akaroa early french and german settlers on board at that weekend celebration there were a number of descendants of those early settlers many of whom still live in accord many of whom have spread far and wide since then but I'd like to particularly thank staff for the work that was done um repairing and restoring plus one um and for work done removing two um damaging wilding trees that had become um planted in some of the the grave sites the background and we've heard it in previous um ltp and annual plan submissions in the past is that the um cemeteries group the early settlers group had been very concerned at the lack of maintenance at the cemeteries they were delighted with the work that staff have done and are very pleased with the way the cemeteries have been maintained so that actually represents huge progress both with the work being done and in the relationships in accurate was great to see that resolution passed by the community board that now gives clear direction about the um memorial gate and the possibility of additional burial space so it was great that the community board were able to represent the community view in passing that resolution thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you and the last community board and what oh man we hope to get through them all before morning tea we will right um and and sorry about that joe so joe zervos is here um representing kelly who's not able to be here today because he's doing something equally athletic to his last uh reason for not being is that working yeah white eye coastal burwood community so apologies from kelly he's hiking the kepler track today so um for the last few days so you're stuck with myself and chris who's here to support me righty-o so I think you've all got the report in front of you so I've taken you've read most of it um where do we start off the approval of removal of a redundant metro bus stop and bow hill road this was a bus stop that hasn't been used for a very long time and it was actually didn't even have a sign on it so we just removed the yellow lines so that's really straightforward events in the red zone um we had polyfest and ltp consultation at polyfest and it schools performing and the amount of stalls and food and all color everywhere is a really good event um the red zone six bike race is coming up this weekend is it no 26th of april and that's a six hour mountain bike race through the danielle dunnell park area of the red zone anyone's keen you should enter um the east by east corner where this has been held there's actually been quite a lot of events happening lately and just over the easter weekend there was the um 50 miniature radio controlled semi trucks at the little rc haulers event um very popular with the big boys toys people they love it um a couple of the things relating to the red zone that I'd like to actually thank staff for um the bow pack fence which runs between the red zone and the actual park has been removed and opening up the space and it looks wonderful so I'm so thankful for that and south shore they we got hold of staff and got no camping signs installed in all the cul-de-sacs zone and I had a lady rang me the other day and she reported that they're working a real real treat and that they've had camper vans actually pull up into the cul-de-sacs and just continue driving on so she's really grateful for that and stitchomet is one of our community groups and they do a wonderful job they're a resource of upscaling sewing skills and recycling fabric and creativity and they do all sorts of things from making the mask which they made 100 for children's day which is unfortunately cancelled because it covered and they will use those masks for future events um with stitching they make wonderful quilts and things for people in need all sorts of blankets clothes everything little toys there um they are actually relocating from where they are now and they're moving into a shop in the surf side mall so that's really positive for them parkland's community meeting that's going to be held tonight it was scheduled to be held thursday the 4th of march but because of covert it was postponed local to listen um and look at ways and solutions that we can actually look at helping their community there's been a lot of crime and just especially around their little parklands reserve um so tonight we will actually be going there the council we have actually funded for a facilitator for chris minnie to actually go along so we're really thankful for that chris does a wonderful job and we'll be looking to work proactively with them moving forward coast snack um if you've been down to the pier you probably would have seen the little frames or you've installed down at the pier so it's a global initiative whereas you put your cell phone into the frame and you take a photo of the exact same location each time to see the differences in the coast it's really helpful because at the moment the coast has been accreting severely and if you look at the pipelines along the beach at the moment which is storm water pipelines they're about 75 centimetres under sand so they're actually blocking up with sand that will actually suck most of the sand away and clear it out um the site visit to south brighton surf life saving club this is awesome kelly and I went down and we got shown through by rowan mcnaughton and brand new facility nice big community space they've got such a good look out over the beach and a big community space where they hopefully will have some events held there um hire it out to people that want to use it for like an exercise room they've even got an elevator inside there which is pretty flash for a safe club um with these you can see they've got a little bit of car parking around the side and a new tarsil and they're really thankful that the road adjacent along marine parade has actually all been sealed again it's looking lovely but they're still working on trying to get the bit between the road and the new ceiling done because it's a wee bit rugged from the construction so it's looking fantastic and it's very exciting to see peer-to-peer race this was on last weekend and you can see our very lovely mc james daniels there helping out for the day um I actually went in and did the walk and everyone else ran but it was a wonderful event and the peer-to-peer race actually used to be held in new brighton for years and years and then just after the earthquakes they cancelled it and it hasn't been held since so this is reintroducing it and trying to get it up and going again it wasn't very well supported probably due to the fact that the city to surf was before but the event was a wonderful thing for the area because every entrant got a ten dollar voucher to actually use at new brighton on the day and five dollars of that was actually put in by the club and five dollars from the actual shop it was used there so um a good initiative and something to try and keep moving in the area um other things that have been happening in the area just last weekend the new brighton rugby club which year centenary celebration and it was really really well supported there was cars parked for miles and really good to see um the board also visited terraranga which is kingsley um and we had we were shown through and we're trying to reconnect with the community and seeing how we can help out with that community so it was really lovely to actually go there and be welcomed and be shown around and see what we can do for them yep and that's it well I'm sure phil will want to move that and I'll second it in the absence of mr daniels who who did excuse himself and he has a personal reason for not being here so thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carrie thank you very much and um finally he would community board and I do apologize bridget it's it was actually me making you last because this is your first time here as the chair of um of the community board so um you know patience no that's awesome and we're looking forward to hearing from you thank you sounds good no I know everyone might be paying for some morning today so I'll whip through this um and I have the lovely marianne here beside me as well just to help as well but yes so um I guess an activity that happened in our award was the election um for a new chair and so very exciting to be taking on the role um but also very grateful and excited to have david cartwright as our deputy chair as well so it's great that we can continue working as an effective team and while he's not here he is here in spirit and so I'll say a massive thank you to david um for everything that he's done as chair moving on to the next item is the draft ltp community engagement so the board has been out and about holding information stalls and providing people with the opportunity to get the consultation document and the submission form and also to talk to the local elected going out to where people are obviously is a way better result than holding drop-in sessions which where people are expected to come so it's about us getting out in the community and we've been going out to bishop dale new world fiddleton library northwoods new world and avon head mall and people have been stopping and talking to us which is great uh with a range of issues which we've listed there so things like library closing hours cycle ways traffic issues bus services and the representation review there were a ranging views on various topics and we are encouraging people to make sure they do a submission we also had our school principals meeting so the board had a great meeting on the 12th of march with all of the local school principals in the area not everyone could come obviously principals are incredibly busy but it was great to have them there those that did come along and safety issues regarding traffic around the schools was a big hot topic so the board has asked councils traffic staff to work with us in the also raised around the protection around the protection of trees which are on some of the grounds of the schools and there was a bit of frustration from the schools around the bureaucracy and red tape in regards to having work done to the trees so we will follow this up with council staff allen vale school is a provider of education to children and young people with special needs and they talk to us about the transition to work program that they have for their older students which is a great program but with the impacts of covert 19 on local businesses and employers they've seen a reduction of opportunities that are normally available to their young people um and of course there's also the exciting building project underway in our area as well bringing together the burnside primary common intermediate and allenvale school into one of the new campus on ireland road and the schools were deemed rebuilds following the earthquake so this project has been a long time coming so it's really exciting we also had a styx living a site visit sorry to of people doing outstanding work um on learning and research in the styx river catchment so although their bases in the hayward ward the work they undertake spans across the papanoi innis and coastal burwood areas as well but on this recent site visit board members were able to hear a lot about the work they're doing in regards to water quality monitoring restoring and protecting natural habitats and ecosystems predator control and the reintroduction of native species they run regular volunteering events including a monthly bird monitoring program to record the number of individual water bird species and they also run school education programs and summer student research scholarships for tertiary students so we're so grateful for the amazing work that they do in the area and lastly we also had the pleasure um to sit down and have a chat with sarah pallett who is the new mp for ireland so nearly 90 percent of the islam electorate is within the final tournament he would board area and we talked about some of the key issues in the area and there was a real keen desire issues particularly those that require central government action and I think it's just a really great example of us wanting to collaborate and um catch up regularly so I'm sure we'll be seeing more of sarah in the future so yeah if you have any questions happy to take them thank you no I presume sam you'd like to move this and james would like to second it are there any questions any discussion are you going to get away with it I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you thank you very much thank you so much great work right we'll adjourn now for morning tea um and if we could be back here at um half past that's 12 minutes enough time to grab a coffee thank you thank you everyone thank you thank you uh we're we're actually going to go to item 18 uh so that we can address the naming of the metro sports facility um and that is because we have lynn tayaka who the matapuri representation on the on the gifting of the name so that's very much appreciate appreciated so thank you lynn for being here as well so I'll hand over to you and um craig hutchings I'm the facility establishment manager at council and I'm joined by um lin tayaka who's representing mata popery the purpose of this report for council is to consider a permanent name for metro sports facility which is currently the working title for the new recreation and sports facilities being constructed between morehouse road and antigua street while the report contains all the background information regarding the name and the rationale for the recommendation I would just like to take a moment to reinforce the link between the special name that local renault and taina tahereh have gifted as the largest recreation and sports facility in new zealand this facility will encourage and promote physical wellbeing for all cantabrians support pathways for high performance athletes and importantly increase participation rates in sport and recreation the story of parikhyori the gift and name which I will shortly pass over to lynn use of recreation and sport as descriptors are important as they communicate the purpose of the facility recreation being activities done for enjoyment and not outside of work sport being activities being involved in physical exertion and skill in which people usually compete against each other these words together para kuyori recreation and sports center will provide meaning build a sense of pride in cultural identity and inspire the millions and customers that will visit the facility when it opens and I think an important part of that is the education of the the name so I'll pass over to lynn and um we'll actually start that process and and lynn will we'll take you through some of that story uh everyone I'm here as a face of matapupuri but also from and I'm a trustee of the marae and thinking about our name and I give apologies from our upo called te maideto who's actually on muttonbird islands at the moment seasonal food gathering but he was the one who actually came up with the name and I'll just walk you through we'll go through it so the metro sports facility promotes sporting excellence in physical wellness from a maori perspective it also links to physical strength and agility and these are all part of the core narrative thread of wellbeing traditional maori existence demanded high physical ability of men and women alike to survive the transient subsistence way of life within the southern landscape and to survive as warriors physical and mental excellence is celebrated through the many traditional narratives that tell of the relationship between maori and the environment and independent interdependence of both for continued health and wellbeing one such narrative from ahuriri tells the story of resilience determination and agility it is summarised in its simplest form in the following slides tu dakotahi was the founding chief of kaiapoipa fungitu in the north canterbury area in the 1700s so he's our main ancestor from the time nighter who set foot in the south island one of his sons was named parakiyori and he was known for his prayers his agility and quick thinking he was embroiled in a battle on the moiraki beach the invaders were moiraki beach where their pursuers caught up with them they taunted him about his supposed fleetness of foot and how easy he had been to catch parakiyori was not concerned and replied with a cryptic remark when the tide recedes the taurier the oyster catcher will strike the flecks of hinuka kai boone's the above pipihal for katoki was recited by parakiyori it was a boast that they were never going to catch him because he was too fast for him the probe from parakiri tells us that his speed was the same as again as in a spark igniting dried flax maori would use dried flax as a fire starter and like the taurier the oyster catcher if parakiyori had moved too soon he would have been slowed down by the surf and the tide washing onto the sand so you actually have to know the environment and the landscape too to survive well in in the landscape he then promptly lifted his wife onto his back and piggybacked her down the beach so quickly that he still outran his pursuers so this is naitahu story of endurance the 18th century and his proverb has been handed down from generation to generation the story of parakiyore also tells the significance of understanding and understanding the environment we live in and our interdependence on the flora and fauna by becoming eco-literate about learning to read our environment visually and the physical landmarks and iconic features within our environment gives gifts this name for the metro sports facility gilda any questions I think thank you very much for the presentation because it really does um provide a sort of a compelling story uh around around the name and uh and and and the understanding of that significance of of knowing our environment um but my question is is really for for our staff member because um uh councillors um obviously had had a bit of a background briefing on this and there was a feeling that the word metro shouldn't disappear because it has become such a feature of the of the um of the place itself it isn't a a local suburban community facility it is the metropolitan centre and uh and there was a question as would be an acceptable um name I i just think that metro in my view the branding and and we did as part of the document we we did consider that as an option uh at looking at um retaining that metropolitan and I understand that it is a regional based facility and all you know as opposed to our local attractions but um from a branding perspective it becomes quite difficult from a signage perspective it becomes quite difficult and I think in the the activities that are provided and the services are provided uh and an understanding that will attract regional and national events the understanding what the facility is actually serving as a purpose will actually be achieved through through the services and programs and activities that and events that that are provided as opposed to having to be part of the name well if that just makes it very long then metro sports center because then I mean metro sports centre actually less letters and and from the from the incredible activities that it will attract like national competitions and and potentially international or trans tasman place it's the sports activities that will will be the the stand out of this facility as opposed to the recreation um um respectfully the the the facility um yes a component of of it will be about sport um but but importantly for cantabrians and the key purpose one of the key objectives is to increase sport um people's participation and actually people um the the attraction in terms of recreation as as explained before in things that are not competitive and are not uh do don't involve people competing against each other the hydro slides the leisure the the the leisure water the aquatic sensory area spaces the fitness spaces there are so many spaces it's unfair it's unfair because I thought that we'd we'd had a discussion about this the other day um and that this obviously wouldn't have been a surprise yep uh so I'm just I'm just getting a sense from uh councillors if if people are generally comfortable with what's up there um uh and the alternative is the is the parakiyori I um the gift gratefully received um but the the word metro is what people have understood about this place it is our premium premier event centre really for um for both swimming and but anyway um if there's a general feeling that um that that's not the case um I'm happy to foreshadow then um the metro sports centre if that's sure because I think that'd be far more appropriate I think that one of the things that um I mean I think that people will probably still continue in some ways to call it metro sports like they call turanga and the central library those kind of things I think that if we add metro sports as part of the official name what we risk is people just dropping the parakiyori part of it when they are naming it um where that should be the formal name um sorry I look we did have a discussion about this the other day and yes it was an informal discussion and I i may have misunderstood the extent of people's views I thought I was okay tim I'm not no perna why is known by everybody as naipurna why so I just think we kind of get overthinking and start with especially the european things a whole lot of names like the the recreation and sports centre I mean that's so boring let's be honest but everyone knows it's metro sports but if we had parachute metro sports I mean it's just everyone knows it's symmetra we've been talking about it for almost 10 years and we gift the name as a real treasure so I think to just keep it as simple as possible possible recreation sport everyone knows it's recreational sports so metro sports so I think the gifted name with metro sports simple aaron yeah so uh well I just had a question if I can I still do a question it was around the um the story that was just told in all the words that went with it will that be in the foyer in that full form uh so we're we're working with mata poppy at the moment to video or um signage throughout the facility so so the answer is yes and there will be other ways to tell the story as well I can see a children's book a digital story that's that's told I can hear your voice telling it well I'm writing the box I'll let you know and and if it's if it's approved that there's you know there's there's a video piece that will come out and explain the story um as part of our uh our communications plan I'm happy to move this my recommendation there's something okay so it's been moved by aaron seconded by sarah so is there any debate I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry okay so that's carried thank you very much thank you um can we go back to the minutes for the audit and risk management committee uh move by sam uh seconded by sarah I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no by sam seconded by james I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried health cell health safety and well-being committee minutes take it take it as read happy to move james has moved them any questions I'm sorry any a seconder please sam mcdonald I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the next item is the draft submission on environment canterbury's long-term plan and the staff have um have added some additional text to address the points that we have been discussing both here at the meeting in relation to clean air and in terms of strengthening the wording also strengthening the wording around nitrates and ground water and and also at my request um an additional wording about the free shuttle because the free shuttle is something that our own residents have raised time and time again we've tried to get it included within the regional public transport plan it is there but there is the sense that it's the chicken and egg they built and we're saying no actually it needs to be there now because um that idea of making it easy to get around um in the central city um and and filling back that sort of bit of a gap in the doughnut um uh would would certainly help as well so um so we've got this do we want to go through perhaps if I just hand over to staff and you talk about the the changes because everyone has seen and thank you for such a speedy turnaround yes that's no trouble um if I'd known you're going to put it on the screen I would have tidied it up a little bit more in the five minutes that we that we were um frantically working it just shows how quickly you've worked but to deal with the nitrate issue first at the top of the screen you can see the existing paragraph 18 and then the suggestion is that we strengthen that by adding in the middle of the paragraph that we are concerned to see rather than simply noting the we welcome clarification of the regional council strategy for addressing this emerging trend and then finally we suggest that increased monitoring would be clearly required once nitrate levels approach 50 of that maximum acceptable value and that wording at the very end makes the point that the mav is set in terms of short-term exposure and it's not a level um and that considers what happens if you're exposed over the long term um so there's sort of options in there for how so strong you want this paragraph to be in terms of raising these issues with all right sarah and you're not sarah you're pauline thank you I think we need to be really strong um my concern is that we do we do have a new zealand study going on at the moment on the um maximum allowable level being different from that set by who and a lot of research so I'm wondering if we could put something in about ecan being flexible about emerging evidence as it emerges around the um the lowering of the maximum allowable value because high and we know that particularly when you see evidence on the macro invertebrates which is down around 1.3 I just don't I think we're still sitting looking at 50 percent of the mav is still too high as far as we're concerned so yeah if we could find some wording about ecam being flexible around changing standards or levels we have um got this advice also from three waters so I'm just one we're just thinking about whether that's actually in the drinking water standard so we just need to check that with helen um but we can certainly put something in there about flexibility I think it might be responding to future changes yes exactly and that's what we've discussed it's about making sure that we're informed by that immediately research and responsive and flexible to that so we can because I mean 50 of value now at 11.3 is what 6.75 or something which is ridiculously high still but I mean we're in the right space so I mean we can get the sign off of to wordsmith it here I would like to change the words is set for short-term exposure to um has been established based on acute exposure so you know there's some technical tidy up that I've disclosed yeah and we've sort of just been um circulating it around diane and sarah and to make sure that we've got that really you just get we'll just get the word and tidy up so I don't I think that generally people are comfortable with the proposed changes in a general sense and I think the wording is sufficient for us to tidy up the wording before it um to go back to the resolution do you want to deal with the other two bits sorry do you want to deal with the other elements yeah you will deal with yeah paragraph five um oh yes no a paragraph will run through the res sorry carry on yes okay so just a um stop the the paragraph about the free um yeah did you want me to comment on that um so this is another book I would going on the screen our initial suggestion I guess is just to add those red words to the end of existing paragraph five to say in addition we support further work on the affordability of public transport as part of the review of bus fares including consideration of free services but we're after the shuttle in the central city it's the central city shuttle so if we could just put um and the reinstatement of the um of the free uh central city shuttle that would do so yeah okay sorry I don't understand no no and um the clean air so we understand that was raised in the public forum and wanted to point out the strengthened wording that we added to paragraph 32 following the staff briefing on the 26th of march when we met with councillors to discuss the draft submission the feedback we had then that was that that paragraph just wasn't strong enough and so we've added the red wording in there to the draft that you have attached to the report right so that people are generally comfortable with we heard this morning and I i mean I was kind of on the impression ecam were doing more in that quarry space but I think what we heard this morning is there's still huge gaps so I was a bit concerned with we support the steps they've taken to improve monitoring and air quality around quarries I just don't know how robust what they're currently doing is um and thought we may want to be stronger particularly around that but I mean I think fundamentally um we we do want to support a level of service so that people can see what the expected response time would be if they do log those complaints um and it's not just quarries it is it is dust as well um and I know um there's been some concern but I just also wanted to check on the on the free shuttle because previously we've been advised that we cannot be anti-competitive with existing contract providers so we can't run a service that's free where companies have contracts to deliver bus services run no service but obviously the bus routes have changed quite significantly the shuttle doesn't run on a an existing bus race sorry manchester street is the key bus it's not a it's not a scheduled service I just wonder like I suppose look I read the act it doesn't it complies okay that's good because when we tried to get an east west one we were repeatedly told that we couldn't do it because of that but I mean because they have scheduled services running east to west side north south as well but the other thing just in that regard is when we were doing the car parking um policy strategy the idea of for example three buses within the four abs like a zone zero so I just I mean I don't want to rule out that option as well because I think both deserve to be looked at but can we make it a little bit wider just to include the ability for people just to get on the bus within the you know go travel within the four hours be a better way of doing it but we don't obviously need to get advice on that but so we're generally comfortable with the direction of it we can wordsmith the final sign-off um and if you want to change it so that the final wording um agreed between the um the mayor and chief executive yeah I mean we'll just get advice on it but we'll just sign off the final wording and the second question is is does the council want this to be um hurden does it do they want the council to present the submission to ecan or are they quite happy that we just um forward the submission to them just forward it to them yep well that that's the thing is is that are we going to agree that it be heard in support of its submissions so I think we should be heard yes okay so um so so so andrew are you happy to move the approval and agree that it be heard and support and delegate oh you can't move it because it says the by melanie okay aaron yeah just the only question I had when I went through the whole thing was why did we not mention the incredible rates rise do you mean the 24 right we don't that's like saying that our council's budget's tiny compared to the government so I wasn't_''_9897.279 at the meeting where this was discussed but I think that it was made relatively clear that there was to be a um focus on the issues that is an issue because it's been that's about the only thing that's been raised with me by members of the public is yes I've read your posts it's not a question I mean the issues are in relation to the to to the um to to what they are doing so it's the it's the programs of work so as I understood you know counsellors were quite comfortable with going down that track if you want to um I'm sorry but some counsellors here who are not happy with us we're not at the workshop and so problem I don't care yes we we hadn't we had a workshop with um to discuss the questions with them I i wasn't at it so and I can comment I mean I led the pre-discussion before we met with the econ governors where everybody was comfortable that we wouldn't comment on the rates rise um and certainly that was the basis of the discussion with the econ governors and even though there was some discussion in that forum um the result was that the people in the the people in the room were comfortable that we wouldn't um make comment on the rates rise um and there was interesting information that was given by the econ governors at that meeting around the rates rise and the effect on christchurch residents versus the figure which has seen so much attention in the media I've just sent through to joe some wording potentially we could look to include okay well that can be put up as an amendment so um sorry yep um thanks so much I'm just thinking about the the types of outcomes that we're seeking and the issues that we've raised is the work that we have asked to be done and the focus that we have asked for from ecan which tends to be additional work is that likely to be consistent with a lower rates increase um when we've been asking for additional work can we see what I've done it's a question for staff actually thanks sam yeah but it would answer your question really easily yeah I've asked staff you usually ask for the stuff answer for the so sarah the question is that the feedback we've provided would that result in a lower rate is it because it consists of exactly no staff because they're obviously going to do as we are going to do a juggling exercise after we've listened to submissions um so I mean the reason that I don't support us making a submission on the rates rise but I do around the technical detail and I would have been quite happy for this merely to have been submitted but that but that don't um agree with us doing that is that that is an issue that will be discussed with ecan as a matter of course after hearing submissions from the residents who are going to be asked to make that so make those payments of their rates and so why should we collectively a group of individual rate payers which is what we would be here make a submission on that subject here I mean the the reality is is that we can't represent the view of the of the city or even an understanding of the view of the city given that there's going to be a juggling act made at the end about what the rate of implications will be so if it's easy to put it as amendment and then if it gets lost against us for goodness sake we're concerned by the proposed rate increases across the region noting that this will vary by ratable unit we would request that as elected members who direct environment canterbury staff to reduce this additional rating burden by finding further operational savings we believe a to talk about the rest of the region yeah it is it is an amendment but it's very rude well no but it's it is actually all responsible it's not it's not an appropriate amendment it's actually 24.5 for us as a council to make a submission um on this uh point when they are out hearing directly from their residents right across the region as we are for ours there will be a juggling act that will happen at the end of it where essentially the the weight of submissions will be considered people will look through all of the issues um I mean if the if the um if the if this simply said that we note that all of us are operating at times of um that require fiscal restraint uh due to the challenges that we all face then I'm good with that but I think asking um the environment canterbury uh members to do this in the context of the um broader responsibility I just don't think that it's it's not our role to speak on we can't_''_10239.92 be concerned about stuff across the region we're only concerned about ourselves anyway um I don't know I look I'm gonna I'm going to adjourn journalist item and I'm going to take advice as to the um legality and appropriateness of the amendment I don't care I want legal advice I want proper advice as to the nature of this amendment because I believe that we are not under the local government act able to actually put that amendment um to the council um today so um if if I could just uh I think I'll just move on to the next item on the agent I'll just let this lie on the table until we get I'm just going to join this item and come back to it in a minute but if you could just get me some advice on that we'll just move into the central city projects high street cashel chum and high street tram extension this is a technical document yes moved by jake seconded by james any discussion I'll put there any spare traffic light poles because we like to up cycle in our wood that we could move to herewood road coming out just in the interest of um saving materials yes noted brilliant thank you um yani you're not going to move on to the items on the px paper are you I put some questions through um I really just wanted to understand around the um the just the whole traffic modeling for the new state multi-use arena that's the next item sorry that is not an item that we're dealing with on this matter these are the decisions that we have already made as a council these are the technical amendments um or resolutions that have to be passed to implement yeah okay but there's changes so if you go to page 162 okay I'm just not going to put up with this anymore I've said to you that is an item to be dealt with in the next this is our commenting section of the agenda my question relates to 5.5 which is in the public section of this what's not fair about it being raced item 5.2 so there were 5.5 item 5.5 on the honest agenda it's to do with the detail under section 5. there's a number of changes that have been um advised to us and there's a number of comments around things being either further investigated as part of future work yep so there are no changes as a result of 5.4 or 5.5 we are just advising the council that the hearings panel resolution for us to undertake this will be undertaken we haven't forgotten about it and it is being done it's part of future work that is planned as part of the ltp yeah what I was trying to understand though in terms of this design what thinking has gone in to the impact of the new multi-use arena because if you go down manchester straight like clearly what we thought was going to happen I mean I've talked to bus drivers who've got delays the traffic's not working as I thought it would and as we thought would be we've this was designed in putstro as part of a design we knew the multi-use arena was in the future and we have done that the the I've lost a word sorry that how that intersection will um run run work in the future as part of a picture project which is in the draft ltp yeah yeah so that's been asked and answered I'm not having any badgering thank you um is there any other point I'm gonna might I will we're in debate I will support this uh because it's just the technical resolutions on the decision that council made last term so I will say you stood but I do think as a council we missed a huge opportunity to get some really excellent outcomes to high street and I think the compromise we did was actually too much yeah okay I'll speak to it as well cool yeah um like I think if you take a high level view there's been a lot of changes that have been done we've put some transitional stuff along ferry road we of some of the potential developments as well as some new developments and I think you know fundamentally we can't just keep putting in projects that were done as part of the accessible city or the inaccessible city um we can't just keep doing them like we actually need to take a stock take of how the traffic is functioning in the central city from my observation and from people I've talked to there's a lot of dysfunction with things that were supposed to work in a certain way that aren't there's probably some really good stuff that is working well but clearly I think with the amount of development going on particularly with a new multi-use arena where we've just got additional funding on our ltp that we're consulting on we should actually think about really good connections for cycling and pedestrians as a big picture rather than just doing each little block on a block block-by-block basis so my concern is that there seems to be a lack of an integrated traffic pedestrian cycling planning for this whole quadrant of that would be beneficial like manchester straight I mean I've talked to bus drivers who said they spent 15 minutes sitting in gridlock because a few cars get in into the middle of manchester street clearly that's not a functional uh priority for pt and nora do I think it's functional for people that are accessing the city so I'm not going to support this today I think we're missing an opportunity to look at the big picture uh I think things have moved on since the accessible city plans were put in place um and we actually need to step back and think about the community of impact of all the proposed development or existing development that's happened in this area since and come up with a bit much better coordination thank you I don't think it's actually too much to worry about because because of three anonymous complaints over two years with regards to the gravel car parks and it seems to be a want around this uh table to get rid of them there'll be less traffic anyway those in favor say aye those opposed say no no yeah I'm opposed thank you that's carried we'll move on to the next next item public street enclosures policy level four enclosure applications I'm really happy to move this seconded by andrew any discussion totally I didn't give him an answer sorry sorry you're asking question on the riverside market yeah I put some questions on the head of the meeting yesterday sorry I haven't um sorry richard you're at the end of the table I presume that you've got yanI's questions jani would you like to share your questions with richard please so um the three questions I had were I was just wondering like um obviously the real side market's fantastic it's really popular and well used I was just trying to understand I wasn't quite clear from the report around that the paving that's there um who who takes responsibility for the maintenance so I was trying to understand does our maintenance budget get reduced and they pick up the cost of maintaining get additional revenue that then goes into maintaining it I wasn't clear on that that was probably the biggest concern but the other concern was just to understand from a value add point of view to the development um I i guess what that does in terms of rentable space does it enable more space to be rented at a higher value and is our charging in accordance with that or how do we work out what's a fair assessment answer to the second question is yes we do charge them for that the same as we charge anyone else um I can't speak to how we go about doing that but it's a consistent charge across the central city for people who are using part of the public space whether it be roads or something else right so yes we do charge them for that but the concern obviously this is quite different to what's currently permitted in our policy this structure is more significant the charge is still the same as I understand it but it's not dissimilar to what you'd different because you haven't got the um you haven't got the two and a half metre space adjacent to the terraces however when you look at where the buildings finish and then the enclosures go into the oxford terrace area that's not dissimilar to what this might look like but the point I'd like to stress in this is that these are conceptual plans and we're still working through exactly what the final designs might look like with the riverside representatives so hence the reason why we've sought that council delegate authority to the head of transport as opposed to because these things might be modified through discussions with riverside reps so um it's conceptual um will look something like this but but perhaps not exactly the same and the the maintenance issues so in terms of maintenance we maintain um oxford terraces it's it's part of the transport network so um it falls under the heaps to the central city streets so we'll fall into their contract for doing that we do have a an agreement abroad agreement with we do other parts of the central city so we work collaboratively with them and others to ensure that you know we get the best outcomes for the city is sorry is this the section that they are leasing or have a license to occupy will will basically come under their maintenance regime so I presume that's a part of the that we're not current that we wouldn't maintain so in terms of um they're safe for rubbish and other things so we manage the rubbish bins which is the outside we've got some big belly type bins out there plus some normal bins we manage those they would manage something like rubbish which is left on their table so that's something that they would do so there's components that they would manage and there's components that we would make I guess what I was really interested in is it's very expensive paving that's been put down here yep and just to ensure that there's adequate maintenance occurring and the stuff that's licensed to occupy but obviously it it needs to probably include I think we had to depreciate it I'm not sure but I know at the time there was concern raised about the cost ongoing cost of maintenance so I just would hope that that's factored into whatever agreement and maintenance regime has put in place so in terms of what we charge them as a as I mentioned we'll be charging them the same as we do other central city businesses who occupy public space um in terms of maintaining that the transport asset underneath that that would still fall within our obligation however if they were to damage that then that would be a conversation that we would have with them thanks thanks for clarifying that my thank you um I think you know the conceptual drawings are good but you know is this actually the reality of what we're going to see and I guess under this level they can actually have it fully enclose this public space so look the the as we've tried to outline in the report um the outdoor dynasty is regulated by the policy 2006 that policy is currently up for review the way that policy is structured is you have levels one two and three which are delegated to head of transport or the ce so this is what we call a level four enclosure because it doesn't fit within the policy and hence we are seeking council approval so that is something where it may be fully enclosed but I don't believe that that is their intention and as that's part of the conversation we need to have with the riverside representatives uh about what parts of it would be fully enclosed if indeed they are so the intention would be that from their perspective you know if you look at towards this direction so to the west um they might want that fully enclosed for parts of the year or parts of the day you know particularly when there's inclement weather and so that to provide for outdoor dining but there's going to be foot traffic between the building per se and the outdoor dining area across the 2.5 metre strip so you wouldn't discussion that we need to have with them about their intent the south part I think you know in northern parts are slightly different again so um but to answer your point around yes does it enable that that would be the intention of the council delegation to the head of transport today and that would be the detail that we would uh negotiate with the riverside reps about the how and the when and what would it look like sarah question thanks um from the drawings which look gorgeous it does look like the um there's a significant narrowing of that just normal pedestrian thoroughfare kind of space um once you've got a sort of more permanent kind of structure there that's still technically a drivable space too and I'm assuming loading vehicles and things will be coming in within the set hours um what risk is there to damage to uh not just the estrogen but people but the um the you know the rain gardens those kind of things we often see you know the qualified trees have been knocked by a truck council has to ratepays have to pay for it and with the significant narrowing what are the risks to that kind of stuff so you're not talking about the 2.5 millistrip adjacent to the building itself you're talking about the um the four metre area slowly to the west of where they want the outdoor dining yeah so look um we really don't want vehicles it is a public road but we don't want vehicles going through there because it is heavily pedestrianised and and sometimes there's quite a bit of pedestrian other furniture there from riverside yeah there is loading spaces outside on litchfield street so we encourage um the loading of goods and for that to occur on litchfield street as opposed to because it's very close to riverside and they can get access around the back as opposed to trucks driving up and down that strip it's not something we try and encourage but at the moment council's having that conversation around oxford terrace and what hours it is currently open and um that'll be a decision of will be open for delivery vehicles um because at the moment it's quite but this particular section is much narrower it is narrower especially with the new structure and stuff in um that that that four metal strip will still be kept as a as a four meter strip so you know vehicles could still negotiate it but but it is certainly getting very busy when you look at all the other stuff which is potentially spilling out onto it so look it's not something we encourage but currently um you know they can legally use that so I'm just concerned that if you get to the point of actually enclosure there's nowhere for pedestrians to go there's the rain gardens on one side there's a an enclosure on the other side and a truck going past there's no way for them to actually move either side yeah so you've still got the two and a half metre strip adjacent to the building and then you've got the ag rock adjacent to that if it's enclosed you can't get's still walkway they'll still the whole area wouldn't be enclosed there'd be walkways along there yeah okay it'll be a sheltered walkway right well um we'll move on to the debate and I'll open that up I was actually looking forward to this item on the agenda more than any other item on the agenda today it has a very practical application which it says this doesn't qualify for policy under our existing policy so can you please delegate it to the head of transport to decide whether to approve the licence go for it richard you've got my full blessing I just think that it's a fantastic thing riverside has transformed the central city it has made it an exciting destination amazing place to go and uh and I i went past there um over the easter weekend and uh it was just jam-packed with people there were thousands of people poured into the area just enjoying themselves on a beautiful beautiful hot sunny weekend so I i just am incredibly grateful to what richard peebles and mike pikeski I trust the organisation to do the right thing in relation to this licensing arrangement it's an important decision but it's one that can be made by delegation and that's going to make it a much more direct relationship between the organisation and the riverside market and that's going to make a real difference so thank you very much for the paper uh tim and then sarah yeah just for a moment there I kind of thought you know like listening to the questions why would you do business in christchurch but um I'd have to say this is fantastic I totally agree with the mayor um and I think it's best left with staff and now good luck I think it's going to be contested yeah and the thing is like I completely agree my um my concerns over the the impact are to do with the volume of cars down there so outside in the space on oxford terrace there used to be a lot of on-street car parking and um riverside is one of the best examples in the entire the on-street parking because you get a much greater pedestrian amenity you know this was built in a space where they knew that there would be no on-street car parking there's off-street car parking available nearby and it really does show the contrast about what is possible when you focus on people and people space and it really highlights the lost opportunity that we have just seen in high street so andrew andrew yeah thank you um yeah if there's if there's one thing that's been a game changer and the development of the central city is riverside and we see the um large number of people sitting out there outside there on the grass and chairs and tables and consuming food that they've bought from riverside and generally enjoying themselves and creating an excellent atmosphere right in the heart of the central city if there's one thing that we know about christchurch it's that it's a city with four seasons and that we know outdoor dining operates very differently in the winter than it does in the summertime which involves the can be heating shelter and so on um I'm sure that under the delegation that we're giving richard assuming this passes he will fully take into account um any conflict between or any opportunity for um pedestrian cyclists and motor vehicle movements and I absolutely agree that what we are doing here is creating a space for people but certainly listening to the answers to questions there should be space for all of those activities to take place safely at the same time as making this an attractive year-round destination for outdoor dining and outdoor use so I'm excited about this but I also understand the concerns very confident richard that you will take account of all of the things that have been raised as you exercise the delegation that hopefully we're about to give you um mike and then who was the other one just thank you and look on face value when you look at what's in front of us the conceptual drawings it actually looks like a really good outcome I am concerned of actually what potentially it could become once you guess seen a creep of you know private business taking over the public realm which does concern me um and then also the adverse effect of actually starting to squeeze more people into a smaller corridor and what actually affect that that will have so I like what's in front of me but I am very concerned about actually where this could be heading for for the city um and pauline um I i the riverside guys have created a fantastic asset for christchurch and if we can help for the whole city and if we can help them by delegating richard this to do this I just think um go go hard it's good so more and faster pauline I agree this and the way they've thought out this design including the movable planters and and the lighting and the the louvers it'll open and close I just think that they do things really well um I think I'm happy to delegate it to richard because he seems like a pretty reasonable sort of bloke here so I think you'll do it all and jerry's if you haven't tried the vegan ice cream you're missing out on something it is amazing so I'll be supporting this today okay erin yeah I'll be supporting it and I would encourage you to try the um cherry garcia rather than the vegan it's the better ice cream uh but that aside um picking up on mike's point um if this is what business creeping into the public space looks like let's hope that happens a lot more around the city because there's a lot of dead public space right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much on to the mayor's monthly report it's unlike usual it actually has a couple of additional recommendations with it this month a request for an endorsement for the nomination of principal advisor community partnerships and planning um claire phillips to the royal commission inquiry implementation oversight advisory group which is an advisory group to the government and also adopting the resolution just based name change to venue's oto tahi in my report I've done what I've what I always do which is highlight some of the features of the month but because it was the month of march it was in the it was um it's in retrospect um I won't go over um any of those details I have used the v based change of name though to highlight uh the um the the major change that they have made to shift to uh local products so catering is all in-house now uh venus ototahi now sources 71 of all food and beverage product from the region previously it was only five percent um the remaining 29 of products are sourced from the rest of the south island seven percent from the north island um 16 and only six percent of products are now from overseas previously 30 percent of all products were from overseas so it's an incredible um turnaround um so in real terms this means 40 local suppliers to our local venues most of whom are new in the in the last really impressed with that and the one other thing that I'll draw your attention to is a fantastic launch that I went to the other night in common and that directly arises out of the events of the 15th of march 2019 and as you know the royal commission has asked us to think deeply about what creates social cohesion and there's a group of people and claire's been amongst them have worked on right across agencies right across communities to develop this tool called in common and it encourages christchurch residents to reach out across cultures and faiths to make canterbury a better place where everyone feels that they belong and and if you go on to the website you'll see some lovely little stories with images of people um you can see some of them in the and what I presented here today but but actually when they get together it's what they have in common that uh is the conversation starter and uh it's a it's a great um tool really for um developing those conversations so I I've spread it far and wide because it's a it's just a great opportunity for us to to do something about um you know valuing our differences which make us unique but valuing all that we have in common as well so um so I'm happy to move my uh report plus the additional recommendations and does you're happy to second it jimmy chen anyone quit questions or debate comments yep I kind of it just um sort of say thanks for um taking the time to write really full reports on your mural activities I know that um you're probably the first mere to do this kind of mirror report and it's it's really valued and highlights a wide range of things that are um often unseen by us or by others and there's a huge number of additional events and things that you go to on the city's behalf so just want to say thanks wasn't expected aaron oops yeah I endorse um sarah's words there um because yeah you do do a lot of work and you stuff um a bit nerdy but it's one of those things you said you like reading it um I just want to bring up or add to point three up there it was your suggestion that you put nominate claire and the entire table when we had that briefing supported that and were just almost overwhelmed that that was the person that you put forward and chose there's an incredible amount of respect around this table for claire and the work she does in our community and she is one of the young unsung heroes of this city that has taken this city through one of its darkest points so thank you thank you phil thank you jimmy uh based on mayor's report I think the paragraph three is very very important I mean the kind of strong signal you know all kinds of particular criteria city council you know we would like to in response to the royal commission their inquiry the report and the 44 recommendations and the clear ferris over the last possibly at least 20 years not only in council but in the also engage wider communities what we in those name you know is I think there is a greater benefit to our council regarding to the the bicycles particularly emphasized you know still would like to embrace all kinds of the the people you know can be joined together in order to in response to help the government for the implementation government implementation uh the plan et cetera it's not a crude only one person just want to let everybody know the other one is particular riverside market you know they they done a great job because while they particularly have in their the level one specific area a lot like to the encourage as a community group they might have a function event you know activity in there I i myself I attend those function events for of even over the last months three three three times you know like irania the new year japanese one and also the the encounter they done a great job so I think possibly you know it was some uh coming community a business down the great job I suggest whether council consider so just encouraging you know that's very very crucial because what we always emphasize this city is a diversified inclusive the the the harmonious city but they want to you know fully the into the quality's compliance totally with the council the community outcome resilient community that's fantastic also there's school of patent this is my view thank you so I could tell the oh sorry I was going to close the um the debate I was just going to add that clear is a fantastic choice for this role because of her knowledge and experience um in the muslim community but the fact that she's built up such trust and she knows um what's important to those people and so I think it's a wonderful recommendation and very supportive I'm just going to close off because I just noticed who hadn't actually read the report when jimmy started talking about the riverside market so on page 20 I refer to the fact that over the last year riverside market has supported community events as part of the cultures of ototahi been to most of them I think jimmy's been to all of them and his idea of actually recognizing the riverside market um that they actually did receive a presentation in common um for the launch of uncommon there the other night but I think we should we too should so I will take that as an action and bring that back in the next report because I think we should honour them uh for what they've done and um and uh I was going to say too that um claire's nomination was supported from members of the muslim community of brief families so I just wanted to make the point that this is a community-wide support for her so thank you very much for the comments that you've made and they will be passed on to her so I will put the motions all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you and now we will return to the fixed question of the draft submission on environment canterbury's long-term plan because disappointingly for me I've been told healthy for democracy and um if there's a second no there will be a second I'm sure who would like to second it aaron once sam gave him a nudge across the table he was happy to debbie nothing like a bit of a passive pressure from the chair either was that I was I was expecting it anyway um so um but and and you are absolutely wedded to the words because I mean ian did suggest that you know um asking elected members to direct environment canterbury staff too when they employ one person um is it it isn't it isn't quite would you like to suggest william has suggested yeah I mean it's just it's just a slight modification I'm not going to support it anyway but no no you've made that very clear but what well what what's the wording system yeah I was just going to suggest that instead of directing environment canterbury staff to reduce the rating burden replace that was you consider reducing this additional rating burden you just put it through as um so we've got a um we've got the it's been moved and seconded and the amendment has been moved and seconded so um I'll open it up for debate and I'll have debate um across the the two yeah I kind of get the the gist of the word without question but I think it's very hard for us to direct another organization staff and on so I do sympathise and agree with the sentiment but I can't support it with regards to directing others and so I mean just to clarify because it's a possibility we're in debate no I am I'm just clarifying what you were saying and your passive sort of cheering around it but when it says we would request that's that's a consideration that's not directing elected members at ecan that's saying we would request you to consider it so I don't really see why people would get wound up on it I mean the whole point of this is that we've had public backlash over the fact prepared to drive greater operational efficiencies and I think we should be as a council as sending some form of direction on behalf of the rat powers of our constituencies who do raise it with us I was at avon head mall yesterday on our long-term plan who were concerned equally at some of the stuff we're doing but also around ecan so I don't think it's unreasonable to put something like this to them they can reject it you know we don't listen to every submission that comes through uh we probably don't listen to most of them but but you know in the end I think we can send our view down so I don't think this is unreasonable in the slightest andrew uh sarah melanie thank you um I think we need to take this in context um yes there's been quite a lot of publicity about it around the um 24 rates rise that he can uh um proposing it is just a proposal it's out for public consultation um we know from the workshop we had with percent um rates rise christchurch is the area that we should be considering our role is to represent the people of christchurch not to represent necessarily the people of all of canterbury um to to quote something that somebody else might normally say in this room 24 percent of what we're coming off a low base 24 percent of a mouse is not 24 of an elephant um two very different things um coming off a very very low base um but I think we should be concentrating on what the people of christchurch would be interested in I think um a three percent rates rise on christchurch on christchurch particularly when we're considering in our own proposal of five percent rates rise ourselves there is a hypocrisy in asking econ to reduce their three percent rates rise when we're proposing a rate rise higher than that of our own um I also think um we should be concerned with the reality rather than the perception the 24 rate rise yes um will apply to some typically um owners of rural properties typically owners of large rural our district I'm not in favor of this I'm very comfortable with the position that we had taken as a council informally for those that were part of that discussion um which was that we wouldn't comment on the ecan rates rise and by return we're not expecting them to comment on ours so I'm very comfortable with the position that we'd already taken in informal discussions between ourselves and um environment canterbury where those that were in the room were obviously able to take part in those discussions sarah um I'll be voting against the amendment today and in favour of our full submission as it stands uh because I'm really keen for us to have an outcomes and an environmental issues focus and the rates that fall out of that fall out of that when we need when we look out of our when we look after our environment I completely get that council mcdonald's residents may approach him upset about the rates increase but residents are hosting meetings and protesting across our city on the issues they see meetings and protesting against the nitrates in the water across the region on air quality both from quarries and from composting in bromley these are the things that people say they want from ecan they want them to enhance their monitoring enhance their enforcement and they're also wanting them to follow the new government standards on a range of things as well this is what I'm hearing from residents who contact me this is what I see on the social media feeds and this is what I see from people actually gathering together and gathering a wider support base across the city in many meetings and protests and also what we've heard today thank you melanie um the same as sierra will be approving one and two and not the amendment um but I wanted actually to say um that we supported option one and to make that clear not to have any mention of the rates rise but because of what option one that eken is presenting is trying to achieve such as implementing you know investment into things like the government's essential fresh water space increasing frequency and selected routes moving to low and zero emission vehicles etc they also want to put more into biosecurity environmental restoration river works um and there's a whole there's so much stuff that they want to do that if you do for option if if we do if they do less then our environment will suffer and um yeah so the fiscal restraint in terms of the environment you've got to weigh those two things up and I think the environment's way more important than a couple of dollars to everybody every week um anyone else I've just aaron yeah I i will comment on this because I i don't think this is rude I think it's responsible that we uh comment on the rates um some people and you can speak of the mouse all you want but in my some parts of my neighborhood that's the size of a rat because we've got people paying more than two and a half grand uh four grand to e-cannon rates um the irony is paying fifteen hundred dollars as an interesting subsidy I that a 24 increase um should alarm anyone uh and as a council it's our job I think to speak up the fact that there was a secret meeting with a meeting without the public where a deal was done between the councils to not speak about it publicly should raise people's eyebrows as well oh does that not happen sorry no I'm just gonna I'm just gonna step in here because I'm not having that sort of assertion being made so um I thought I heard that no if you would if you would like to reframe that to a workshop between council council laws and council laws of christchurch city council and ecan as we meet with council laws of waimakariri district council as we meet with sohan district council but this was one with the environment canterbury councillors and it did discuss both of our long-term plans yeah okay so um then and obviously it was agreed that as a council we wouldn't speak about the rates rise which um no it wasn't agreed maybe unhelpful aaron please okay um then I'll just draw attention to uh some of the rate rises um like I saw in their chart that in 10 years time the spend on buses per year will be 150 million dollars which is a phenomenal uh amount of money when the increase so you're going to more than double the spend on buses but not double the patronage because even our own staff said that the bus usage will only go up by 40 so that there is a um essentially as an increase in the amount of carbon I realize that buses will be switching to electric but it's not certainly in the government's plan to have all vehicles electric by that time uh and they haven't yet the buses might be but at 750 000 per bus uh I don't think that's factored into their equations either so um we it is our role to comment on our fellow councils they can listen if they want but it is responsible for us to do that and at a time when inflation's upon the economy by ramping up taxes and this is another tax of 24 and yes it does come from a small base in some parts but in other areas it's not a small base it's it's an incredible amount of money that's more than a thousand dollars for some households thank you and I agree that it is our role to be responsible and to discuss and converse with our fellow councils but I also think it's important that we make informed comment about their work and what they're doing um I think it's about respect I haven't seen the in the chamber with my environmental and by ecan councillors and gone through the process that they've gone to to get to this point and um obviously we've heard that 24 is not the rate that's going to be um applied to the uh residents of the city um so it's about respect and I would expect the same back from them they haven't stayed with us through the hours and hours of of combing through the people of christchurch to give that feedback to them not us mike thank you um I support the um one two but not the amendment and and I guess um you know it's always little bit disappointing I guess when a number of councillors see a headline and run off to the media with their own we we story that actually get improper information about the impact it has on christchurch city people who were actually elected to represent had they got that information perhaps some of this misinformation that continually goes into the media would have been correct uh yani thank you um you know I i just wanted to pick up on the point that was made because we we sat here earlier and heard deputations from people extremely concerned about the impact of quarries and the lack of responsiveness I don't think we can really ask ecan to do things and then say actually we want you to cut funding towards those things um probably the issue of pt I mean in our submission we've actually talked about the fact that there is that money is going and I do think that's actually a real missed opportunity we need a much bolder transport vision that transforms our public transport in the city if we want people to use it and I just do personally feel that we're spending a lot of time on doing things that we've always done with slight tweaks rather than really being radical and if you look at the rail that's going up in auckland for example um I think there's a lot better systems that we should be looking at and considering but fundamentally um you know people actually want greater responsiveness from ecan around protecting the environment whether it's quarries whether it's the organics plant literally thousands and thousands of complaints go unanswered when it comes to our environment in our city because ecan do not have the resourcing to respond I want them to respond I want them to actually look after the health of our environment for the sake of our community wellbeing so I'm not going to support um the the amendment that's been put organisations to consider carefully how they how they spend money and to spend it in a wise and prudent fashion but I don't think it's fair to ask for them to do more and then turn around and say we want you to cut the funding I just want to comment on the submission itself I think it is really important that we do represent the interests of our constituents but we do have to make sure that what we do is within the bounds of what we can do and I get utterly frustrated when I see really good people from the community who turn up here looking for a solution that we can't offer them because of the restrictions or the implications or the boundaries set by the resource management act or by whatever functional separation there is between the different arms of government so many things that people come here for that are the decision of central government so many as we've heard today the the purview of um uh the the regional council and I it is frustrating that we end up debating the real serious challenging issues that we have as a as a city in the context of our regional council's long-term plan this is a submission on their long-term plan we've been asked to look at things like nitrates can you imagine what it would be like if nitrates were able to find their way into our aquifers all of the chlorine in the world doesn't protect us from nitrates can you imagine what the position of this city will be when a future council has to deal with the nitrates in the system within the aquifer system that is then um meaning that it has to be extracted in some in some way before it can be delivered at all so all I'm saying is is that there are serious issues that we do need to have to front up to there are matters within our own ltp which will generate significant debate and we have to debate them maturely and sensibly but focusing on one aspect of it a headline story doesn't cut the mustard it isn't what we are elected requires us to do we are required to think for the current generation but also for future generations as well and there are decisions that we are making now that will have an impact on decisions in the future it is the same for ecan let them make the decision around the rates implications of the final ltp that they sign off on and let us make the decision about the rates impact of the final ltp that we sign off on so on that note I will put the amendment all those in favor say aye can you put up your hands it's probably easier golf to mcdonald's major that's lost and um I oh sorry sorry those those opposed say no and I will put the full motion um those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that's carried and the same people oppose making submissions people will be interested yep thank you right yeah same so that is carried so thank you it's a million dollars for treason and uh so the last thing that I'm going to do that the public be excluded for the items on the agenda there is no one that needs to be included is there no and the um agenda sets out the reasons for um I'll move that secondary by pauline cotter any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried we will oh and opposed as yani and we will now adjourn for lunch and we'll be back here at 2pm thank you you
Um and we have uh some apologies today we've got um early departure from the mayor deputy mayor and councillor major um any other apologies not to have a mover for those sam secondary tim all those in favor please say aye declarations of interest for today no no um and confirmation of previous minutes do I have a movement for those jamie just minor correction uh item 13 of the minutes the wire fence one I think goff davidson mcdonald and chew ask that they vote against be recorded and so if you could pop that in aidan that would be great things it was a heritage wifi it was a heritage-wise my apologies yeah so with that um amendment um so we do add in some wearing at the minutes of the can't read that with the thing you've got them we don't need to make them the resolution no okay okay um so mover then jamie second up pauline all those in favor please say aye all right in against carried thank you very much and we
It's carried thank you and now we will return um to the uh fixed question of the draft submission on environment canterbury's long-term plan because disappointingly for me I've been told that I have to accept this dreadful amendment it's healthy for democracy and uh no there will be a second I'm sure who would like to second it once sam gave him a nudge across the table he was happy to apply nothing like a bit of passive pressure from the chair either was that I was I was expecting it anyway um so um but and and you are absolutely wedded to the words because I mean ian did suggest that you know um asking elected members to direct environment canterbury staff to when they employ one person um is it it isn't it isn't quite would you like to suggest what liam has suggested yeah I mean it's just it's just a slight modification I'm not going to support it anyway but no no you've made that very clear but what what what's the suggest that instead of directing environment canterbury staff to reduce the rating burden replace that was you consider reducing this additional rating burden you just put it through as it is we'll leave it as it is so um so we've got a um we've got the it's been moved and seconded and the amendment has been moved and seconded so um I'll open it up for debate and I'll have debate um across the the two yeah I i kind of get the the gist of the wording

would request um that's that's a consideration that's not directing elected members at it so I don't really see why people would get wound up on it I mean the whole point of this is that we've had

the environment's way more important than a couple of dollars to everybody every week anyone else I've just um aaron yeah I i will comment on this because I i don't think this is rude I think it's responsible that we comment on the rates um some people and you you can speak of the mouse all you want but size of a rat because um we've got people paying more than two and a half grand uh four grand to ecan and rates the irony is paying fifteen hundred dollars a year for a bus that's two kilometers away is is an interesting subsidy I that a 24 increase um should alarm anyone uh and as a council it's our job I think to speak up the fact that there was a secret meeting with a meeting without the public where a deal was done between the councils to not speak about it publicly should raise people's eyebrows as well oh does that not happen sorry no I'm just gonna I'm just gonna step in here because I'm not having that sort of assertion being made so um if you would like to reframe that to a workshop between council um council laws and uh council laws of christchurch city council and ecan as we meet with council laws of waimakariri district council as we meet with seowan district council but this was one with the environment canterbury councillors and it did then and obviously it was agreed that as a council we wouldn't speak about the rates rise which um no it wasn't agreed maybe if you've been here anyway anyway look it's unhelpful aaron please okay um then I'll just draw attention to some of the rate rises um like I saw in their chart that in 10 years time the spend on buses per year will be 150 million dollars which is a phenomenal uh amount of money when the increase so you're going to more than double the spend on buses but not double the patronage because even our own staff said that the bus usage will only go up by 40 so that there is a um essentially as an increase in the amount of carbon I realize that buses will be switching to electric but it's not certainly in the government's plan to have all vehicles electric by that time uh and they haven't yet the buses might be but at 750 000 per bus uh I don't think that's factored into their equations either our fellow councils they can listen if they want but it is responsible for us to do that and at a time when inflation's incredibly low we should not be forcing inflate faux inflation upon the economy by ramping up taxes and this is another tax of 24 and yes it does come from a small base in some parts but in other areas it's not a small base it's it's an incredible amount of money that's more than a thousand dollars for some households thank you and I agree that it is our role to be responsible and to discuss and and uh converse with our fellow councils but I also think it's important that we make informed comment about their work and what they're doing um I think it's about respect uh I haven't seen him in the chamber with my environmental and by ecan councillors and gone through the process that they've gone to to get to this point and um obviously we've heard that 24 is not the rate that's going to be um about respect and I would expect the same back from them they haven't stayed with us through the hours and hours of of combing through every line without ltp so it's up to the people of christchurch to give that feedback to them not us mike thank you um I support the um one two but not the amendment and and I guess um you know it's always a little bit disappointing I guess when a number of counselors see a headline and run off to the media with their own we we story fact actually getting proper information about the impact it has on christchurch city people who were actually elected to represent had they got that information perhaps some of this misinformation that continually goes into the media would have been correct uh oh yani thank you um you know I i just wanted to pick up on the point that was made because we we sat here earlier and heard deputations from people extremely concerned about the impact of quarries and the lack of responsiveness I don't think we can really ask ecan to cut funding towards those things um probably the issue of pt I mean in our submission we've actually talked about the fact that there is kind of a lack of visibility about where some of that money is going and I do think that's actually a real missed opportunity we need a much bolder transport vision that transforms our public transport in the city if we want people to use it and I just do personally feel that we're spending a lot of time on doing things that we've always done with slight tweaks rather than really being radical and if you look at the rail that's going up in auckland for example um I think there's a lot better systems that we should be looking at and considering but fundamentally um you know people actually want greater responsiveness from ecan around protecting the environment whether it's quarries whether it's the organics plant literally thousands and thousands of complaints go unanswered when it comes to our environment in our city because ecan do not have the resourcing to respond I want the health of our environment for the sake of our community well-being so I'm not going to support um the the amendment that's been put forward but I do think we should always be encouraging um organizations to consider carefully how they how they spend money and to spend it in a wise and prudent fashion but I don't think it's fair to ask for them to do more and then turn around and say we want you to cut the funding I just want to comment on the submission itself I think it is really important that we do represent the interests of our constituents but we do have to make sure that what we do is within the bounds of what we can do and I get utterly frustrated when I see really good people from the community who turn up here looking for a solution that we can't offer them because of the restrictions or the implications or the boundaries set by the resource management act or by whatever functional separation there is between the different arms of government so many things central government so many as we've heard today the the purview of the the regional council and I it is frustrating that we end up having these debates around um headlines and slogans instead of debating the real serious challenging issues that we have as a as a city in the context of our regional council's long-term plan this is a submission on their long-term plan we've been asked to look at things like nitrates can you imagine what it would be like if nitrates were able to find their way into our aquifers all of the chlorine in the world doesn't protect us from nitrates can you imagine what the position of this city will be when a future council has to deal with the nitrates in the system within the aquifer system that is then um meaning that it has to be extracted in some in some way before it can be delivered at all so all I'm saying is is that there are serious issues that we do need to have to front up to there are matters within our own ltp them maturely and sensibly but focusing on one aspect of it a headline story doesn't cut the mustard it isn't what we are elected to do it isn't what the local government act requires us to do we are required to think for the current generation but also for future generations as well and there are decisions that we are making now that will have an impact on decisions in the future it is the same for ecan let them make the decision around the rates implications of the final ltp that they sign off on and let us make the decision about the rates impact of the final ltp that we sign off on so on that note I will put the amendment um all those in favor say aye can you put up your hands it's probably easier goth to mcdonald's major and cure and those that's lost and I oh sorry sorry those those opposed say no that's lost um and uh I will put the full motion um those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that put up your hand for no no no people will be interested yep thank you right yeah same so that is carrie
Next item uh public street enclosures policy level four enclosure applications I'm really happy to move this seconded by andrew any discussion totally sorry you're asking a question on the riverside market yeah I put some questions on the head of the meeting yesterday sorry I haven't um sorry richard you're at the end of the table I presume that you've got yanI's questions yani would you like to share your questions with richard please so um the three questions I had were I was just wondering like um obviously the real side market's fantastic it's it's really popular and well used I was just trying to understand I wasn't quite clear from the report around that the paving that's there um who who takes responsibility for the maintenance so I was trying to understand does our maintenance budget get reduced and they pick up the cost of maintaining the expense of paving and if so or do we get additional revenue that then goes into maintaining it I wasn't clear on that that was probably the biggest a value add point of view to the development um I i guess what that does in terms of rentable space does it enable more space to be rented at a higher value and is our charging in accordance with that or how do we work out what's a fair assessment um answer to the second question is yes we do charge them for that the same as we charge anyone else I can't speak to how we go about doing that but it's a consistent charge across the central city for people who are using part of the public space whether it be roads or something else right so yes we do charge them for that but the concern obviously this is quite different to what's currently permitted in our policy this structure is more significant the charge is still the same as I understand it but it's not dissimilar to what you'd see outside the terraces for instance where the design is different because you haven't got the um you haven't got the two and a half metre space adjacent buildings finish and then the enclosures go into the oxford terrace area that's not dissimilar to what this might look like but the point I'd like to stress in this is that these are conceptual plans and we're still working through exactly what the final designs might look like with the riverside representatives so hence the reason why we've sought that council delegate authority to the head of transport as opposed to because these things might be modified through discussions with riverside reps so it's conceptual um will look something like this but but perhaps not exactly the same right and the maintenance issues so in terms of maintenance we maintain oxford terraces it's it's part of the transport network so um it falls under the heaps to the central city streets so we'll fall under their contract for doing that uh we do have a an agreement abroad agreement with with riverside around a whole range of different things as we do other parts of the central city so we work collaboratively with them and others um to ensure that you sorry the section that they are leasing or have a license to occupy will will basically come under their maintenance regime so I presume that's a part of the that we're not current that we wouldn't maintain so in terms of um they're safe for rubbish and other things so we manage the rubbish bins which is the outside we've got some big belly type bins out there plus some normal bins we manage those they would manage something like rubbish which is uh left on their table so that's something that they would do um so there's components that they would manage and there's components that we would make I guess what I was really interested in is it's very expensive paving that's been put down here yep and just to ensure that there's adequate maintenance occurring and the stuff that's licensed to occupy but obviously it needs to be of a certain standard or consistent and it needs to probably include I think we had to depreciate it I'm not sure but I know at cost of maintenance so I just would hope that that's factored into whatever agreement and maintenance regime has put in place so in terms of what we charge them as a as I mentioned we'll be charging them the same as we do other central city businesses who occupy public space um in terms of maintaining that the transport asset underneath that that would still fall within our obligation however if they were to damage that then that would be a conversation that we would have with them thanks thanks for clarifying that mike thank you um I think you know the conceptual drawings are good but you know is this actually the reality of what we're going to see and I guess under this um level they can actually have it fully enclose this public space so look as we've tried to outline in the report um the outdoor diner is regulated by the by the public places bylaw on the public street enclosures policy 2006. that policy is currently up for review the way that policy is structured is you have levels one two um ce so this is what we call a level four enclosure because it doesn't fit within the policy and hence we are seeking council approval so that is something where it may be fully enclosed but I don't believe that that is their intention and as that's part of the conversation we need to have with the riverside representatives uh about what parts of it would be fully enclosed if indeed they are so the intention would be that from their perspective um you know if you look at towards this direction so to the west um they might want that fully enclosed for parts of the year or parts of the day you know particularly when there's inclement weather and so that to provide for outdoor dining but there's going to be foot traffic between the building per se and the outdoor dining area across the 2.5 metre strip so you wouldn't really want that part fully enclosed so that's a discussion that we need to have with them about their intent the south part I think you know in northern your point around yes does it enable that that would be the intention of the council delegation to the head of transport today and that would be the detail that we would uh negotiate with the riverside reps about the how and the when and what would it look like sarah question thanks um from the drawings which look gorgeous it does look like the um there's there's a significant narrowing of that just normal pedestrian thoroughfare kind of space um once you've got a sort of more permanent kind of structure there um that's still technically a drivable space too and I'm assuming loading vehicles and things will be coming in within the set hours um what risk is there to damage to not just the estrogen but people but the um the you know the rain gardens those kind of things we often see you know the qualified trees have been knocked by a truck those kind of things where there's no come back council has to rate pays have to pay for that um and with the significant narrowing what are not talking about the 2.5 minute strip adjacent to the building itself you're talking about the um the four metre area yeah to the west of where they want the outdoor diet yeah yeah so look um we really don't want vehicles it is a public road but we don't want vehicles going through there because it is heavily pedestrianised and and sometimes there's quite a bit of pedestrian other furniture there from riverside um there is loading spaces outside on litchfield street so we encourage um the loading of goods and for that to occur on litchfield street as opposed to because it's very close to riverside and they can get access around the back as opposed to trucks driving up and down that strip it's not something we try and encourage but at the moment council's having that conversation around oxford terrace and what hours it is currently open and that'll be a decision of council is to um the whole of oxford terrace will be open for delivery vehicles um because at the moment it's quite but this the new structure and stuff in um that that four meter strip will still be kept as a as a four meter strip so you know vehicles could still negotiate it but but it is certainly getting very busy when you look at all the other stuff which is um potentially spilling out onto it so look it's not something we encourage but currently um you know they can't legally use that so I'm just concerned that if you get to the point of actually enclosure there's nowhere for pedestrians to go there's the rain gardens on one side there's an enclosure on the other side and a truck going past there's no way for them to actually move either side yeah so you you've still got the two and half meter strip adjacent to the building and then you've got the ag rock adjacent to that if it's enclosed you can't get to that two and a half meter strip but there's still walkway they'll still the whole area wouldn't be enclosed there'd be walkway right well um we'll move on to the debate and I'll open that up I was actually looking forward to this item on the agenda more than any other item on the agenda today it has a very practical application which it says this doesn't qualify for policy under our existing policy so can you please delegate it to the head of transport to decide whether to approve the licence go for it richard you've got my full blessing I just think that it's a fantastic thing riverside has transformed the central city it has made it an exciting destination amazing place to go and uh and I i went past there um over the easter weekend and it was just jam-packed with people there were thousands of people poured into the area just enjoying themselves on a beautiful beautiful hot sunny weekend so um I i just am incredibly grateful to what richard uh peebles and mike pokowski and the rest of the team have done down there I trust the organisation to do the right thing in relation to this licensing arrangement that can be made by delegation and that's going to make it a much more direct relationship between the organisation and the riverside market and that's going to make a real difference so thank you very much for the paper uh tim and then sarah yeah just for a moment there I kind of thought you know like listening to the questions why would you do business in christchurch but um I'd have to say this is fantastic I totally agree with the mayor and I think it's best left with staff and now good luck I think it's going to be fantastic yeah and the thing is like I completely agree my um my concerns over the the impact are to do with the volume of cars down there so outside in the space on oxford terrace there used to be a lot of on-street car parking and riverside is one of the best examples in the entire city as to why it's actually best to remove the on-street parking because you get a much greater pedestrian amenity you know this was built no on-street car parking there's off-street car parking available nearby and it really does show the contrast about what is possible when you focus on people in people space and it really highlights the lost opportunity that we have just seen in high street so andrew yeah thank you um yeah if there's if there's one thing that's been a game changer in the development of the central city is riverside and we see the um large number of people sitting out outside there on the grass and chairs and tables and consuming food that they've bought from riverside and generally enjoying themselves and creating an excellent atmosphere right in the heart of the central city if there's one thing that we know about christchurch it's that it's a city with four seasons and that we know outdoor dining operates very differently in the winter than it does in the summer time which involves the need for creating some pseudo indoor space areas where there can be heating shelter and so on I'm sure that under the delegation that we're account um any conflict between or any opportunity for pedestrians cyclists and motor vehicle movements and I absolutely agree that what we are doing here is creating a space for people but certainly listening to the answers to questions there should be space for all of those activities to take place safely at the same time as making this an attractive year-round destination for outdoor dining and outdoor use so I'm excited about this but I also understand the concerns very confident richard that you will um take account of all of the things that have been raised as you exercise the delegation that hopefully we're about to give you um mike and then who was the other one just thank you and look on face value when you look at what's in front of us the conceptual drawings it actually looks like a really good outcome I am concerned of actually what potentially it could become once you start enclosing this space I mean we're saying I guess seeing a creep of um you know private business taking over the public realm which does concern starting to squeeze more people into a smaller corridor more actually effect that that will have so I like what's in front of me but I am very concerned about actually where this could be heading for for the scene um um I i the riverside guys have created a fantastic asset for christchurch and if we can help for the whole city and if we can help them by delegating richard this to do this I just think um go go hard it's good so more and faster I agree this and the way they've thought out this design including the movable planters and and the lighting and the the louvres that'll open and close I just think that they do things really well um I think I'm happy to delegate it to richard because he seems like a pretty reasonable sort of bloke here so I think he would do it all right and um just to call out there to ben and jerry's if you haven't tried the vegan ice cream you're missing out on something it is amazing I'll be supporting it and I would encourage you to try the um cherry garcia rather than the vegan it's the better ice cream but that aside um picking up on mike's point um if this is what business creeping into the public space looks like let's hope that happens a lot more around the city because there's a lot of dead public space right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much on to the mayor's monthly report um it
Item and come back to it in a minute but if you could just get me some advice on that we'll just move into the central city projects high street casual chum and high street tram extension this is a technical document yes moved by jake seconded by james any discussion I'll put um aaron just just a question um with uh is there any spare um traffic light poles because we like to up cycle in our wood that we could move to herewood road coming out just in the interest of um saving materials noted brilliant thank you um yani you're not going to move on to the items on the px paper are you I put some questions through um I really just wanted to understand around the um the just the whole traffic modeling for the new state multi-use arena that's the next item sorry that is not an item that we're dealing with on this matter these are the decisions that we have already made as a council these are the technical amendments um or resolutions that have to be you go to page 162 okay I'm just not going to put up with this anymore I've said to you that is an item to be dealt with in the next this is our comment section of the agenda my question relates to 5.5 which is in the public section of this agenda on page 162 I don't see what's what's not fair about it being raised item 5.2 so there were 5.5 item 5.5 on the honest agenda it's to do with the detail under section 5. there's a number of changes that have been um advised to us and there's a number of comments around things being either further investigated as part of future work yep so there are no changes as a result of 5.4 or 5.5 we are just advising the council that the hearings panel um resolution for us to undertake this will be undertaken we haven't forgotten about it and it is being done it's part of future work that is planned as part of the ltp yeah sorry what I was trying to gone in to the impact of the new multi-use arena because if you go down manchester straight like clearly what we thought was going to happen I mean I've talked to bus drivers who've got delays the traffic's not working as I thought it would and as we thought would be we've already so we don't understand that it was designed and this was designed and put through as part of a design we knew the multi-use arena was in the future and we have done that the the already the actions and that and um I've lost a word sorry that how that intersection will um run run work in the future be considered as part of the feature project which is in the draft ltp yeah yeah so it's been asked and answered I'm not having any badgering thank you um is there any other point I'm gonna might I will we're in debate now I will support this uh because it's just the technical resolutions on the decision that council made last term um so I council we missed a huge opportunity to get some really excellent outcomes to high street um and I think the compromise we did was actually too much yeah can I speak to it as well cool yeah um but I think if you take a high-level view there's been a lot of changes that have been done we've put some transitional stuff along ferry road we've got a lot greater assessment now of the impact of some of the potential developments as well as some new developments and I think you know fundamentally we can't just keep putting in projects that were done as part of the accessible city or the inaccessible city um we can't just keep doing them like we actually need to take a stock take of how the traffic is functioning in the central city from my observation and from people I've talked to there's a lot of dysfunction with things that were supposed to work in a certain way that aren't there's probably some really good stuff that is working well but clearly I think with multi-use arena where we've just got additional funding on our ltp that we're consulting on we should actually think about really good connections for cycling and pedestrians as a big picture rather than just doing each little block on a block by block basis so my concern is that there seems to be a lack of an integrated traffic pedestrian cycling planning for this whole quadrant of the city some of the improvements that we were told that would be beneficial like manchester straight I mean I've talked to bus drivers who said they spent 15 minutes sitting in gridlock because a few cars get in into the middle of manchester street clearly that's not a functional uh priority for pt and nor do I think it's functional for people that are accessing the city so I'm not going to support this today I think we're missing an opportunity to look at the big picture I think things have moved on since the accessible city plans were put in place and we actually need to step back and think about that community of's happened in this area since and come up with a bit much better coordination thank you I don't think it's actually too much to worry about because because of three anonymous complaints over two years with regards to the gravel car parks and it seems to be a want around this table to get rid of them there'll be less traffic anyway I will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no yeah I'm opposed thank you um that's carried we'll move on to the next
That's carried the next item is the draft submission on environment canterbury's long-term plan and just have added some additional text to address the points uh that we have uh been discussing um both here at the meeting in relation to uh clean air and in terms of strengthening the wording um also strengthening the wording around nitrates and groundwater um and and also at my request um a additional wording about the free shuttle because the free shuttle is something that uh our own residents have raised um time and time again we've tried to get it included within the regional public transport plan it is there but there is the sense that it's the chicken and egg they say that it needs to come after the buildings are built and we're saying no actually it needs to be there now because um that idea of making it easy to get around in the central city um and and filling back that sort of bit of a gap in the um would would would certainly help as well so um so we've got just hand over to staff and you talk about the the changes because everyone has seen the and thank you for such a speedy turnaround yes that's no trouble um if I'd known you're going to put it on the screen I would have tidied it up a little bit more in the five minutes that we that we were frantically working it just shows how quickly you've worked but to deal with the nitrate issue first at the top of the screen you can see the existing paragraph 18 and then the suggestion is that we strengthen that by adding in the middle of the paragraph that we are concerned to see rather than simply noting the emerging trend of rising concentrations and then at the end we welcome clarification of the regional council strategy for addressing this emerging trend and then finally we suggest that increased monitoring would be clearly required once nitrate levels approach 50 of that maximum acceptable value and that wording at the very end makes the point that the mav is set in terms of short-term exposure and it's you're exposed over the long term um so there's sort of options in there for how so strong you want this paragraph to be in terms of raising these issues with ecam all right sarah you're not sarah you're pauline thank you I think we need to be really strong my concern is that we do we do have a new zealand study going on at the moment on the maximum allowable level being different from that set by who and lot of research so I'm wondering if we could put something in about ecan being flexible about emerging evidence as it emerges around the um the lowering of the maximum allowable value because we keep referring to who there and that is extremely high and we know that particularly when you see evidence on the macro invertebrates which is down around 1.3 I just don't I think we're still sitting looking at 50 percent of the mav is still too high as far as we're concerned so if we could find some wording about ecam being flexible around changing standards or waters so I'm just one we're just thinking about whether that's actually in the drinking water um standard so we just need to check that with helen um but we can certainly put something in there about flexibility I think it might be responding to future changes yes exactly and that is what we've discussed it's about making sure that we're informed by that immediate research and responsive and flexible to that so we can because I mean 50 of the value now at 11.3 is what 6.75 or something which is ridiculously high still but I mean we're in the right space so I mean we can get the sign off of the final detail of the wording we don't need to wordsmith it here I would like to change the words is set for short-term exposure to um has been established based on acute exposure so you know there's some technical tidy up that I've disclosed yeah and we've sort of just been um circulating it around diane and sarah and to make sure that we've the word and tidy up so I don't I think that generally people are comfortable with the proposed changes in a general sense and I think the wording is sufficient for us to tidy up the wording before it go back to the resolution do you want to deal with the other two bits sorry do you want to deal with the other elements yeah you will deal with yeah paragraph five um oh yes no a paragraph will run through the rears sorry carry on yes okay so just a um stop the the paragraph about the free um yeah did you want me to comment on that um so this is another bit I would have tied it up if I'd known it was going on the screen um I our initial suggestion I guess is just to add um those red words to the end of existing paragraph five to say in addition we support further work on the affordability of public transport as part of the review of bus fares including consideration of free services but we're after the shuttle in the central could just put and the reinstatement of the um of the free uh central city shuttle that will do so yeah okay sorry I don't understand no no and um the clean air so we understand that was raised in the public forum and wanted to point out the uh strengthened wording that we added to paragraph 32 following the staff briefing on the 26th of march when we met with um councillors to discuss the draft submission uh the feedback we had then that was that that paragraph just wasn't strong enough and so we've added the red wording in there to the draft that you have attached to the report right so that people are generally comfortable with the change in direction I mean given what we heard this morning and I i mean I was kind of on the impression ecam we're doing more in that quarry space but I think what we heard this morning is there's still huge gaps so I was a bit concerned um with we support the steps they've taken to improve monitoring around air quality they're currently doing is um and thought we may want to be stronger particularly around that but I mean I think fundamentally um we we do want to support a level of service so that people can see what the expected response time would be if they do log those complaints and it's not just quarries it is it is dust as well I mean I know um there's been some concern but I just also wanted to check on the on the free shuttle because previously we've been advised that we cannot be anti-competitive with existing contract providers so we can't run a service that's free where companies have contracts to deliver bus services run where there's no service yeah so where there's no service but obviously the bus routes have changed quite significantly the shuttle doesn't run on an existing bus route sorry manchester street is the key bus corridor now it doesn't have to go on maintenance it didn't used to do it just saying reinstate the shuttle it's not a it's not a've read the act it doesn't it complies okay that's good because when we tried to get an east west one we were repeatedly told that we couldn't do it because of that but I mean because there are scheduled services running east to west side north south as well but the other thing just in that regard is when we were doing the car parking um policy strategy the idea of for example three buses within the four abs like a zone zero so I just I mean I don't want to rule out that option as well because I think both deserve to be looked at but can we make it a little bit wider just to include the ability for people just to get on the bus within the you know go travel within the four hours yeah well I mean that you know like it might be a better way of doing it but we don't obviously need to get advice on that but so we're generally comfortable with the direction of it we can wordsmith the final sign off final wording agreed between the um the mayor and chief executive yeah I mean we'll just get advice on it but we'll just sign off the final wording and um the second question is does the council want this to be um uh hurden um does it do they want the council to present the submission to ecan or are they quite happy that we just um forward the submission to them just forward it to them yep well that that's the thing is that are we going to agree that it be heard in support of its submissions so I think we should be heard yes okay so um so so so andrew are you happy to move the approval and agree that it be heard and support and delegate oh you can't move it because it says the mayor and deputy determined representation pauline mover seconded by by melanie okay aaron yeah just the only question I had when I went through the whole thing was why did we not mention the incredible rates rise that's like saying that our council's budget _''_704.64 at the meeting where this was discussed but I think that it was made relatively clear that there was to be a um focus on the issues that is an issue because it's been that's about the only thing that's been raised with me by members of the public is yes it's not a correct information it's not a question I mean the issues are in relation to the to the um to to what they are doing so it's the it's the programs of work so as I understood you know councillors were quite comfortable with going down that track if you want to um yeah I've got I've got some wording leanne I could send through I'm sorry but some counsellors here who are not happy with us we're not at the workshop and so if they were not at the workshop that's your problem I don't care yes we we hadn't we had a workshop with um to discuss the questions with them I i wasn't at it so and I can with the econ governors where everybody was comfortable that we wouldn't comment on the rates rise um and certainly that was the basis of the discussion with the econ governors and even though there was some discussion in that forum um the result was that the people in the the people in the room were comfortable that we wouldn't um make comment on the rates rise um and there was interesting information that was given by the econ governors at that meeting around the rates rise and the effect on christchurch residents versus the figure which has seen so much attention in the media I've just sent through to joe some wording potentially we could look to include okay well that can be put up as an amendment so um sorry yep um thanks so much I'm just thinking about the the types of things that we have put in our submission about the outcomes that we're seeking and the issues that we've raised is the work that we have asked to be done and the focus that we have asked for from ecan to be consistent with a lower rates increase um when we've been asking for additional work can we see what I've done it's a question for staff actually thanks sam yeah but it would answer your question really easily yeah I've asked staff you usually ask for the stuff answer for the stuff so sarah the question is that the feedback we've provided would that result in a lower rate is it consistently because they're obviously going to do as we are going to do a juggling exercise after we've listened to submissions um so I mean the reason that I don't support us making a submission on the rates rise but I do around the technical detail and I would have been quite happy for this merely to have been submitted but that but that's by the by that the real reason that I don't agree with us doing that is that that is an issue that will be discussed with ecan as a matter of course after hearing submissions from the residents who are going to be asked rates and so why should we collectively a group of individual rate payers which is what we would be here make a submission on that subject here I mean the the reality is is that we can't represent the view of the of the city or even an understanding of the view of the city given that that there's going to be a juggling act made at the end about what the race implications so if it's easy to put it as amendment and then if it gets lost we're concerned by the proposed rate increases across the region noting that this will vary by ratable unit we would request that as elected members who direct environment canterbury staff to reduce this additional rating burden by finding further operational savings we believe a significant reduction this week would demonstrate a physical really our role to talk about the rest of the region um yeah it is it is an amendment but it's very rude well no but it's it is actually more responsible it's not it's not an appropriate amendment it's when they are out hearing directly from their residents right across the region as we are for ours there will be a juggling act that will happen at the end of it where essentially the the weight of submissions will be considered people will look through all of the issues um I mean if the if the um if the if this simply said that we note that all of us are operating at times of um that require fiscal restraint uh due to the challenges that we all face then I'm good with that but I think asking um the uh environment canterbury uh members to do this in the context of the broader responsibility I just don't think that it's it's not our role to speak on path of the rest of canterbury just for our residents we we can't_''_1047.28 be concerned about stuff across the region we're only concerned about ourselves anyway um I don't know I look I'm gonna I'm going to um adjourn this item and I'm going to take advice as to the um nature of this amendment because I believe that we are not under the local government able to actually put that amendment um to the council um today so um if if I could just I think I'll just move on to the next item on the agent I'll just let this lie on the table until we get I'm just going to join this item and come back to it and I'm
You know but welcome oh thank you and thank you for your patience no that's awesome and we're looking forward to hearing from you thank you sounds good no I know everyone might be paying for some morning today so I'll whip through this um and I have the lovely marianne here beside me as well just to help as well but yes so um I guess an activity that happened in our award was the election um for a new chair and so very exciting to be taking on the role but also very grateful and excited to have david cartwright as our deputy chair as well so it's great that we can continue working as an effective team and while he's not here he is here in spirit and so I'll say a massive thank you to david um for everything that he's done as chair uh moving on to the next item is the draft ltp community engagement so the board has been out and about holding information stalls and providing people with the opportunity to get the consultation document local elected members members about the draft ltp so we find that going out to where people are obviously is a way better result than holding drop-in sessions which where people are expected to come so it's about us getting out in the community and we've been going out to bishop dale new world fiddleton library northwoods new world and avon head mall and people have been stopping and talking to us which is great with a range of issues which we've listed there so things like library closing hours cycle ways traffic issues bus services and the representation review there were a ranging views on various topics and we are encouraging people to make sure they do a submission we also had our school principals meeting so the board had a great meeting on the 12th of march with all of the local school principals in the area not everyone could come obviously principals are incredibly busy but it was great to have them there those that did come along and safety issues regarding traffic around the schools was a big hot topic so the board the schools to see what can be done some issues were also raised around the protection around the protection of trees which are on some of the grounds of the schools and there was a bit of frustration from the schools around the bureaucracy and red tape in regards to having work done to the trees so we will follow this up with council staff allen vale school is a provider of education to children and young people with special needs and they talk to us about the transition to work program that they have for their older students which is a great program but with the impacts of covert 19 on local businesses and employers they've seen a reduction of opportunities that are normally available to their young people and of course there's also the exciting building project underway in our area as well bringing together the burnside primary cobin intermediate and allenvale school into one of the new campus on ireland road and the schools were deemed rebuilds following the earthquake so this project has been a long time coming so it's really exciting we the stakes living laboratory trust this is an awesome group of people doing outstanding work on learning and research in the styx river catchment so although their bases in the hereward ward the work they undertake spans across the papanoi innis and coastal burwood areas as well but on this recent site visit board members were able to hear a lot about the work they're doing in regards to water quality monitoring restoring and protecting natural habitats and ecosystems predator control and the reintroduction of native species they run regular volunteering events including a monthly bird monitoring program to record the number of individual water bird species and they also run school education programs and summer student research scholarships for tertiary students so we're so grateful for the amazing work that they do in the area and lastly we also had the pleasure to sit down and have a chat with sarah palette who is the new mp for island so nearly 90 percent of the island electorate is within the finland board area and we talked about some of the key issues in the area and there address some of these um issues particularly those that require central government action and I think it's just a really great example of us wanting to collaborate and catch up regularly so I'm sure we'll be seeing more of sarah in the future so yeah if you have any questions happy to take them thank you no I presume sam you'd like to move this and james would like to second it are there any questions any discussion are you going to get away with it I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you thank you very much thank you so much great work right we'll adjourn now for morning tea and if we could be
Before morning tea we will right um and and sorry about that joe so joe zervos is here um representing kelly who's not able to be here today because he's doing something equally athletic to his last uh reason for not being is that working yeah white eye coastal burwood community so apologies from kelly he's um hiking the kepler track today so um for the last few days so you're stuck with myself and chris who's here to support me rightio so I think you've all got the report in front of you so I've take it you've read most of it um where do we start off the approval of removal of a redundant metro bus stop and bow hill road this was a bus stop that hasn't been used for a very long time and it was actually didn't even have a sign on it so we just removed the yellow lines so that's really straightforward events in the red zone we had poly fest and ltp consultation at polyfest and it was absolutely amazing to amount of stalls and food and all color everywhere is a really good event um the red zone six bike race is coming up this weekend is it no 26th of april and that's a six-hour mountain bike race through the danielle dunnell park area of the red zone um anyone's keen you should enter um at the east by east corner where this has been held there's actually been quite a lot of events happening lately and just over the easter weekend there was the um 50 miniature radio-controlled semi-trucks at the little rc haulers event um very popular with the big boys toys people they love it um a couple of the things relating to the red zone that I'd like to actually thank staff for um the bow park fence which runs between the red zone and the actual park has been removed and opening up the space and it looks wonderful so um thankful for that in south shore um they we got holder staff and got no camping signs installed in all the cul-de-sacs which go on to the estuary side me the other day and she reported that they're working a real real treat and that they've had camper vans actually pull up into the cul-de-sacs and just continue driving on so she's really grateful for that and stitcher matt is one of our community groups and they do a wonderful job they're a resource of upscaling sewing skills and recycling fabric and creativity and they do all sorts of things from making the mask which they made 100 for children's day which is unfortunately cancelled because of covered and they will use those masks for future events with stitcher they make wonderful quilts and things for people in need all sorts of blankets clothes everything little toys there um they are actually relocating from where they are now and they're moving into a shop in the surf side mall so that's really positive for them parkland's community meeting that's going to be held tonight it was scheduled to be held thursday the 4th of march but because of covert it was postponed local school representatives the police council staff will solutions that we can actually look at helping the community there's been a lot of crime and just um especially around their little parklands reserve um so tonight we will actually be going to that the council we have actually funded for a facilitator for chris minnie to actually go along so we're really thankful for that chris does a wonderful job and we'll be looking to work proactively with them moving forward co-snap um if you've been down to the pier you probably would have seen the little frames that was or you've installed down at the pier um so it's a global initiative whereas you put your cell phone into the frame and you take a photo of the exact same location each time to see the differences in the ghost it's really helpful because at the moment the coast has been accreting severely and if you look at the pipelines along the beach at the moment um which is stormwater pipelines they're about 75 centimetres under sand so they're actually blocking up with sand so hopefully we'll most of the sand away and clear it out um the site visit to south brighton surf lifesaving club this is awesome kelly and I went down and we got shown through by rowan mcnaughton and brand new facility nice big community space they've got such a good look out over the beach and a big community space where they hopefully will have some events held there hire it out to people that want to use it for like an exercise room they've even got an elevator inside there which is pretty flash for a safe club with these you can see they've got a little bit of car packing around the side and a new tarsiel and they're really thankful that the road adjacent along roaring parade has actually all been sealed again it's looking lovely but they're still working on trying to get the bit between the road and the new ceiling done because it's a wee bit rugged from the construction so it's looking fantastic and it's very exciting to see another surf club upgraded especially summersley lifesaver and you can see our very lovely emcee james daniels there helping out for the day I actually went in and did the walk and everyone else ran but it was a wonderful event and the peer-to-peer race actually used to be held in new brighton for years and years and then just after the earthquakes they cancelled it and it hasn't been held since so this is reintroducing it and trying to get it up and going again it wasn't very well supported probably due to the fact that the city to surf was before but the event was a wonderful thing for the area because every entrant got a 10 voucher to actually use at new brighton on the day and five dollars of that was actually put in by the club and five dollars from the actual shop it was used there so a good initiative and something to try and keep moving in the area um other things that have been happening in the area just last weekend the new brighton rugby club which is part of eastern sports and wreck had their 100 there was cars parked for miles and really good to see um the board also visited tearlanga which is kingsley um and we had we were shown through and we're trying to reconnect with the community and seeing how we can help out with that community so it was really lovely to actually go there and be welcomed and be shown around and see what we can do for them yep and that's it well I'm sure phil will want to move that and I'll second it in the absence of mr daniels who who did excuse himself and he he did yeah he has a personal reason for not being here so thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carrie thank you very much and um finally waimea
Uh the next item on the agenda is um uh tapatika o rakaihotu banksmanchala community board glory peeden okay thank you okay um a few updates I do um take it that our board report has been read and there is a few things in there that has been going on lately just a few things we'll point out to everyone last month we had our um board meeting at the ghertie in ecuador public engagement was strong on the 15th of march with several public forums booked and a couple of hot topics the board was keen to accommodate the expected large numbers um and the meeting was moved to the gate at that time also we were in discussions about covert and we wanted to make sure that even if we did change alert levels that we could still cater for the engagement that was requested from the community public forum topics included the accra public picnic tables roading issues steadfast development ltp in the eckera service center citizens hub desk and the acaral wastewater that day we had 30 to 40 public come to that that move to a bigger location and it was well attended and every single one of them um in favour in supporting the um continuing services of you know the continuing service center in nakara and the funding of that one of the things that was also brought up at that meeting was the we had representation from the akron bay's lions club asked us to consider allowing them to fund the construction and direction of shelters over some of the existing tables nicaragua including the barbecue which the lions installed some years back uh the purpose for this was to commemorate um 50th anniversary the bay's lions club in february next year um enhance the across furniture skate provide much needed shelter from the sun for visitors and residents the photo shown there is of a similar project which is in kaikoura so it's like so quite exciting having community funding coming to help add to the environment and our council assets come to paris group in nicaragua um regarding the symmetries um requested development of the western area of the ackerar catholic cemetery an installation of currently preparing background documentation including conservation plan to support the development plan for all three ecuador symmetries next steps are to seek input from anuku runanga that was a fantastic report and we want to thank staff for coming out to akaroa and head of parks to come out and actually work through the issues and so it is great to actually have the community board working with staff to come up with um moving forward issues that are going on so big thanks to staff coming out that day and it's like it's worth acknowledging stuff because I mean we know that there are some tricky issues um on the peninsula you know in the one-size-fits-all thing you know the geography doesn't always suit and uh the regulations don't always conform to to how we need them so we really appreciate the engagement there that we are getting from staff on that yeah it is appreciated and lastly just regarding community funding um recently we did have a um combined meeting with the croatia city council staff and rata foundation regarding upcoming upcoming community funding rural attendance but it is important how how the money and community funding gets used with our community groups small amounts of funding from council land rata to go a long way so and it's acknowledged by the community as well so that's just one thing we wanted to acknowledge that is going on in the moment we do know that strength and community fund is is well used and yeah well sought after yeah so that's us I i did want to acknowledge your missing out on a penguin um and I would say that we'd lend you the one that we bought for um yeah it is staying nearby I mean it's good to hear that it's it's an in thai taboo but um you know it was there's quite a few penguins that I know that there were um I mean they went for amazing prices yeah it's going to be interesting to see where the echarol one has ended up because apparently that was um I'm still not sure where that actually has gone but um the community to find so that having a weak community you know go out and find a penguin so where the penguin has ended up it's been quite exciting but um the last thing is um easter weekend was like say thank you for everyone for travelling local and um heading out to akaroa it was a very busy warm weekend over easter and roads were very busy but um everyone was very good but now thank you excellent andrew you'd like to move this do I have a seconder james goff put that motion yep I must but I'll keep it brief um just relating to the um akaroa cemeteries matter I'd like to thank staff for work that was done relatively quickly in preparation for the 180 year anniversary of the arrival of the compta parade with the akaroa early french and german settlers on board at that weekend celebration there were a number of descendants of those early settlers many of whom still live in accord many of whom have spread far and wide since then but I'd like to particularly thank restoring three not the two that were expected gravestones so two plus one um and for work done removing two um damaging wilding trees that had become um planted in some of the the grave sites um the background and we've heard it in previous um ltp and annual plan submissions in the past is that the um cemeteries group the early settlers group had been very concerned that the lack of maintenance at the cemeteries they were delighted with the work that staff have done and are very pleased with the way the cemeteries have been maintained so that actually represents huge progress both with the work being done and in the relationships in accurate was great to see that resolution passed by the community board that now gives clear direction about the um memorial gate and the possibility of additional burial space so it was great that the community board were able to represent the community view in passing that resolution thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much
Much thank you thank you thank you uh spreading cashmere uh sprayed and cashmere community board carolyn potter don't think lee's here can I just say in support um I just want to say that we had a big three big nights last week and um I just want to thank publicly thank staff led by joe um in our local office I just thought of that when I was stepping down and thinking of the hard work they put in for all three separate occasions thank you um we've got no pates and but we had we've had so many small small and big occasions in our ward this last month almost to compete with linwood um central uh this was the celebration this was amazing I found out this a pro this campaign to stop the right-hand turn out of barrington started more than 20 years ago the staff kept saying to me these three people were involved 20 years ago and that formed the foundation of the older person's forum and our ward and I keep saying no that's not true and I know that these people it was true these people started it 20 years ago a campaign to stop the right hand turn out of barrington mall the staff knew it I persisted in saying they were wrong and I was wrong and they um they started the older persons forum which continues to this day in which meeting was held yesterday in our offices and um it was and then the spray neighborhood network was formed and it started campaigning on it as well so it's been a very long time that they have wanted to make this safe and this council staff have responded before um but for reasons of finance or whatever it never went ahead and on this occasion it did and we had a celebration in the mall because it wasn't appropriate to have red ribbon across the exit from barrington mall with traffic and there we are with dennis and sonja leaders of the sprayed neighborhood network cutting the red ribbon that we draped over everyone's shoulders in the mall and we had a cup of coffee and we had some an ex-member of this braden neighborhood network sent flowers up from invercargill thank you this is our um this is the edible and sustainable garden awards I'm so sorry that um you've made the decision not to have them anymore um saint albans but I'm sorry just this year yes because um it was it's such a fine occasion I know you did we copied it but we introduced the edible sustainable sustainables and that's that's ray king from the horticultural society it the range of people who um got awards on this is just wonderful young old many ethnicities diverse wonderful and it was a great occasion and this oh this is consulting on the ltp um I think everybody who's consulted on the ltp will understand that not many people are interested in telling us about what they should we should put in or out of the ltp but are always interested in telling us about their roads and rubbish um but um this is we we did it in south library and we did it in barrington mall and can oh we've consulted in other areas as well and it's been it's been an enjoyable process um this is the blessing at west braeden school we had a marvelous photo of the red sky in the morning as we walked into the school grounds and for the blessings I do like the ceremony of blessings walking around the new building and touching the walls to make them safe is I don't know it's sort of almost romantic this building one building at spraydon school has five kitchens so the education system is shifting its way of teaching people how to live their lives not just the academic subjects but how to actually live their lives it's a very interesting thing for those of us who are older to consider and to understand so and the blessing was a great experience this is the cashmere valley reserve which is the probably the most popular playground in our wards its location is between the river and the hills and it seems to attract people from everywhere it's got it's one of the few actually recognised by cars um but the the council did a great job of um doing a range of plantings outside of that board area and but this was this is the map which led to quite a lot of drama between involving our area and um horsewolf hornby's area as well with the residents from craycroft and westmoreland and that is the size of the road between the two suburbs that is now open and the residents had been promised a that there would never be a road between the two suburbs back up the hill and be that when there was going to be a road it wouldn't be open before the lights went in so there was some difficulties some tension but nonetheless we had an excellent meeting arranged by the staff local staff and civic staff richard and his team and by the pardon and john higgins oh I'm glad you mentioned him because he has a hard job and he was extremely gracious and the meeting went well and I think there was a greater understanding on both sides of the table meeting at sprayton school we have we alternate our board meetings from 8 a.m to 5 p.m and this was a 5 p.m meeting at spraydon's school and the principal in the middle there took us out around the school grounds to show us the changes that have had to be made in the buildings that have been made they had about three kitchens didn't they in the block that their children are in and they're next door to hillmorton high and they talk to us about establishing a very close relationship with that high school it was really good to get to know our local community better and we had several people presenting to that community board including the local the local garden community garden and the young people from kashmir high wanting more basketball courts which everyone wants um and there were other things that we did including discussing the edington crossing the hill morton high I got taken around the hillmilton high new block several kitchens by the principal we had a residence meeting at hoon hay which was brilliantly run one hour out and I took the ltp consultation to an egg discovery easter egg thing at the same place we had um a lansdowne play school had a celebration the george the fifth reserve had a celebration which tim and I were at um the cashmere view park the um the cashmere view park and I saw the biggest rubbish dump in our ward going out in the community cars that I've ever seen and staff are now looking into um the causes of this rubbish dump and why it's there and how we can remove it right as we speak it's between the court theatre and the new um restored mill building in eddington that's it very good thank you so uh tim would like to move it and you've got a question um and melanie would like to second it yes I guess um following on from um carolyn's um mentioning the gosford way um meeting and with staff I do want to thank staff they're quite right they were very gracious but they they admitted they could have done things better to go forward to admit that it could be things done better and to um to explain how we got to those things it wasn't perfect but to learn as we go forward we're always learning I think it's really important one of the interesting things and it was mentioned with the others community board the nzta took sound recordings from a certain time of day and it's absolutely a waste of time because we also had traffic counts taken in december from the certain and intersection which is a waste of time because of school holidays and they were taken out of context so you know we've got to really get a lot better at that and it's got to be light for like in front of a better term I think with the walls lee road hoon hay road we've got a lot of opportunity there while it's being done up and I'd hate to lose that opportunity with staff as we kind of say oh well we've moved on now so I do still want the community don't think they can be lost it's too important and we've now gained a bit of faith back with those two residence associations who we have worked with for a long time we had a great working relationship it got kicked in the teeth without question over this um and and you you'll be part of this as well so we've got we've got to keep that momentum to keep that faith which we have now re reun if we lose it again the work that we do as elected members both community board and councillors will be um I think lost and damaged permanently well he was franketh and I would be good on him thank you thank you tim is this part of the debate oh sorry I thought that was debate um yeah just in terms of the ltp engagement no well okay do you just in terms of your engagement um do you have like a ward fact sheet or do you think it'd be helpful just when you're engaging with people to have more oh yeah we policy but we had some hard copies to end up because people want to see them and staff had presented the information really well we also had a training session on how to do that um bubble thing yeah we had a training session with local residents on how to do that as well so that's using the online tool yeah yeah all right okay um cool thank you and happy to have a comment when it's appropriate are we in comments now or debate it was the debate before I allowed you to ask a question oh I just wanted to make the point that it was really good to see the progress around barrington thank you to everyone that's been involved I know that's been a long standing I i think what's interesting for council at a governance level is the fact that we've got langdon's road a similar development happening still after 30 years of something not in this community no no but the issue around planning for shopping malls please don't disrupt the meeting that's enough why wanted to further acknowledge staff thank you carolyn for acknowledging staff I mean I've been involved as well in many community meetings over the last wee while and staff go over and above and we really appreciate what they do last night I had three three staff were cleaning up after the garden awards on their own stacking chairs um putting food away doing dishes um it helped us even at night so um we really do appreciate what what you all do so thanks thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you the next item on the agenda is tapatica
Patients in time waipapa papanoi inna's community board um thanks for having us along to present today um I'm gonna take the report as read and we don't have any part a so we're just gonna highlight a few things that have been going on in our area um just first up I do want to say we this year decided not to run our community board events like the edible gardens and the community pride garden awards and those sorts of things and we put that money back into our funding to go out to community groups this year and so that's why we don't have any pretty pictures of those things sorry it's just acknowledging children's study which is really a city-wide event but with some high involvement from the waipapa papanuia staff and in particular our recreation advisor it was really sad to see that it couldn't go ahead in person this year because of the issues around covert levels at that time but was really what was really good to see was there was really good engagement really positive engagement by the community with that format and looking forward to it coming back in person next year um we had our first principles meeting for the year this is something we do want to turn with principals from our area and we have a breakfast meeting and we usually invite a guest speaker along and then we just have a general chat about what's happening in the schools and this month we had staff from the council's learning through action program come to speak about what's on offer for schools through their programs part of the reason for doing this is because our board has recognized the importance of civic education for young people and so this year we've actually set aside some funding to pay for transport to get school children to those um council courses um programs on that so we wanted to let the principals know what was on offer there and we've had some uptake on that already so that's great to see community events sort of summer season is coming to a close now we've final one held at the end of february in sheldon park run by belfast community network uh also on the same day the community focused trust uh ran a community day in saint albans uh both of those were really well supported and had great feedback from those who attended I'm also had the shirley shine event which was run by um shirley community trust and that was attended by over a thousand people at mcfarland park and then that bottom picture there is one of our summer with your neighbours um events it was the willow view community gardens in redwood springs at the reserve in there marin councillors will be well aware that this weekend we're opening the saint albans community centre uh construction is complete it's been handed over to the sunurbans residents association who are the operators of the facility we've been gifted the name corhinger which really has a triple meaning in this context it really means to gather or to collect and it reflects the geography of the area with waterways that come together as tributaries it also reflects the a mahangakai area and also the now current use as a community centre of the community gathering together under that roof the official opening is the saturday morning you will all have been invited and we look forward to seeing the mayor and some of some of our councillors there as well um another thing that would have been happening behind the scenes is this correction of a historical misspelling of what has been called the caputoni stream and this came up as we were looking at consultation on name changes at two reserves on the stix river the original maori name of the waterway was kaputahi but the story goes that it was misread and then has been spelled incorrectly ever since um so we're wanting to restore its original name and so that process is underway yes long time ago uh in just an update for councillors on in the mirror on downstream effects of the northern corridor motorway there's ongoing work at the moment and really experimental traffic calming underway in consultation with the local neighborhood in the francis street area that is leading to is being cul-de-sac for a couple of weeks in one format and then there's a mid-block cul-de-sac being trialled again under temporary traffic management so that we can get feedback from the community on the impacts that's having and we can see what it does to traffic patterns one thing it is doing to traffic patterns is it's diverting some traffic including local traffic to adjacent streets and we're getting a lot of questions at the moment from residents about about that and it's keeping our staff and our council staff here very busy uh responding to those also last week there was a public meeting in redwood for residents in that area who are being impacted by noise from uh from the motorway that meeting was organized and facilitated by duncan webb we had nzta and project staff in attendance as well there's been some actions come out of that there's a number of questions about aspects of the design being asked by residents uh one of the really obvious things at the moment is we're in the period where the but the final low noise asphalt seal on the road is not there so we've kind of got the worst of both worlds and how it's operating right now that seal is programmed to go on in the next sealing season which starts in spring but we could be up to a year away for the from that being completed so there's some questions being asked at the moment that's sitting between dr webb and nzta all the papanui community board staff members and our two councillors were both at that meeting as well to support residents who are really clearly being impacted by that issue yeah one thing that residents do want to happen straight away there is for nzta to drop the speed limit on the motorway to reduce the noise um they were told at that meeting that this wouldn't make enough it wouldn't make a noticeable difference um but um as simon said duncan webb is following that up on behalf of those residents as a local mp that's us thank you I've noticed that council davidson's'd like included in the resolution which is requesting that I write to wakako tahi and request that the speed limit is temporary temporarily reduced to 60k until the final services service is added so from my understanding of the meeting the public were quite clear that when the when it was opened it was at a lower speed and it was um noticeably quieter than it was when the speed limit went yes and um they publicly have noticed that cars are going well over 100 at the moment so yeah bringing it down should and the second one is that I write to the minister of transport outlining council's concern with the current speed limit of the motorway and adverse effects on neighbouring residents but again I assume that is until the final service is added yeah okay um pauline I just want to assignment about the time frame for that second seal I know that nctea said it could commence in the spring or october but I thought they said it would be completed early next year are you sure they said a year you are I guess yeah we're only just into april so it's it's a year from now yep so okay um uh yeah a year from now it should all be uh yeah I thought you meant a year from when it's coming they it in spring and then it's obviously they've got the whole motorway to do plus qe2 drives yeah because that's relevant for the the time frame that we're asking for here so um yeah thank you um aaron a question around why the number of 60 and not 80 was selected I live 50 meters from an 80k state highway and it's it is a big difference from 100. right so that was why you chose no there's a little bit more to it than than that which I can talk to during my debate okay well it might be useful in terms of questions but I don't want to take away from the community board um but I might allow a couple of questions for of you mike as the I'm assuming that you're the total package right yeah okay well we'll come back because I've got questions of the community board so I'll just come back to you um on a separate matter is it yani it's this matter in a different matter yeah well can you deal with a different matter with the community board yeah okay um just the langdon road um issue with the traffic has there been any progress on that uh we're having a briefing next week from the um council engineer who's been looking into that so I'll have an update after that right but is it still up it's still a relevant live issue yes absolutely okay and did you have a question for the community board on yeah just on the um the highway or the northern motorway um I was just kind of interested if anyone's looked at the resource consent or the designation if there were any requirements around noise because I find it a bit weird that we're we're writing like normally there'd be construction and there'd be yeah and they have been doing testing um not at peak times noticeably um and there are some spot spots that are currently over that 57 but they say they'll come down hopefully once they put the final sale on so that requirement is when it's actually complete so there's nothing in the interim because I wonder whether when we're writing we should actually be trying to address this issue which has happened in other parts of the city as well is around when we're building or we're in an alliance or we're consenting that some thought is given to the transitional period before resurfacing happens so it doesn't we don't just keep getting into it we can take that on board when we address it I mean there's nothing in there that prevents that from being included mike did you want to just talk quickly on the oh just quickly so one of the questions that was asked during this whole process since the noise became an issue with would dropping it to adks make a difference now waka katahi two decibels and you won't notice it and they say you'll notice things after three disavows and if you actually go through all the information on their website actually reducing it from 100 to 70 has a 5 4.6 dispel drop um so it's clear that actually if we bring it down below 70 then we're actually so there's the graph that's from the nzta website which shows there's a clear drop if you go from 100 to 70. um so actually if we go past that 80 go right down to 60 then they're actually going to give a have a lot more uh effect to what's the noise at the moment it's causing yeah and of course that stops at a hundred um and that hasn't been my experience on there no it will need to be enforced it's an observation um so um so so I'll me being relatively ignorant so what's the current speed limit 100 it's 100 so you want to drop from 100 to 60. yeah keep it earlier a request that I write yeah no no just just for context I was trying to and the context will be put on the letter so that all of that um detail all right um so it's been moved and seconded so I'll open it up for debate pauline just wanted to touch on that um and thank you for the presentation it was very clear and good um on that meeting that I attended as well and the thing is that um a couple of things the residents pointed out was when a motorway is built in say auckland and it's within 200 metres of residential house they put up fences up there and they have they mitigate the noise and that question was posed to ncta and their response well was there's more cars on there than we have here and that really didn't go down that well because there's a reasonable number of cars using this motorway as well and more a bit more to come um so that was the other thing and somebody mentioned that there could be there solid fencing um so they may look at mitigating it in that way um also the fact that they measured the decibels within 200 metres of the motorway whereas many of these people lived 650 metres away they were having to have their doors and windows closed because of the roaring noise they were really really stressed about this and saying that their windows and doors are also rattling as the cars speed by so they've been really really negatively impacted by this and also as emma pointed out the the monitoring has been done um between 10 am and 5 pm which is a little bit unfair because the traffic does begin at look I don't know 6 30 probably so I just wanted to highlight those points that people were very very angry very upset and they were there first and this motorway has been imposed on them so um now that the government has brought the well-beings back in to the local government act I think we've got a bit of leverage there to try and get some some sympathy for these people and helpful so thanks leanne for doing that um I would have been very supportive of 80k I myself live 50 meters from state highway one and uh when we went through this process and had the temporary fruit and it broke up something terrible down there they've had a bit better luck on this one um and with the vehicles going past the 80k you don't notice it so I would have been a lot happier with 80 versus 60. it seems a very big jump from the current 100 and that road is flowing really well admittedly to the detriment of those neighbours right now until that seal's done so um I would have preferred would ask for 80 or we asking for 60 to try and get to 80. yeah we're in debate yeah that's all yeah I know that it sounds like a a really big drop but it will have a really big impact the reality is that when people are driving on this road everyone always takes into account that 10k buffer um that you know they're going to for 60 hopefully will mean that people travel under 70 and while the road surface is currently unfinished without its proper sort of state highway type top seal and a quiet surface seal I think that that's a really reasonable thing to ask for that that they do that um so state highway one um that runs near councillor kieran's place will have that um proper seal already and this road just doesn't yet really briefly I'm happy to support it um and I only do that because we're not making the decision it's only a letter to the transport experts who will consider it so I get exactly what you're saying aaron but in the end they'll take on this advice amongst everything else and and this is only a consideration it's we're not making a decision today mike do you want to close off today yeah just quickly and obviously there's quite a few things mentioned in the report um and so but what we are seeing I guess in the area is the um impact of's having on local community if you look at langdon's road and the massive development that's actually occurring out there and how that's impacting residents and then the motorway we always knew that it was going to have a big impact on st albans which was seen I think this was a little bit more of a surprise and but actually when we attended that meeting there was a lot of people there and they were all very they were frustrated they were angry they were tired um it was it was very compelling what they were saying and that was the liv experience they were living with it and some of them were quite fun from the motorway and they were could not sleep because of the noise that was coming off it you know that was presented by a few officials and I just don't think they were quite listening to what the people actually was were saying and for them to to actually say they actually won't notice a difference if we if we drop the speed when actually their own information this is only a small stretch it's not the whole motorway it's just a red cliff road where pretty much the residential is all all finished so it's not going to have a massive effect on travel time but it will have a massive impact a positive impact on the people that are living around there suffering from this noise that's coming off of the motorway like sam said it's just a request I really hope that he listens to it actually understands that this could be a solution um for a short period of time until the the seal is surface is applied and maybe it may speed them up a bit too to get it done quicker thanks thank you thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much

well accepted by the community and um so that's yeah we're going to be doing a bit more of that this term as well we're following in the footsteps of our cashmere sprayed and community board so and after that we had the meeting on the um a meeting about the residents concerns about um the john patterson uh yeah the rich medev and the john patterson intersection and um there was a lot of there's been a lot of emails flying around um about that for quite some time and we did have a meeting um straight when the road first opened and then we've had another meeting since then to see how the effects were because coming from a motorway um into a 40k area is is quite an issue so we just really really wanted to hear what the community have said um the the staff came and did a an excellent presentation of the uh the issues how they were seen and and they public they're going to come back with three other um options for tidying up other anomalies india or other problems at it so it was a really successful meeting okay so that's um yeah now the um the did we click on the next yes this was the first so the great the greater hornby residents association organized um the great easter egg hunt and it was also um sponsored by the lolly shop in hornby so excellent they had um the three three parks in our in our ward branston park broomfield common and denton park so that was a really really exciting event and well run by the community for the community so that's much appreciated what's the space because there'll be more of that to come the next one please if there is a next one is that the lot well I'd just like to follow up by saying um the community garden awards were held last night and it was a very very well attended very well attended there was about 180 odd people um actually came to receive that and the staff did a great job of putting that on so and that was another you know a good thing in an award but following the two presentations this morning on the um on the quarry issue one of the things is we've got we've got e ken saying um when we present presented it's a christchurch city council issue it's a land use consent um that is that is an issue so what we really want what I'm pleading with is can we please get a a plan change can we please get a plan change so that we can get these issues sorted and get a closer relationship with please with um with christchurch city council on the land use and ecan you know look the the chief executives just whispered in my ear that obviously the relationship between the two is the same I've already just explained that we cannot get a plan change on this matter we put up a proposal for a buffer zone which was rebuffed by the independent hearings panel so we don't have the I'm I'm not going to take um a submission from the community board based on a report that hasn't actually been debated by the um by by the um you know I mean it is not a matter that is in front of us today so um there is obviously issues that need to be followed up in terms of the close relationship between the council and ecan in terms of enforcement but um and and I will come and uh uh make sure that people are given the opportunity to understand what the what the key barriers are to changing the act but you've just heard the resource management act is all changing so I don't I don't want to I don't want to spend any more time on it now there's a lot of uh work that needs to be done in order to explain it and they were able to say no I I'd rather not have a discussion I unders lodge a plan change it will take two years and it will be a long journey and we tried to get this rule written again and and and and in two years and if we fail what will we have achieved apart from a vast amount of expenditure on expert advice and a decision that will not change the plan well I don't think that's I don't think that's where you have been asked to report on your council activity your community board activities and we have been this is an activity we have been involved in yeah and can I just say on another issue on air quality which is um ecam's issue mike and I went out with a resident one day it's three years ago a long time ago and and and the actual air was filled with particles which you could could actually see and in my experience with ecam they're not the residents say when they phone up and complain the ecam officer does not come out no no I'm yeah so so that's an issue I can take I've got a degree of irritation happening around the table um we have um in relation to the relationship between the council and ecan so if we could just leave it there would work and would you like to move the acceptance of the report second quickly speak to it thank you very much thank you cook debate yep all right have you got a question no no we're in debate it's moved second sorry well it was just a question on helen's point was around is that when it's which wind is that oh no I'm I'm sorry I i just I just moved us we have the same issue in our ward when there's a norwegian they don't just don't turn up this and then you ring them and kneecam will say we've got two officers it's a noise wind I'll give you 100 we have already said that we will ask the chief executive to raise the enforcement issues with ecam because it is it does sit with them we can put it in our submission yes yeah yes we've got a submission to ecan on the it's very quick just to say that we are putting in an ltp submission to ecan the need to have an activity level of service about how they respond to complaints about air quality I would encourage everyone that's concerned today to please make submissions to econ on their long-term plan asking for a level of service about responsiveness to air quality complaints we've already got it in our submission we have put it in and we'll certainly be speaking to it later today thank you thank you jimmy thank you the the host will home be raised uh the victim coming for to uh present to us so positive things particularly I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the the the chair of the community born this time is a total difference from the previous 10th this time actually working together collaboratively also working together with the community so they raise this kind of issue the cultural galo will be successful particularly over the last 22 years hongbi the the center might understand even now every day have people pass through to monitor complete the facility for the wider homebay area a nice stream wine now we just sift those community board meetings to the nigerian primary school it can attract more local people can turn out less good the change but it's changing there's actually a transformation but regarding to community ball and the two kind of of the residents you know the particular on behalf of the community to raise this issue this is a big issue because they already get some evidence you know these uh the crystallized silicon or these pm10 they will affect the physical body you know this quite serious issue so my view now now will make the summation through the long term plan to the e-can also you know I encourage coming back and also community individually make the submission to the e-can we resolve the least problem as quickly as possible otherwise you know we can still not pay our responsibility because there's a particular critical health issue thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed thank you thank you thank you right I've got the
So could I have a special welcome to our um rs students they are undertaking a course of study that leads them into the tremendous and tremendously important world of the fourth estate and thank you very much for coming and observing our meeting today and I hope that you've felt that it's been an interesting start uh to the meeting so thank you right now we'll move on to uh deputations by appointment which we have none presentation of petitions also none and then we move on to minutes uh the minutes so if somebody would like to move uh those two minutes uh tim scandret seconded pauline cotter put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried the supplementary
Uh the uh we'll move on to public participation and we come to the public forum first and I have the pleasure of inviting saint john's christchurch um to come to the table alice earnshaw morris I believe is representing st john today thank you so much for coming here today and making the presentation thank you for all you do in the community so I'll hand over to you thank you very much for having me uh you'll need to turn your microphone on and you can sit down if you wish I tend to bounce around a little bit that's fine bounce around um so apologies so I am alice I am the area executive manager for st john christchurch I also as you can tell from the green uniform someone who turns up on the ambulances from time to time so today I'm going to talk to you about what we do in the community and what I would like from you as counselors so the reason I'm here today is because we are the provider of one of three provider of a huge number of community health initiatives and services that tend to fly under the radar so um what I'm actually here to do today is to ask each and every one of you from your mirror right down I want to build relationships with you I want to find out what is missing in your communities what we could be doing better in your communities each of your pieces of christchurch has really different needs and requirements I will add a small caveat here I'm used to giving this presentation over about an hour so I'm about to power talk at you um so apologies look internationally we're a huge organization we're approaching our 1000th birthday we have a medieval history that quite literally includes the knights hospitals um and right the way through to the fact that we used to have an island of malta you may have heard of it in the middle of the mediterranean that's why we actually have the maltese cross um we lost that uh in a siege with our favorite french villain napoleon and a little bit there we came back again under queen victoria um which is why we actually now have the regnal animals on our cigna insignia as well this is the only organization I have ever worked for that has two lions and two unicorns on its logo look the order of news in new zealand actually started here in christchurch so we are incredibly proud of our roots here in christchurch we started down at a hall off the side of saint mary's church in miraval now that's now known as all souls it's still there we're still connected to it we still have very strong ties into that community but we started off teaching first aid training we had nothing to do with ambulances at all christchurch back in 1885 had a paucity of medical practitioners so we were teaching people how to look after themselves we are an ngo which is sort of an odd historical discrepancy I guess when it comes to providing one of your three major emergency services but look it is what it is and as I talk through I will also point out we're a rather passionate bunch uh 40 of our paid staff across the country also hold at least one volunteer role I myself hold two volunteer roles within the organization which means essentially I have no life anymore um because I'm either on the ambulances at events or in my day job right so I'll start with what you do know about us this is the emergency ambulance service we actually have three ambulance services in christchurch people are only aware of the one and think it's all one so in christchurch I've got three stations the hub and nine spokes the spokes look like houses they are sign posted but they're very hard to find the reason for that is they are not manned stations this is not somewhere you can go and find help but they are scattered across the city the important piece for this conversation here though is the fact that I only have 15 vehicles across the city for emergency ambulance services I run 11 of them in the day 6 at night these 24 7 which means I have a small allowance in there for taking them off the road for servicing maintenance crashes you name it um when you're putting that number of vehicles out on the road constantly things do happen but we also run them incredibly hard you'll note that I have 140 volunteers who are on the ambulances in christchurch it's 140 people in your community who volunteer their time and energy to go and help people they have the same qualifications the same atps if you know authority to practices with nursing staff for example they do the same our volunteers have the same qualifications the same experiences they just do it for free and they're on key to what we do look our event ambulances is another team that we have these guys are static they're the ones who turn up to rugby games to qriket games to music concerts to wild food wine and food wrong city there for a second these guys are static if something goes wrong at that event they can't up and leave and take someone will call the emergency ambulance guys to come and pick them up and take them so every time we run an event for example um electric avenue a few weeks back if something goes horribly wrong at that event someone gets very sick when you take them to hospital we are pulling emergency ambulances one of those 15 vehicles off the road to come and pick that up and take them the third ambulance crew that we have in christchurch is a weird one uh look it's a team of specialist staff who deal with transferring patients between facilities so this is post people who have had post surgery who are going from christchurch hospital to birwid for rehabilitation or the other way round of surgery at burwood did not go according to plan we need them back into christchurch hospital or going from one of our private facilities into christchurch into christchurch hospital as well um just so you know that that exists they do look quite different look in terms of our funding we are currently 78 funded by central government that's through contracts with ministry clear with you that 78 is only for the emergency ambulance service not the other two anything else that I talk about after this point is not covered by that funding so we are less than 80 funded to provide our ambulance service the bulk of the shortfall comes through uh donations from the community we're running annual appeal this week we will be shaking buckets to buy ambulances and pay for staff tomorrow and saturday please give to us we really need it right things you don't know about us we run youth divisions in christchurch we have 500 cadets these are kids from six years of age through to 18 run 11 groups in christchurch to do this this is essentially a youth program the cheapest one you'll find in the country but this is essentially life skills leadership skills and a very generous helping of health a lot of our kids move into uh medical professions of some sort whether it's allied health paramedicine or uh going to be doctors and surgeons this is a great starting point for them we're also of our staff once they leave we have a social and service group for retired staff my eldest member is 92 in christchurch george has given 79 years of service to the organization and to your communities and he is still active it's really impressive but we don't drop them we keep this as part of a prevention of social isolation uh these people stay with us um and continue to provide service to the community moving on community care things that you may have seen us do we have volunteers in the emergency department at christchurch hospital these guys provide the caring support that the ed staff cannot so ed are busy there trying to stop you vomiting patch up the bleeding all the rest of it our volunteers in there actually say are you all right you've been here for four hours now with your mum do you need a cup of tea is your mum cold does she need a blanket they can do the personal caring that the ed staff simply don't have time for and we don't expect them to've also got the pediatrics I'm about to start in the next couple of months in new zealand first of having these volunteers in our intensive care unit as well at the request of the canterbury district health board so we'll be moving through for that we also run kieran caller that's picked up dramatically over covert obviously this is a social isolation phone based service where we match people up and provide friendship therapy pets this is starting that's moose moose no longer works for us but he's a very cool dog um we've this is a growing service we're currently in aged eight five aged care facilities in christchurch our wait list for this is bigger than we can match at the moment but this is essentially just another recruitment drive for volunteers and their dogs this goes through an amazing process to sort out the wheat from the chaff before we let them go anywhere but this is essentially friendship pets um we'll be moving into primary schools to help with reading programs as well for children right as save lives from when they are early childhood education through to cpr and high schools these programs started as a pilot program an initiative here in christchurch and is now rolled out nationwide um and we've had a lot of uh lives saved by our kids um we're just extending this at the moment we started off focusing purely on cpr processes we're now teaching them how to recognize strokes and react to that as well through the fast acronym thinking of kids in schools we are also starting to work on mental health and mental wellbeing this is a particular program that we are aiming at our intermediate aged children um these these both these programs sorry are free to schools um this is part of what we do as our charity all these things are what we do as our charity work but this is about the fact that an intermediate aged children have some real issues around building resilience strong relationships and a strong sense of self-identity you also in the mental health stats that keep flying around this is some of the work at the pass we are looking for a partner this is being run as a pilot and getting very good reception around the country but we're looking for a partner organisation to help fund it so that we can roll it out and have it be free to schools these are going to turn up this is how we do some of our funding um medical alarms you've seen the ads for these this is what keeps people in their own homes about a third of these calls that come through to us are accidental activations however we can actually turn up and check on people and make sure they're fine uh first aid training this is where we started this is what we still offer we teach everything from babysitting courses through to advanced resuscitation skills for health practitioners we cover the works um oh and we have a mental health first aid course as well everything else that we do uh look we're running a whole lot of pilot programs um we have because of the fact that we started in christchurch we've the country but we're also doing work around getting aeds into communities and teaching the communities cpr for free so we're working quite closely with the otahi community housing trust at the moment and getting getting places into them um I think that's me yeah well done well done you know thank you very much and um I think what you've demonstrated is that there is an incredible you know breadth and depth to what you do and uh I think it is a really helpful reminder especially as you go into your campaign for your fundraiser this weekend uh just to remind people how much you do um you know rely on the generosity of not only your own volunteers but of others who will financially contribute and as I said when I started ideally what we're looking to do is actually to reach out to each and every one of you and say can we actually sit down and talk with you can we talk about what's happening in your communities can we talk about what is needed what is missing where a better meeting to make that point too because you've got every chair of the every community board sitting in behind they're presenting their reports today and I know that they are going to welcome st john's you know directly relating to them at the community board level and I know that they will all have issues that they will want to raise with you we want to hear them we want to know about it we can't help if we don't know what's going on and sometimes we get our kids a little bit stuck in the emergency ambulance service in terms of our immediate focus well I really appreciate you reaching out today really appreciate your presentation and I know that the community boards and I'll just ask all councillors to join with me and thanking you and the way that I think and good luck for your fundraising this weekend that's annoying but never mind yeah um but thank you very much for having me thank you thank you very much thank you right uh and the next lamb juice thank you the mps regarding productive land is hugely relevant only five percent of the available land in this country is luc one to two class oil and only 14 percent of the land is lucy one to three with all three classes versatile with high potential for productivity the land shown north of state highway one is coded the blue areas boarded in red are luc one to three land and the green boxed areas are those indicated in a 2014 report to council regarding quarry rehabilitation and the green boxed areas are sites identified by the industry as being potential sites and the blue boxed area was consented in 2020 all sites are fully inclusive or significantly inclusive of luc one to three lan valuable soil is removed through quarry rehabilitation in this region is not undertaken in a timely manner and we also know it's likely to mostly be in the form of just 30 centimeters of soil which is grassed very close to aquifers which may rise due to climate change issues pastural use and grass growing is the only viable option food be consented as an activity on hpl there are alternatives for these sites and yes they may be a few cases further away from the end use but there are alternatives there will be claims from the industry to justify the use expect claims of increased carbon footprint instead of the usual handwringing of increased transport costs well the answer is this they should lead the way in investing in and investigating alternative forms of transport including the electrification of fleets in this fast-moving technological space including on-site use the supreme court has said outright avoidance is a response that is legitimately available under the rma therefore no no consent should be considered on hpl regardless of what mitigation or remediation is proposed by the industry it's likely to be unproven and come with higher risk with 23 to 30 years of aggregate currently available in this region the environment should be sustainably managed in advance of the nps being gazetted provisions are already applicable in the rps and have been for some time my second request is for setbacks from quarrying activities to be applied that will offer under the health act to protect or improve health and this starts with where activities are permitted and the land use consent falls at the feet of ccc and I will add today that he can have kicked that can well and truly into your backyard I'm asking that one kilometer is considered for the following reasons mitigation measures used are poor water is the measure of choice which is limited in effectiveness but it's free to the operator technology is available used elsewhere that utilizes water but will include dust collection systems covered operations and out of hours ongoing mitigation currently non-existent but wind does not abide by quarry operating times and easter sunday was proof of this with regular high winds in this region pm10 and smaller can and does disperse high distances and certainly beyond 500 meters claims of lower distances by applicants are not substantiated compliance monitoring response and investigation is woeful and may indicate a breach of the health act there is no deterrent for operators to ensure they do not impact on those in the vicinity queries do not operate in isolation cumulative effects which when combined are significant for those in the vicinity the carp indicated a cow bomb would be one kilometer from a residential zone a more significant setback than that for a quarry and additionally residential property owners must be given the same rights as those in residential zones being treated differently amounts to discrimination which is not provided for in the health act this council sets the ball rolling with where the quarry is cited tipping that first domino so please can I ask that you do the right thing for your residents current setbacks have proved to be ineffective particularly when super quarries involving several operators do become the norm thank you thank you very much um your submissions covered uh the um air quality issue which I think you've submitted to ecan on is that right I have but they did rightly point out the sighting of the quarries is that first domino it's where it's cited which does have a big impact and that falls in there and as you'll know the the district plan was completely rewritten uh by was um a post-earthquake land use recovery plan process uh and it was a um and this particular issue we are all very well aware of because uh the council as an organisation uh had to submit based on the level of expertise that they brought to the issue uh the council laws didn't agree with that and we we looked for a an expert who could provide independent expert advice to the independent hearings panel to increase the setback between quarries and residential so we totally agree the independent hearings panel didn't agree with our position with our expert and they accepted um the other submissions that they had received and so the setbacks are not um as what they're not sufficient in our view but we can't change our district plan um to achieve any any greater setbacks we tried and we were not successful in achieving that so we really appreciate the issue um but the the solution isn't here but we do agree that ecan's role in monitoring the conditions of the resource consent as applied to air quality are um we will ask our chief executive to uh raise this with ecam to make sure that the monitoring processes are the best that they can be because you're entitled to that so that that's that's where I have to leave things because um can I just ask um would uh part or subsection e of section 23 of the health fact be applicable where you can impose bylaws no it takes health it's not it's not applicable it's in relation to the relation to other health matters but air quality sits with ecan not with the city council but I think you know that I think the the issue for us here and we want to move this forward in a positive way is to make sure that our council is an organization is ensuring that the that we present to the to ecan which is the which is the monitoring organisation to make sure that they are actually um enforcing what are resource consent conditions they are obliged to do that so thank you very much for your presentation this morning thank than that yeah the residents are just going to be ending up taking legal action as an only recourse I think that's all they've got really true thank you right and we've got um the uh ross is that um I'm lost I'm not pronouncing your name is this philistine paulistan so is this is it spelt h-o-u-l-i-s t o india yeah so it was it was misspelt in front of me that's why I was having difficulty with it right thank you now I'm research submissions officer for the greater hornby residents association and we fully support the fact that the rma is just a joke an absolute standing joke in the way it has worded at the current time and there is room for it to be improved and needs investigating however today I've got this here all luc one two three land and the christchurch city boundary should be excluded from quarrying operations it is productive land quarrying is non-productive it is destructive straight out destructive while commissioners are proving individual quarry operations as being less than minor effect less than minor when combined together we have instances in town road where between fulton hogan's and ablet's they cannot distinguish where the dust is coming from they are too close together they need shifting apart so the blame can be put in place these facts have been tested in the environment caught and upheld ghra are currently undertaking dust monitoring and this will remain ongoing into the foreseeable future this time there are negotiations with suppliers in australia usa and china these monitors must be robust enough to stand up and court proceedings were remaining mobile so they can be located to various sites somewhat bewildering to see three authorities the city council ecan and the cdhb bearing the heads in crystalline silica sand and leave them more prominent parts exposed to the air over pm10 pm 2.5 dust the same attitude was taken with log fires which still have a serious smog issue difference here is that crystalline silica dust comes not only from crushed aggregate but also from the sand that aggregate lies in crystalline silica is also harder to see so is often ignored to ten kilometers crystalline silica also does not cause asthma but silicosis and other respiratory illnesses so in fact is far worse and more dangerous than any soot the quarry industry has long been suspected by many for its perceived lack of accountability or else they would have stepped up with the true facts instead of the lines they tend to distribute to distribu uh justify themselves what they say is true there'll be no setbacks in australia india or anywhere else in the world new zealand is way behind the times on this matter and a review of the rma act is well overdue queensland requires a two kilometer setback if over one thousand people live in a village while in india which is heavily populated requires one kilometer setback does this mean we now live in a fourth world situation it's our opinion these quarry operators have very deep pockets and very short arms when it comes to residents health and safety but the opposite when trying to buy within the city's boundary with quarries with earthquakes salvaging them often buried when it was meant in short the public in the western area of the city had been manipulated for long enough we've had constant complaints about levels of dust in our area dust issue has really come to the force since the earthquakes in the roberts road quarry opening when asked if complaints have been lies with cancel the replies you're just wasting your breath now I don't mean this particular council as such ecan as every bit is bad don't worry no one really listens to the complaints about quarries or past quarries such as those behind boston ave perhaps this dialogue needs further airing on fair go sometime in the future the greater hornby residents association believes no further quarrying operation should be approved between islington high high templeton and yeldhurst there is a block of land in there that is suitable for industrial development or residential development not quarrying in the meantime the greater hornby residents association requests a moratorium on all quarry consents and approvals from today forward under the current district plan so public health can be considered along with residents concerns regarding the ongoing this should be a full open as well as a transparent investigation moving forward any opposition from within the quarrying faction should be seen as merely merely trying to protect their patch so to speak while still ignoring residents concerns and health understanding orders I believe this request is not out of order saying that there is an aggregate supply equivalent to some 23 years without a decision on the roid inquiry application which is currently before the employment court so delay is not a factor thank you thank you thank you ross look it's I think you've heard what I've said to the previous submitter that um it's an inappropriate phrase but we're between a rock and a hard place um you know when you're talking about quarrying um it is it and and you have talked about the um the resource management act the government has announced that there are significant changes coming uh the but I don't want people to have um an unrealistic expectation of what that might open up by way of um public involvement and decisions around as open about this as I possibly can I do note that the national policy statement for highly productive land has not yet been brought into effect it is still a draft they are still working on the detail of it we submitted on it in 2019 so it is um it's obviously been a process that hasn't led to something that I personally was very much looking forward to which was to find some protection from the law from the development inappropriate development or use of highly productive land but so you've raised serious issues I'm actually thinking I'm coming to uh visit the greater hornby residents in the very near future so I'm now well prepared with a set of um questions that I'm obviously going to be asked to answer on that day so but thank you very much I hope you've taken some comfort from the fact that the chief executive will follow up with he can no so that is good thank you based on the ross and also the wiener the kind of the uh the a responsibility to review also section 23 of the health act and the children look I know how passionate you are you are the best representative for a council area that you could possibly imagine but I just don't want I i don't I don't care who else I offend around the table but but but but jimmy jimmy wants to make the point you you've made the point jimmy and that I'm going to be meeting with the greater hornby residents association I doubt that they will mind if you come with me and um and we'll we'll we'll follow it up with them but I think people do need to clearly understand the limitations um in our resource management system we do um we do and and and I know that you understand that we have been we have been trying within the parameters of the framework that we have to work to as well but we'll continue to work together as much as we possibly can so if I may say um yeah we have as you know limited to ecan and the city council it is um prosecutable under the crimes act yeah and that may come literally eventually let's all take that offline because we we do want to get the outcome yeah so thank you very much ross for for um making yourself available um this morning and um thank you very much for your presentation thank you thank you thank you and at the
Uh now I have um no apologies at this stage although there may be for early departure from uh james yani unsurprisingly is apology for late arrival um right so would someone like to move those two melanie seconded by jimmy chen I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried I've got declarations of interest councillor golf for public excluded item 28 and I've got uh tim scandret for the item and the mia's report that relates to vinI's otatahi thank you the
Seriously something in the water isn't there this week what are you doing everyone welcome to the twee committee meeting and I'm just going to ask um councillor daniels to open for us with the cutter so apologies today we have apologies for lateness from oh jake's here so I'll take you off melanie coca and catherine chew this apology for lateness and sam you may be only if we're not finished by midday but I'm sure we will be um all right three hours to move some minutes strange things have happened sam we'll leave it for lateness now and if she doesn't arrive we can change it that's okay is it yeah I'm in early departure I think we'll be done we've only got the three waters thanks phil so are you moving the apologies then okay thank you seconded aaron all those in favor say aye against that's carried the troublemaker is on right sarah and leanne yeah okay so just be vigilant of declarations of interest please let us know if you have have a mover tim seconded sam put that motion all those in favor say aye aye against that's carried public forum there is none deputations none today petitions none so item seven is the minutes of the waimakariri zone committee so they've that's actually four sets of minutes for some reason they came through the september october november and march minutes and um the minutes from the other committees were not ready at the time of the report so they'll be coming probably next next month is that right david okay so we have a movie for those minutes oh okay siri have a question um so many of our subordinate organisations community boards without their councillors um do submissions um donald trump you know it's a council organisation we point someone to it they are ian thompson for that one see I'm happy to go away and come back with some advice on that as quickly as because time obviously is matching on in terms of the otp process thank you this has taken so long um well it's just it's had in the last meeting fair enough um the only thing is that our next meeting's not till have you got any idea how long it might take by the end of the week oh easy okay yep thanks ian I mean do we need to do a resolution no look you've asked for the advice I'll provide I think so too and look um he thinks sarah I think that's a good move and on page 23 it talks about flood risk on the northern side of waimakariri I assume it's the northern side of waimakariri I'm not sure but I'm just wondering that since that zone committee looks at flood risk I'm wondering why um I don't recall christchurch west melton ever looking at flood risk and I know it's an ecan project the stock banks but I'm just wondering james if you might take that back to the zone committee next meeting and just ask do they look at the flood risk in the stock banks for the waimakariri that's great and I also note concluded on the 26th of february and ecan are expected to make a decision in june or july 21 so that will be interesting okay so I'd have a mover for those minutes anyway andrew seconded um jimmy put that motion oh and our interview with a question just around the um the stop banks didn't_''_1819.919 we have a full presentation here around the stock banks already a long time ago um how long ago do you think well just in the last couple of years I would have thought what was it or did we get that at our community board I thought we got it here oh myself all right okay but they have been here but it was a long time ago it was up it was more than two years ago right okay no worries all right I don't think there's any change just so everyone knows thanks all those in favor say aye all right all right that's carrie okay welcome helen we'll move on to your um three waters by monthly report item eight you want to note a couple of things so first of all that water reform has been continuing with some pace and I know that both elected members and staff have been engaging with various workshops around the country so there's work going on in the governance space and the design of any proposed new entities there's work going on in the regulatory space with the the new rules and standards so that's the new maximum acceptable values and of course the um the water services bill is on its way through select committee and this council went up and made a submission on that also just to note that the stimulus fund program is continuing and we've made good progress in terms of the wastewater mains those builds are you know mostly underway the water supply mains where all of the detailed design work has been completed and construction will begin in the next couple of months and there's a change process that's been put out by department of internal affairs as well so one of the major projects that we'd put up we now works uh and that there's a change process where we can substitute some other work and you won't be surprised to hear that we are proposing to put up a couple of reservoirs to accelerate the reservoir program in terms of helen was that all in that tranche one funding you're talking about yes all on the trench one funding yeah so that's in the 40 million that's come across and that's to be delivered by march 2022 in terms of the um the water services bill the the council submission focused on a risk-based approach compared to the mandatory residual disinfection which means chlorine also talked about the importance of source protection and the fact that our very high quality groundwater means that mandatory physical treatment is not necessary here in christchurch either so there were some key points in the um in the bill that were just brought to the attention of the committee in that oral submission and there were some good questions um as a result of those submissions as well so I thought it was a very good process and some themes emerging that I think we might see some change in the bill and I think that's particularly around the the small supplies so the um the number of councils who are concerned about responsibility for small supplies coming onto the territorial authorities is huge and the number of those small suppliers has exceeded anyone's expectations so they started out thinking there were 5 000 of them their next estimate was around 20 to 30 000 and now they think there might be more than 70 000 of them around the country so it's um that's a it's a big ask uh the other thing to note I think is um just incidents in terms of resource consents and we did have an incident in saint albans creek where sediment laden water was released from a construction site that was reported to environment canterbury we haven't had any enforcement action taken but we have taken remedial action and instructed our contractor to um to comply with those consent conditions so the the the responsibility of counsel and the responsibilities of contractors is've been doing some training as well for our project managers to make sure that they are they are upskilled and they're more proactive in this space the water safety plans in terms of progress the christchurch water safety plan as you know was submitted just before christmas and the drinking water assessors from why comply have been going through the process of reviewing that and we've got two workshops set up in april with staff to explore any issues and any questions that they have so that that is still a work in progress we don't we don't actually have a timeline for when they'll when they'll sign that off there is a statutory timeline but um I don't think that will apply at all in terms of transgressions there were no transgressions and for drinking water quality in the last couple of months but of course we did have the major incident at akara with dead animals being discovered in that reservoir so that that happened early in february and we put the boil water notice on and then the tankers put a temporary reservoir tank farm in place so the um the tank farm was commissioned middle of march and then 18th of march that boil water notice was lifted and now of course we're looking at a um a permanent reservoir replacement there we are likely once we've um drained and had a look at that old reservoir we're likely to put it back in service but as a raw water reservoir so we'll use it to to balance takes from the streams and have raw water and then from there it'll go into the treatment plant and have two new treated water reservoirs at the other end of that treatment plant so that's that work is underway uh just uh as you mentioned plan change seven in terms of the land water regional plan we have stepped up our nitrate monitoring across the district and you'll see that we are seeing a trend of increasing nitrates in our aquifers these the nitrate levels are nowhere near the maximum acceptable value however we do want to monitor these and keep an eye changes to that maximum acceptable value so at the moment it's a chronic exposure limit that protects babies however the recent research may mean that a um sorry at the moment it's an acute one it may be a chronic one that comes in for that research and the association with um with colorectal cancer so we'll keep we'll keep an eye on that and we'll report back to you on the next round for that in terms of water supply operations water demand is tracking at about its usual level we have had um high demand over the summer and we have had water restrictions in place particularly over on banks peninsula so some banks peninsula settlements are still at level four so that's a complete housing ban and that is because of the the very dry summer we've had and indeed an extraordinarily dry march so there's there's no prospect of lifting those restrictions anytime soon we do need some significant rain over there before we can do that just a note that the temporary chlorine equipment continues to is working outstandingly well so we're very pleased with that with that installation uh we've got a notion there about response times for water service requests so those we'll keep those up to date so that you can monitor the trends there but we have now seen a sustained improvement in those response times so responding to to both urgent and non-urgent water leaks and repairs and outages so that is good to see one of the other things you'll notice is we've put in some operational grafts of the monitoring that we do at our major treatment plant out at bromley and we'll we'll we'll play around with what information we're giving you here but what we're wanting to do is is give you some um some better oversight really of how the operation of that plant is going and how we're trending in terms of the consent compliance for that discharge so there's some information there and we're happy to take any feedback on that and what's useful and what's not and we more visually pleasing and easier to read than these that drop out of the instrumentation but we've got some it's got some graphs in there just the major things that we monitor being the biological oxygen demand um suspended solids e coli and total coliforms from that plant so everything is is running well but it's um I think it's good for you to see how well rather than just take our assurances that that's in place another thing to note in terms of um wastewater management is that we have just completed um a modeling exercise of our wet weather overflow flow compliance and the reason we do that by modelling is that the wet weather is not predictable year on year so our system has to comply with a um with a modeled frequency of overflows and that can be of course calibrated by observing overflows in particular events and those compliance statistics are indicating that we've got um we've got a few issues in some parts of the city and that is going to inform the um the capital program moreover we're predicting more overflows wet weather overflows then then the consent allows and we'll do those we'll do those works and there are also some operational changes that we've made to ensure that we remain within compliance I think the only other thing I would draw your attention to would be the capital program which is largely continuing as predicted there are there are a few projects that have been deferred and some other projects that have been brought forward for various reasons and some of them are around availability of parts from overseas so we've still got some issues in terms of covert in the lockdown and some parts that are taking a little time to come through mostly affecting littleton wastewater I'm happy to take questions oh it's a very comprehensive report helen thank you very much right we'll take questions um andrews in yani thank you I've got um three questions on three different matters um so the akaroa reservoir issue um thanks for the update and thanks also for coming out to akuro and fronting that so thanks to you and staff for doing that um one of the a lot of the questions the community asked at that meeting we responded by saying there's an enquiry there's an inquiry underway um and once we've got a report back from that inquiry we'll be able to provide further information are you able to update on the status of the inquiry and how we intend to feed back to the community yes so um our own internal risk and audit group so sean dowse has conducted a review of the incident and the response and his final report has just been lodged with dawn this week so we'll be able to report to you we can do it by memo if you like rather than wait till the next twee meeting so that report once it's gone through dawn is that able to be shared with councillors uh yes I think it probably could or at least the conclusions and recommendations could there are some there are some sort of staff disciplinary matters involved which we would prefer to keep confident about processes uh to to improve which which yeah I find to be shared yeah and then will you be turning your mind to how we communicate that back to the community yes we will thank you um second matter um page 66 um leo kanes bay water supply um clearly investigations have led to a um a thought that there may need to be further um and may need to be more budget for this um looking at the timing in the last annual plan we deferred this to financial year 22. is there anything that we need to consider as part of the current ltp um finalization or would any changes be able to be taken to into account with the next annual plan I would prefer the letter so at the moment yes there are some changes to the design of the treatment plant given the the analytical work that's been undertaken in in terms of the stream and the water quality from those streams so once we have those changes we'll know what the budget implications are and yes they can be accommodated through or a staff suggestion for the um 2022 annual plan yes if we exceed the budget that's available in the long term plan okay thank you and then um final question the water supply reticulation renewals program we had received briefings in the past and some matters have been highlighted relating to lead jointed pipes particularly in the older suburbs of the city to what extent is this program prioritizing that work on renewal of those lead jointed pipes so the um the cast iron lead jointed pipes are a very small proportion of our total reticulation so they're less than five percent of the total articulation and only a very small proportion of that causes us problems so it's only where those lead jointed mains are have a dead end and the water sits in the main and then can accumulate levels of lead that are of concern so we we have targeted those rather than than change the prioritization of the whole program what we've done is we've targeted those dead-end mains and there are nine of them which are currently scoped I couple of others are underway so we're replacing those dead-end mains I think that's a matter of priority given that that had been raised as a matter of priority in previous reports it might be good for that to be closing the loop so that we can see when that works done I'll just be getting an update on that particular um part of the program so um so what we're doing is we're continuing the monitoring program across the city to identify where we've got those where we've got the lead jointed mains where we've got the dead ends and where that does result in an increase in lead in the water and that's a smaller proportion again so even having a lead jointed main and a dead end doesn't mean that you've got concerning levels of lead but in some places they are approaching half of the mev or even the mav in one sample in that 24-hour sequence that we talked about last time but what we're going to do is we'll put together those mains and the program for replacement and we'll bring that to you so you've got the whole thing in one report excellent thank you so when will that be how long will it be the next three three yeah we can bring that to the next toy meeting or again we can bring it by memo if you like so that reports in draft at the moment memo is probably okay I think all right thank you we'll also update the website because we do have those um those lead mains mapped on the website so we can put an update on the website so it's available for the public good thank you so yani and then I think leanne you have one too and then jimmy oh thank you um just just getting back to the issue of the water safety plan and when we can remove the temporary chlorination so I was just trying to understand like um in one of the sections of the report it talks about that all of our wells have basically been um so sorry this is page secured by the expert in wellhead security uv treatment has been installed this is sufficient to supply christchurch children harbour brooklyn's kanga and wai nui almost entirely from water from sakura wells so just trying to get my head around it so basically the thing that we said we would do to take temporary clawing out under the old water safety plan we've done everything it's the new things that they've added since um with the new water safety plan that we've submitted that includes backplot backflow prevention is is that basically correct so yes so there's there's three things that are driving the use of chlorine in the network one is um where we have a wellhead that that well almost all of our wellhead's now been upgraded as as you note right but not all of them were signed off by the drinking water assessor so where they um have been signed off by the drinking water assessor there is no chlorine and that includes as you noted brooklyn's kayanga and some parts of parklands in the northwest and no chlorine there it's got those well heads have been upgraded and they've been signed off by the drinking water assessor and there are no issues with the backflow or the reservoirs which we'll come to where the wellheads have been upgraded but not signed off by the drinking water assessor the chlorine has been reduced from either one part per million or 0.5 per million whatever the dose was at that pump station down to 0.2 parts per million so it's been reduced but not removed because we haven't got the sign off from the drinking water assessor sorry just to be clear we've got the sign off from an expert so from an expert in wellhead assessment effectively under the old water safety plan that we had that was current before we submitted the new one that would have been adequate to stop chlorination no under the old water safety plan we had a double sign-off process we did with the drinking water assessor that's right and that that was that was progressing through the wellheads and then at a certain and have we had any conversations about um whether we could sign off those from the drinking water assessor given that it's like exactly the same risk except as the assessor will not sign off those well heads so now the office the the risk is now to be managed through the new water safety plan and as you noted in the new water safety plan there is we we continue to have residual chlorine present where we have um not fully resolved the back focus was all I was trying to understand like we've got current infrastructure that we've had signed off by the experts that the drinking water assessor approved and said that's okay yes I think we've just said is that in those zones the back flow wasn't an issue we've done all the work around backflips at the backflow and the stuff that's remaining there's nothing in there that would be the same as the ones that have already been signed off because of the backflow that's correct so essential that basically the main zone where get we're we're working on the central zone um and also the um the west zone and some of rickettson and also our fairy medium so are there any of those zones that we'll get the backflow stuff done within a time frame where we might be ahead of the others and we could ask for them to be the chlorine to be lifted we could ask but I doubt that we would get them because we we have agreed with the ministry of health that the um that the risk will be managed through the new water safety plan and through the sign off of the new water safety plan it's the new water safety plan that identifies the backflow issue and the reservoir issue and it's the new water safety plan that we're waiting on approval for right but if it's such a risk um with the backflow in place in those zones where we've upgraded the wellheads then why don't they force us to chlorinate temporary chlorine in the other areas that we don't currently have it so when we resolve the backflow in the new zones why wouldn't they sign it off so it's we're going on a bit of a circular argument so we're sort of we're operating under we're operating under two water safety plans if you like we're operating under our approved water safety plan for the wellheads and we're operating under our um proposed water safety plan for the backflow and the reservoirs so okay but just in terms of the backflow so when's the timeframe we're expected to get that work complete for the whole city well we're doing it zone by zone and most of the work should be completed by the end of june uh in those zones there may be some outstanding ones where they're technically difficult um but certainly by the end of the year all of the backflow work will be complete so is is it and then there's the age testing of the water which is the other issue is that being sorted now the age testing of the water is still that's associated with it so there's basically no chance of getting chlorination out in the meantime so it's already out in some parts of the city well under the old plan under the old plan yes and where where we resolve um backflow and reservoirs it's backed off to the point too and if the wellheads have got the double sign-off it comes out there as well so oh sorry all I'm trying to understand like if we get the certain zones backflow done rather than wait for the groundwater testing and and the other zones to be complete is there any opportunity to stop the temporary chlorination in certain zones if we get all the work done if we've got double sign-off on the wells yes yeah if we haven't got double sign-off on the wells then it's no and has the drinking water assessor definitely said that they won't give double sign-off until we get the water safety plan approved that's great and so when are we looking to get the little safety plan approved that is a april and after the workshops in april we'll have a much better idea of where the questions are from the drinking water assessors great yeah it just seems like we're going around the circles with them it is a very difficult process I mean I understand there are now three approved in the country and given that there are hundreds of water supplies operated by councils that's a very small number so yes it is a very difficult process to get a water safety plan approved okay so would you keep us updated and just dent it just two other questions one is um the water supply or the water integrated water strategy that's not picked up in this report the integrated water strategy no I haven't_''_3202.559 said anything about the integrated water strategy in this report so we've got an outstanding resolution on the rain water and I just was trying to ah yes so yes you've got an outstanding resolution about rainwater um rainwater tanks and greywater tanks yeah yes there's a memo being drafted um by our friends and planning people and from the operational people about that and then we'll bring that to you right and and will we have a chance to discuss options for for looking at that and what we can do like district planning or certainly okay that would be that would be cool um and the only other question was we did raise questions about denton as well is there a audit of denton or what happened there or there will be yes there'll be an incident report for denton so denton's operating in bypass at the moment and we're doing the repair work on that reservoir right okay cool so would the rain rain water and great water tanks um fit in with the bylaw work at all it should do um so if it does we need to try and we need to get the options back on what we can do yeah I'm just looking at the timing yes okay I guess my concern is that if we don't get the information ahead of the ltp that if we want to do stuff we's why I'm getting it yep yep thanks yanny lien um I i was going to raise the akherol one as well that andrew raised so I won't raise the same question but um I just think from the point of um these reports they really ought to have been sort of kind of a a call out box that says you know there is a there are issues here um and identifying what some of the issues were I mean it took two days for um you know it was happened on a tuesday it wasn't until the friday that the boil water notice was issued um from the advice that we've received it it's doubtful that that was actually even required but that's that's by the buy it's the delay that's the issue you're doing a review of it we know that but you wouldn't know that from reading this document so I think the document itself does need to have this is under review and this is why so unfortunately this document was signed off weeks then it should be added to the report to the it should be added to the front of the report update the report update the report so that you get a paragraph and at the front just saying noted since the time this was submitted I mean I don't think a time frame that is required for operational purposes of an organization is a good reason not to call out what is a significant um let's say learning opportunity um yeah I'm just reflecting the level of concern that we as governors need to be able to see what questions we should be responding to or asking and andrew's rightly asked that in relation to what happens next because there is a community that want to know the answers as much as every one of us does as well yeah the second question was in relation to um to nitrate so I mean we raised that at the select committee but I'm not seeing what I mean because 11.3 is the acute level um and I have to say that when we had uh some understood the difference between acute and in the longer term potential impacts of a lower number what is the lower number and are you seeing anything of concern and the nitrate sampling results that you've presented today so we have no idea what that lower number should be the danish reports we're talking about one um and the ministry of health did commission some work to look at that and to consider the evidence and what it means in the new zealand context but I haven't seen the outcome of that work so we've got averages over one month are you looking at in summer oh sorry yeah and pay page 63. yeah I was trying to understand that graph as well yep it's a table so it's not a graph so yeah yeah but it it looks as if um I mean it looks as if we're under the you know on average we're under the the the that level um that was identified in one study so you're quite right to say that but overall you're saying that that you would you would call out there's really only only one isn't there that's over just over but then it should be it's a lot of averages and so well it's enough for us to continue monitoring the trends and environment canterbury of course are also monitoring those trends yeah and I would expect that the new um requirements under the water services bill for a source water management plan that will be a big focus for christchurch city will be those levels of nitrate over time I think the the select committee did understand the significance of the source water protection issue yeah yes they did yep um and they linked it to the national policy national environmental standard for source water which is under review as well yeah thank you and so just um additional to that um it's a rolling five-year program of testing yes so can you explain what that means so it means that we can get around every well every every single water supply well every five years yeah and then so your next round is june've got a rolling program so we're undertaking the sampling every year particular dental part of reservoir those whatever you mentioned just bypass but these the problems still need to be the fix so I just want to know when the roof of this reservoir will be replaced and accept this roof need to be fixed have any other the potential problem need to be further the repair I just want to know why is the time frame so whether we have funding or not yeah so in the in the west zone so denton and sockburn have got those big round reservoirs with the multi-jointed roofs and it's those jointed roofs that they failed in the earthquakes catastrophically so the whole whole sections fell down and then there was a big repair program from skirt yes which resealed all of those joints and then about three years ago there was another repair program to improve the sealing of those joints and what we what we've now decided is that just patching those joints isn't good enough we still get small movements and you get small from the rain from from following that approach so um so what we're doing is the the reservoirs themselves are structurally sound yes so what we're doing is putting a membrane across the whole roof so there's a membrane that will cover the whole roof yes and we won't have that problem with the joints anymore and then they'll they'll make sure that that is also secure under the room and then down the side of those so that if there are any problems on the sides because the sides are similarly jointed but of course less water gets at them those will be resolved as well so that work should be finished where are we april that should be finished by the end of this month and then we'll move on to sock burn okay okay thank you that's good second one is the particular by nui those the edelberg adequacy report has been you know a month you know but here the european mentioned star wars review those the report the update all the original water the safety plan I they are not approved by those independent drinking water assistance whether some other the project popular still the same situation so the um so the adequacy reports what what the adequacy reports do is essentially give us a review of our water safety plans against the framework for water safety plans and tell us whether or not we've met the mark yes they are um they are extraordinarily detailed and at a level that we haven't encountered in the past with the um with the the old way of doing it with the local drinking water assessor so the um it's mostly around the level of documentation and procedures and monitoring that the weather requirements have increased significantly okay but this the funding weather will affect us all the right christchurch little river or the little kiddos the older plane or not just total separate so um so there what what the drinking water assessors have said to us is that the requirements of the water safety plans um depend on the nature of the water supply and mostly that's about the population served so clearly the risk and the consequences of something going wrong are catastrophic so a large number of people will be affected whereas with a very small drinking water supply so there are only 20 people affected and then it's much less and so the um the requirements in terms of the systems and procedures are much less uh although if we talk to some of our colleagues and other units of local government they're saying that even for the small water supplies the um it's a big ask for these water safety plans okay thank you thanks jimmy phil thanks helen um just a couple of questions okay bay what it says that it's going to the cost estimate could be a bit higher how much roughly higher I don't know until they've done the the detailed design okay but it'll be more than the 2.6 it may or may not be there they're thinking that it will be yes okay um excuse me is um so we've in no canes bay have we got a system there where everyone's got thing is it sort of like a mini city I'm not sure if everybody's connected to that so generally there's a reservoir then there's treatment things okay that's fine now do the other bays like little acalara and um pigeon bay do they have their own little systems as well some of them have private systems and some of them have um just household rainwater tanks right yeah okay but but they do also have treatment things by us but it's only so it's only ocane's bay yeah so a lot of the smaller bays do not have a um council right now and are we still trucking water from acura to devotionals because devotionals struggle for water are they are they worse off we are at the moment yes yeah but does that happen quite a lot is there a supply thing not that good they are very small streams and if you have a dry summer yeah we um we can only take a certain amount from our consent and then we must leave water in the stream for um very small stream okay and I i had a good yarn to aaron about using that tank for raw water that's sensible very good idea um and is it am I led to believe that the city council is now looking after the um water treatment thing at acara rather than city care uh no we work in partnership with city care so um citycare are running that water treatment plant but we um well I mean we always work closely with them okay that's right because that's they have um so what so the city council has the water safety plan which defines mostly how that how that plant is managed and citycare have their contractors plan which must respond to the water safety plan to ensure that all of those things are covered off and then we work with them in terms of the running of that plant so if there are any issues you know they'll give us a call okay that's right and lastly um I see we're going to go to sockburn to put a I'll shoe a if we had spent the money on the denton park membrane would it have saved us having that trouble at christmas time and having to do all this bypass work yes okay thank you hmm I'm ian thank you um just with denton um so at the moment it's chlorinated isn't it yes yes so any idea when that might come out or that depends on the water safety plan so the sign off for the water safety plan and the completion of the backflow work and the reservoir work there so timeline you're not quite sure again it's if everything is signed off as proposed it would be this year great okay thank you um the the section that you have on laboratory and the testing is so there's nitrate tested there nitrate levels tested do we do in our lab yes I think we do okay um at the zone committee last night they were talking about residents being able to test their wells for nitrates and I'm wondering is there any need for any of our christchurch residents to be information to residents and anybody who has private wells and where they can get it tested and certainly we can offer that service through our laboratory and there are also commercial laboratories that offer those services right and the best way to for people to access that service would be how uh if they call the council they can put them they'll put them through the lab right that's fantastic thank you and also um just at our there's so much going on in terms of um storm water and you know retention basins and things would it be possible for um if there was a I think there is interest and from residents to understand what's going on out there would it be possible for a staff person to come and talk to a residence association great always delighted to go to excellent residence association and um and showcase the work that's been done yeah so the upper history there's an enormous amount of work being done up there with stormwater and of course there are associated ecological benefits uh dog walking landscape thank you I'll continue the conversation thanks thanks mel um this is just back to the nitrates um one was would it be possible um in future reports to actually see the trends over time because these are averaged over quite a number of years which I understand but would that be possible for us to see I mean it's also difficult just to see like the different colors on the maps yeah like I can't tell the difference between two and 5.65 um and the average results that we've already commented on are relatively low but some of the maximum results are over that danish study result so it would be I would find it interesting just to see like all the data points if we can like you know you know like how often we go over you know it's a it's a mix of our monitoring data environment canterbury's monitoring data rather than just our own yeah but yes so one of the things that we will be required to do as part of the source water protection plan is suspect we'll be doing more monitoring for nitrate in the future yeah so just seeing a spread of the data and some plot would be quite nice would would you like I'm not sure that all of councillors want to see all of those data sets but would you like to have to have a session with one of the staff yeah yeah okay I'd like to be there too you'd like to be there as well okay so how many would like a session on the nitrates okay so we'll put together a small workshop shall we yep okay thank you because the other question is I mean we look at the average and you know the maximum is is the maximum so when you have a high reading that's just not acceptable and even when you get a maximum of 11.3 which is through the roof as far as I'm concerned you know there's going to be readings much higher than that as well talk to kevin brown he tests his own well he gets readings higher than that he of those shallow wells do have very high nitrates yeah that's correct quite a concern okay um yani it's um just just a little bit off the nitro topic but on page 83 you've got a nice um diet landscape plan for the avon river stock bank and this is the um waitaki street haven flood management it talks about being aligned with new brighton road pages road project um and cycle pedestrian paths but like I'm just um concerned that they're consenting before june 2021 um we haven't even discussed the page's word bridge like I certainly haven't seen what the plans are or new brighton road and certainly I know the mcr that I mean that's not even been approved the route selection so can you just help me understand how that is being aligned um I'll need to come back to you on that uh but the as I understand it the project managers from our side and from transport have been talking and making sure that those works are aligned I mean we've heard this there was no alignment we're now going back to parts of our area that we've done work in to look at cycle routes so it just seems to me we should be trying to take one approach and do it properly approach than kind of so we just so the waitaki works are being done because the temporary stock banks are in poor condition along there yeah and rather than repair those temporary stock banks and then build these we prefer to to bring them forward that part of the build yeah so we're not we're not planning to wait for the cycleways work but but if we at least had approval of you know the realignment of new brighton road and pages road bridge of where the cycleway was going then at least you would know but at the moment we haven't_''_4331.84 I mean maybe others have but I certainly have only seen very very high level concepts for the cycle route selection and you guys have seen that that high level root selection presentation yeah but you've seen the mco one everyone you agree to where it's going or have some incorporation like you know again I'll give you the hescat river the kiwi rail bridge where I mean we can't talk about it because it's not able to be talked about publicly but I can send it round to you guys where the actual route selection has an area where we've done zillions of dollars of work and we didn't incorporate something so helen um you can hear yanI's question can you please organise a memo that gives us assurance that this has all been treated together for efficiency we just need to know what the decision-making is so helen I've got a question on page 55 with the water safety plan and the christchurch little one we've got four unacceptable risks and number four the civil emergency earthquake or other large-scale disruption and our responses we're not going to do we can't_''_4453.679 do any improvement on that um so longer term action plans are being developed so I mean what do we do about that if there's no because of that can you explain that no so um so plans are approved so having an unacceptable risk in the plan doesn't mean that you don't get that plan approved really okay that's correct so but but what what in terms of a major earthquake in christchurch that is regarded as an unacceptable risk because we would have major disruption and the potential for contamination of the supply as we did after the earthquakes here there is there is um we don't we don't have sufficient money to build the resilience and the infrastructure to withstand an event like that and nor would it be a good expenditure of money um yeah to to do so uh so what we do have in place are the response plans but even the response plans that we have in place will take time to um to reinstate the supply to parts of the city uh depending on you know how much disruption there is so that that does remain an unacceptable risk in terms of the consequences for the people of the city however it's we can and then we we live with it if you like right well that's interesting that it's it it doesn't stop us getting the plan approved no no it doesn't stop there's nothing we can do to sort of prevent the the earthquake yeah so it's our response to it that's our response to it yes okay um and then um in the in the by-law review you've got there's implications on um tiwara and it's catchment can you explain that it's on page 52 uh no I can't I'd have to get one of the team to come back to you sorry okay I haven't got I haven't_''_4562.88 got that level of justice would be fine that's good okay thanks um and what about these um you mentioned the wet wipes in there too um are they still a problem are people still flushing those they are indeed there's been no reduction in that uh well there's been very little change so here in christchurch we don't have as people are still flushing all sorts of things down the sewer system that they should not and wet wipes are the worst that's a shame isn't it because it costs us a lot of money um and the other thing is just with our um other fifty percent of our tranche one funding what's timeline to receive that you might have said earlier I can't remember oh we receive it as we spend it so um we've got the 20 million up front and as we spend that and then deliver on the projects they and we report up to the department of internal affairs they pay us back right and we have to have the whole thing done by march 2022 that's correct 40 million spent or at least tagged spent right and we're not on track for that yes we are and what about tranche 2 um I've heard of whisper that that funding might not be as real as it was going to be I haven't heard any whispers about tranche too so that's fine I'm have to charge too and it may it may have the central government's thinking may have evolved right and you have to stay in to get that anyway yeah that was the original proposal yes that tranche term was available when people um opted in as it were great all right any other questions on helen's report aaron yeah um a couple uh just then when you're saying trench too though helen uh phil's ears are still ringing from the weekend and he thought you were saying um trench too and he was going to come up with another one to help you yeah but anyway that aside um on the wet wipes have we looked at potentially doing a um a campaign with the supermarkets and that where we clearly either put a sticker on the packets or we put some signage up where they sell them telling people not to put them down the toilet well people don't people don't read the packets that's why we do boil water notices because on every every container of baby formula it says to don't they just take it out the tap and shake it up and give it to the baby but says it on the tin so what have we done in the in the past have we run campaigns on like we haven't run any commentators but they're actually spend the rest of the tables wheels we'll just leave it and just keep doing it the way we're doing it because that's not working it's really hard one changing behaviour too yeah you know they're just being wet wipes I'd say there is another thing where people just don't know I mean there's and just because it's written on the back of a packet in small print that you shouldn't put it down the toilet doesn't mean people don't like they have a competition out of bromley what's the weirdest thing that turns up every year that's made it through the pipes okay we should get the pictures thanks erin is that your final question no not okay yeah um so the other one 126 signed off and then you've got the other workers underway of the further three planning design for the other 12 is underway is that all of them at that point so there's only 12 left yes oh yeah and what's the completion date for the work on those well some of those may in fact be abandoned and will um bore you new worlds so then there'll still be more wealth to do it's the most difficult ones that are left now right and um yeah a number of those are likely to be abandoned but then we do other ones we do other wells yes right so we've got a new world drilling program underway so how many wells are in that uh at the moment I think we've got five that are underway and then once those five are finished that's all our world's done we've got a rolling program of new worlds so as the city grows and we require more water and more water in different places so there'll always be more wells there ones a year do we roll out but once all the other ones are done there'll be two three usually one to three a year I think what's the cost of drilling a well obviously varies how do it varies around a million to drill and develop a well so do dc's cover that um to it for um for brand new development but at the moment most of it is um is sort of retrospective so the bexley pump station for example has got a new wheel field uh sorry the benry one which is replacing bexley has got a new well field um we're we've drilled new wells at maize we're drilling new wells at redwood so they are to replace older wells and existing areas so that that number of the um the million dollars does that include all the hardware yes so that's everything all the gear this goes with it just turn it on at the end you've got water cool well well thanks helen that's been a really interesting discussion this morning at least I we've got those actions to come back I'll go over those with you that's all the questions for today all right well class james an update from the question um that was asked before um thanks david for organizing to send through this information the current terms of reference for the zone committees include a provision that the committee does not have the authority to submit on proposed resource management or local government plans well I think there's a review still underway it's worth ecan at the moment I think we finished the reviews um well I've got a um I know it's ridiculous have you got any other suggestions um well let's let's talk to ecan and maybe informally at this stage at this point anyway I mean it's a low risk sort of issue maybe informally we can get ecan and the council to agree that the zone committees can make submissions to both ltps because remember there's ecan yes as well doing its ltp because they're joint committees ask the chairs if they wanted to them as individuals you know or as part of the group that they belong to that is not the zone committee and then um reference all the work that the zone committee has done on the subject I mean just just to get something on paper and then time yeah yeah and in the meantime before the next annual plan kind of thing maybe liam you could write to jenny and say sure this is something we could change yeah or or even the collection of chairs could meet as a group and say we're we're sending this and not as our zone committees but as a representative the chairs of the zombies that need funding and stuff I think it would have to come from the committee itself wouldn't it to hold any real weight because then they get started on there it's just it's just a holding yeah so that they can get a submission in front of us so would would you be happy to follow that up with jenny huey lien um on getting he wants to take a note should surely staff should be able to deal with this and get something that will enable you to do something I just let's just do it and apologize later if there's any issues so are you volunteering yes oh thank you um okay I need to move it for this report anyway so that was good to have that little deferral so jake and seconded um sarah I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right well I suppose no I consider that carried james you
Propose it's kerry okay welcome helen move on to your um three waters by monthly report item eight and you want to introduce it with a brief summary please uh yes just to note a couple of things so first of all that uh water reform has been continuing with some pace and I know that both elected members and staff have been engaging with various workshops around the country so there's work going on in the governance space and the design of any proposed new entities there's work going on in the regulatory space with the um the new rules and standards so that's the new maximum acceptable values and of course the um the water services bill is on its way through select committee and this council went up and made a submission on that also just to note that the stimulus fund program is continuing and we've made good progress in terms of the wastewater mains those builds are you know mostly underway the water supply mains where all of the detailed design work has been completed and construction will begin in process that's been put out by department of internal affairs as well so one of the major projects that we'd put up we now want to delay so that we align with some roading works and that there's a change process where we can substitute some other work and you won't be surprised to hear that we are proposing to put up a couple of reservoirs to accelerate the reservoir program in terms of helen was that all in that tranche one funding you're talking about yes all on the trench one funding yeah so that's in the 40 million that's come across and that's to be delivered by march 2022 in terms of the um the water services bill the the council submission focused on a risk-based approach compared to the mandatory residual disinfection which means chlorine also talked about the importance of source protection and the fact that our very high quality groundwater means that mandatory physical treatment is not necessary here in christchurch either so there were some key points in the um in the bill that were just submission and there were some good questions as a result of those submissions as well so I thought it was a very good process and there's a large number of councils submitting and it's some themes emerging that I think we might see some change in the bill and I think that's particularly around the the small supplies so the um the number of councils who are concerned about responsibility for small suppliers coming onto the territorial authorities is is huge and the number of those small suppliers has exceeded anyone's expectations so they started out thinking there were five thousand of them their next estimate was around twenty to thirty thousand and now they think there might be more than seventy thousand of them around the country so it is that's a it's a big ask uh the other thing to note I think is um just incidents in terms of resource consent and we did have an incident in saint albans creek where sediment laden water was released from a construction site that was reported to environment canterbury we haven't had and instructed our contractor to um to comply with those consent conditions so the the the responsibility of counsel and the responsibilities of contractors is sometimes not so clear with consent compliance and so we've been doing some training as well for our project managers to make sure that they are they are upskilled and they're more proactive in the space the water safety plans in terms of progress the christchurch water safety plan as you know was submitted just before christmas and the drinking water assessors from why comply have been going through the process of reviewing that and we've got two workshops set up in april with staff to explore any issues um and any questions that they have so that that is still a work in progress we don't we don't actually have a timeline for when they'll when they'll sign that off there is a statutory timeline but I don't think that will apply at all in terms of transgressions there were no transgressions and for drinking water quality in the last couple of months but of course animals being discovered in that reservoir so that that happened early in february and we put the boil water notice on and then the tankers were in akara the next day and work commenced to put a temporary reservoir tank farm in place so the um the tank farm was commissioned middle of march and then 18th of march that boil water notice was lifted and now of course we're looking at a um a permanent reservoir replacement there we are likely once we've um drained and had a look at that old reservoir we're likely to put it back in service but as a raw water reservoir so we'll use it to to balance takes from the streams and have raw water and then from there it'll go into the treatment plant and have two new treated water reservoirs at the other end of that treatment plant so that's that work is underway uh just uh as you mentioned plan change seven in terms of the land water regional plan we have stepped up our nitrate monitoring across the district and you'll in our aquifers these the nitrate levels are nowhere near the maximum acceptable value however we do want to monitor these and keep an eye on them and we are aware that there may be changes to that maximum acceptable value so at the moment it's a chronic exposure limit that protects babies uh however the recent research may mean that a um sorry at the moment it's an acute one it may be a chronic one that comes in for that research and the association with with colorectal cancer so we'll keep we'll keep an eye on that and we'll report back to you on the next round for that in terms of water supply operations water demand is tracking at about its usual level we have had um high demand over the summer and we have had water restrictions in place um particularly over on banks peninsula so some banks peninsula settlements are still at level four so that's complete hosing ban and that is because of the the very dry summer we've had and indeed an extraordinarily dry march so anytime soon we do need some significant rain over there before we can do that just a note that the temporary chlorine equipment continues to to work well and the uv at main pump is working outstandingly well so we're very pleased with that with that installation uh we've got a note in there about response times for water service requests so those um we'll keep those up to date so that you can monitor the trends there but we have now seen a um a sustained improvement in those response times so responding to um to both urgent and non-urgent water leaks and repairs and outages so that is good to see one of the other things you'll notice is we've put in some um operational graphs of the monitoring that we do at our major treatment plant out at bromley and we'll we'll we'll play around with what information we're giving you here but what we're wanting to do is is give you some um some better oversight really of how the operation of that plant is going compliance for that discharge so there's some information there and we're happy to take any feedback on that and what's useful and what's not and we'll try and turn it into something that's perhaps more visually pleasing and easier to read than these that drop out of the instrumentation but we've got some it's got some graphs in there just the major things that we monitor being the biological oxygen demand um suspended solids e coli and total coliforms from that plant so everything is is running well but it's um I think it's good for you to see how well rather than just take our assurances that that's in place another thing to note in terms of wastewater management is that we have just completed um a modelling exercise of our wet weather overflow flow compliance and the reason we do that by modelling is that the wet weather is not predictable year on year so our system has to comply with a um with a modeled frequency of overflows and that can be of course calibrated by indicating that we've got um we've got a few issues in some parts of the city and that is going to inform the um the capital program so we'll target those catchments where we've got moreover we're predicting more overflows wet weather overflows then then the consent allows and we'll do those we'll do those works and there are also some operational changes that we've made to ensure that we remain within compliance I think the only other thing I would draw your attention to would be the capital program um which is largely continuing um as predicted there are there are a few projects that have been deferred and some other projects that have been brought forward for various reasons and some of them are around availability of parts from overseas so we've still got some issues in terms of covert in the lockdown and some parts that are taking a little time to come through mostly affecting littleton wastewater I'm happy to take questions oh it's a very comprehensive report helen thank you very much right we've got um three questions on three different matters um so the akaroa reservoir issue um thanks for the update and thanks also for coming out to akuro and fronting that rather heated community meeting your comments went down very well so thanks to you and staff for doing that one of the a lot of the questions the community asked at that meeting we responded by saying there's an enquiry there's an inquiry underway um and once we've got a report back from that inquiry we'll be able to provide further information are you able to update on the status of the inquiry and how we intend to feed back to the community yes so um our own internal risk and audit group so sean daos has conducted a review of the incident and the response and his final report has just been lodged with dawn this week so we'll be able to report to you we can do it by memo if you like rather than wait till the next twee meeting so that report once it's gone through dawn is that it probably could or at least the conclusions and recommendations could there are some there are some sort of staff disciplinary matters involved which we would prefer to keep confident confidential that's fine um there are also some recommendations about processes uh to to improve which which yeah I find to be shared yeah and then will you be turning your mind to how we communicate that back to the community yes we will thank you um second matter page 66 um the okanese bay water supply clearly investigations have led to a thought that there may need to be further um and may need to be more budget for this um looking at the timing in the last annual plan we deferred this to financial year 22. is there anything that we need to consider as part of the current ltp finalization or would any changes be able to be taken to into account with the next annual plan I would prefer the letter so at the moment yes there are some changes to the design of the treatment plant given the the analytical work that's been quality from those streams so once we have those changes we'll know what the budget implications are and yes they can be accommodated through the annual plan so that would be a staff bid or a staff suggestion for the um 2022 annual plan yes if we exceed the budget that's available in the long term plan okay thank you and then um final question the water supply reticulation renewals program we had received briefings in the past and some matters have been highlighted relating to lead jointed pipes particularly in the older suburbs of the city to what extent is this program prioritizing that work on renewal of those lead jointed pipes so the um the caster and lead jointed pipes are a very small proportion of our total reticulation so they're less than five percent of the total articulation and only a very small proportion of that causes us problems so it's only where those lead jointed mains are have a dead end and the water sits in the main and then can accumulate levels of lead that are of concern so we we the whole program what we've done is we've targeted those dead-end mains and there are nine of them which are currently scoped I think there's two that have been completed and a couple of others are underway so we're replacing those dead end mains I think that's a matter of priority given that that had been raised as a matter of priority in previous reports it might be good for there to be closing the loop so that we can see when that works done I'll just be getting an update on that particular part of the program so um so what we're doing is we're continuing the monitoring program across the city to identify where we've got those where we've got the lead jointed mains where we've got the dead ends and where that does result in an increase in lead in the water and that's a smaller proportion again so even having a lead jointed main and a dead end doesn't mean that you've got concerning levels of lead but in some places they in one sample in that 24 hour sequence that we talked about last time but what we're going to do is we'll put together a report on both the monitoring program the extent of those mains and the program for replacement and we'll bring that to you so you've got the whole thing in one report excellent thank you so when will that be helen would it be the next three three yeah we can bring that to the next toy meeting or again we can bring it by memo if you like so that reports in draft at the moment mimo is probably okay I think all right thank you we'll also update the website because we do have those um those lead mains mapped on the website so we can put an update on the website so it's available for the public good thank you so yani and then I think leanne you have one too and then jimmy oh thank you um just just getting back to the issue of the water safety plan and when we can remove the temporary in one of the sections of the report it talks about that all of our wells have basically been um so sorry this is page 57 so if 126 wells have been signed up as secure by the expert in wellhead security uv treatment has been installed this is blah blah blah sufficient to supply christchurch from harbour brooklyn's kanga and wai nui almost entirely from water from sakura wells so just trying to get my head around it so basically the thing that we said we would do to take temporary clawing out under the old water safety plan we've done everything it's the new things that they've added since um with the new water safety plan that we've submitted that includes backplot backflow prevention is is that basically correct so yes so there's there's three things that are driving the use of chlorine in the network one is where we have a well head that that well almost all of our well head's now been upgraded as as you know right but not all of them were signed off by signed off by the drinking water assessor there is no chlorine and that includes as you noted brooklyn's kayanga and some parts of parklands in the northwest and large parts of the rafferty zone so there's no chlorine there it's got those wellheads been upgraded and they've been signed off by the drinking water assessor and there are no issues with the backflow or the reservoirs which we'll come to where the wellheads have been upgraded but not signed off by the drinking water assessor the chlorine has been reduced from either one part per million or 0.5 per million whatever the dose was at that pump station down to 0.2 parts per million so it's been reduced but not removed because we haven't got the sign off from the drinking water assessor sorry just to be clear we've got the sign off from an expert so from an expert in wellhead assessment effectively under the old water safety plan that we had that was current before we submitted the new one that would have been adequate to stop chlorination no under process we did with the drinking water assessor that's right and that that was that was progressing through the wellheads and then at a certain point the drinking water assessors stopped signing those off right and have we had any conversations about um whether we could sign off those from the drinking water assessor given that it's like exactly the same risk except as the only water assessor will not sign off those well kids so now the the risk is now to be managed through the new water safety plan and as you noted in the new water safety plan there is um we we continue to have residual chlorine present where we have um not fully resolved the backflow production so all I was trying to understand like we've got current infrastructure that we've had signed off by the experts that the drinking water assessor approved and said that's okay yes I think we've just said is that in those zones the backflow wasn't an issue we've done all the work around backflips at the backflow and the stuff that the same as the ones that have already been signed off because of the backflow that's correct so essential that basically the main zone where we're working on the backflow that we can't get we're we're working on the central zone um and also the um the west zone and uh some of rickettson and also our fairy midway so are there any of those zones that we'll get the backflow stuff done within a time frame where we might be ahead of the others and we could ask for them to be the chlorine to be lifted we could ask but I doubt that we would get them because we we have agreed with the ministry of health that the um that the risk will be managed through the new water safety plan and through the sign off of the new water safety plan it's the new water safety plan that identifies the backflow issue and the reservoir issue and it's the new water safety plan that we're waiting on approval for but if it's such a risk um've upgraded the wellheads then why don't they force us to chlorinate temporary chlorinate in the other areas that we don't currently have it because we've resolved the backflow in those other zones so when we resolve the backflow in the new zones why wouldn't they sign it off so it's we're going on a bit of a circular argument so we're sort of we're operating under we're operating under two water safety plans if you like we're operating under our approved water safety plan for the wellheads and we're operating under our proposed water safety plan for the back flow and the reservoirs so okay but just in terms of the backflow so when's the time frame we're expected to get that work complete for the whole city well we're doing it zone by zone and most of the work should be completed by the end of june uh in those zones there may be some outstanding ones where they're technically difficult um but certainly by the end of the year all of the then there's the age testing of the water which is the other issue is that being sorted now the age testing of the water is still underway yes it's into 2021 yep and the modelling that's associated with it so there's basically no chance of getting chlorination out in the meantime so it's already out in some parts of the city well under the old plan under the old plan yes and we're where we resolve um backflow and reservoirs it's backed off to the point two and if the well heads have got the double sign off it comes out there as well so oh sorry all I'm trying to understand like if we get the certain zones backflow done rather than wait for the groundwater testing and and the other zones to be complete is there any opportunity to stop the temperate chlorination in certain zones if we get all the work done if we've got double sign-off on the wells yes yeah if we haven't got double sign-off on the wells then it's no and has give double sign-off until we get the water safety plan approved that's correct and so when are we looking to get the little safety plan approached that is a very good question so we'll have the workshops in april and after the workshops in april we'll have a much better idea of where the questions are from the drinking water assessors great yeah it just seems like we're going around the circles it is a very difficult process I mean I understand there are now three approved in the country and given that there are hundreds of water supplies operated by councils that's a very small number so yes it is a very difficult process to get a water safety plan approved okay so would you keep us updated and just dent it just two other questions one is um the water supply or the water integrated water strategy that's not picked up in this report the integrated water strategy no I haven't_''_1351.36 said anything about the integrated water strategy in this report so we've got an outstanding resolution on the rain yes you've got an outstanding resolution about rainwater um rainwater tanks and greywater tanks yeah yes there's a memo being drafted um by our friends and policy and we're waiting for some input from the planning people and from the operational people about that and then we'll bring that to you right and will we have a chance to discuss options for for looking at that and what we can do like district planning or certainly okay that would be very cool um any other question was we did raise questions about denton as well is there a audit of denton or what happened there or there will be yes there'll be an incident report for denton so denton's operating in bypass at the moment and we're doing the repair work on that reservoir right okay cool so with the rain rain water and great water tanks um fit in with the bylaw work at all it should do yeah um so if it does we need to try and we need to get the options back on what we can do yeah guess my concern is that if we don't get the information ahead of the ltp that if we want to do stuff we won't have budget for it so yeah yeah that's why I'm getting it yep yep thanks yani leanne I was going to raise the akherol one as well that andrew ray so I won't raise the same question but um I just think from the point of um these reports they're really ought to have been sort of kind of a a call out box that says you know there is a there are issues here um and identifying what some of the issues were I mean it took two days for um you know it was happened on a tuesday it wasn't until the friday that the boil water notice was issued from the advice that we've received it it's doubtful that that was actually even required but that's that's by the by it's the delay that's the issue you're doing a review of it we know that but you wouldn't document itself does need to have this is under review and this is why so unfortunately this document was signed off weeks ago um so it was it was before the review then it should be added to the report to the it should be added to the front of the report update the report update the report so that you get a paragraph and at the front just saying noted since the time this was submitted I mean I don't think a time frame that is required for operational purposes of an organisation is a good reason not to call out what is a significant um let's say learning opportunity um yeah I'm just reflecting the level of concern that we as governors need to be able to see what questions we should be responding to or asking and andrew's rightly asked that in relation to what happens next because there is a community that wants to know the answers as much as every one of us does as well the second question was in relation to um to uh um nitrate so I mean not seeing what I mean because 11.3 is the acute level and I have to say that when we had some advice provided to us that was the first time I understood the difference between acute and in the longer term potential impacts of a lower number what is the lower number and are you seeing anything of concern and the nitrate sampling results that you've presented today so we have no idea what that lower number should be the the danish reports we're talking about one and the ministry of health did commission some work to look at that and to consider the evidence and what it means in the new zealand context but I haven't seen the outcome of that work so we've got averages over one are you looking at in summary oh sorry yes yeah and pay page 63. yeah I was trying to understand that graph as well yep it's a table so it's not a graph so yeah but it it looks as if um I mean it looks as if we're under the you know on that was identified in one study so you're quite right to say that but overall you're saying that you looking at those overall results there's nothing that you would you would call out there's really only only one isn't there that's over just over but then should be it's enough for averages well it's enough for us to continue monitoring the trends and environment canterbury of course are also monitoring those trends and I would expect that the new requirements under the water services bill for a source water management plan that will be a big focus for christchurch city will be those levels of nitrate um over time I think the the select committee did understand the significance of the source water protection issue yeah yes they did yeah and they linked it to the national policy the national environmental standard for source water which is under review as well yeah thank you and so just um additional to that it's a rolling five-year program of testing yes so can you explain what that means so it means that we well every five years yeah and then so your next round is june this year yes we've got a roll so we've got a rolling program so we're undertaking the sampling every year that's right okay that's good thank you first one I followed the yani the question particularly denton part is whispering those whatever you mentioned just bypass but this is the problems still need to be the fix so I just want to know when the roof of this reservoir will be replaced and accept this roof need to be fixed have any other the potential problem need to be further the repair I just want to know why is the time frame so whether we have funding or not yeah so in the in the west zone so denton and sockburn have got those big round reservoirs with the multi-jointed roofs and it's those jointed roofs that um they failed in the earthquakes catastrophically so the whole whole sections fell down and then they there was a big repair program from skirt yes which resealed all of those joints and then improve the sealing of those joints and what we what we've now decided is that just patching those joints isn't good enough we still get small movements and you get small amounts of water um being washed and contaminants being washed in from the rain from from following that approach so um so what we're doing is the the reservoirs themselves are structurally sound yes so what we're doing is putting a membrane across the whole roof so there's a membrane that will cover the whole roof yes and we won't have that problem with the joints anymore and then they'll um they'll make sure that that is also secure under the room and then down the side of those so that if there are any problems on the sides because the sides are similarly jointed but of course less water gets at them those will be resolved as well so that work should be finished where are we april that should be finished by the end of this month and then we'll move on to sock burn okay okay thank those the edible adequacy report has been you know a month you know but here the europa mentioned star wars review those the report the update all the original water the safety plan I just want to know what kind of items you know they are not approved by those independent drinking water assistance whether some other the project probably the still the same situation so the um so the adequacy reports what what the adequate sweet reports do is essentially give us a review of our water safety plans against the framework for water safety plans and tell us whether or not we've met the mark they are they are extraordinarily detailed and at a level that we haven't encountered in the past with the um with the the old way of doing it with the local drinking water assessor so the um it's mostly around the level of documentation and procedures and monitoring that the weather requirements have increased significantly okay but this the funding weather will affect us all the right chryslers little river or the little condos the older plane or not just assessors have said to us is that the requirements of the water safety plans um depend on the nature of the water supply and mostly that's about the population served so clearly if you've got a very large city like christchurch the risk and the consequences of something going wrong are catastrophic so a large number of people will be affected whereas with a very small drinking water supply say there are only 20 people affected then it's much less and so the um the requirements in terms of the systems and procedures are much less uh although if we talk to some of our colleagues and other units of local government they're saying that even for the small water supplies the um it's a big ask for these water safety plans okay thank you thanks jimmy phil thanks helen um just a couple of questions okay names bay what it says that it's going to the cost estimate could be a bit higher how much roughly higher I don't know until they've done the the detailed design okay but it'll be that they're thinking that it will be yes okay excuse me is um so we've in no canes bay have we got a system there where everyone's got water obviously and fire hydrants and all that sort of thing is it's sort of like a mini city I'm not sure if everybody's connected to that so generally there's a reservoir and there's treatment things okay that's fine now do the other bays like little acolyra and um pigeon bay do they have their own little systems as well some of them have private systems and some of them have um just household rainwater tanks right yeah okay but but they do also have treatment things by us but it's okay so it's only okay yeah so a lot of the smaller bays do not have a um council right fair enough and are we still trucking water from acura to devotionals because devotionals struggle for water are they are they worse off we are at the moment yes yeah but does that happen quite a lot is there streams and if you have a dry summer yeah we um we can only take a certain amount from our consent and then we must leave water in the stream for um you know environmental reasons okay so yes that's a very small stream okay and I i had a good yarn to aaron about using that tank for raw water that's sensible very good idea and is it am I led to believe that the city council is now looking after the water treatment thing at acara rather than city here no we work in partnership with citicare so um citicare are running that water treatment plant but we um well I mean we always work closely with them okay because that's they they have um so what so the city council has the water safety plan which defines mostly how that how that plant is managed and citicare have their contractors plan which must respond to the water safety plan to ensure that all of those things are covered off and then we work with them in terms of the running of that plant so us a call okay that's right and lastly um I i see we're going to go to sockburn to put a I'll show a butanol membrane over the membrane going on at southbound yes if we had spent the money on the denton park membrane would it have saved us having that trouble at christmas time and having to do all this bypass work yes okay thank you hmm um just with denton um so at the moment it's chlorinated isn't it yes yes so any idea when that might come out or that depends on the water safety plan so the sign off for the water safety plan and the completion of the backflow work and the reservoir work there so timeline you're not quite sure again it's um if everything is signed off as proposed it would be this year great okay thank you um the the section that you have on laboratory and the testing is so there's nitrate tested there nitrate levels tested there do we do nitrate in our lab yes I think we do okay um uh residents being able to test their wells for nitrates and I'm wondering is there any need for any of our christchurch residents to be doing that at all so environment canterbury provide really good information to residents and anybody who has private wells and where they can get it tested and certainly we can offer that service through our laboratory and there are also commercial laboratories that offer those services right and the best way to for people to access that service would be how uh if they call the council they can put them they'll put them through the lab right that's fantastic thank you and also um just at our there's so much going on in terms of um stormwater and you know retention basins and things would it be possible for um if there was a I think there is interest and from residents to understand what's going on out there would it be possible for a staff person to come and talk to a residence association great always delighted excellent residents association and um and showcase the work that's amount of work being done up there with storm water and of course there are associated ecological benefits uh dog walking landscape all that yeah it's looking pretty good yeah great thank you I'll continue the conversation thanks thanks mel um this is just back to the nitrates um one was would it be possible um in future reports to actually see the trends over time because these are averaged over quite a number of years which I understand but would that be possible for us to see I mean it's also difficult just to see like the different colors on the maps yes yeah like I can't tell the difference between two and five point six five um and the average results that we've already commented on are relatively um low but some of the maximum results are over that danish study result so it would be I would find it interesting just to see like all the data points if we can like you know like how often we go over you know it's a it's a mix of our monitoring own yeah but yes so one of the things that we will be required to do as part of the source water protection plan is to put together a monitoring program for nitrates and I suspect we'll be doing more monitoring for nitrate in the future yeah so just seeing a spread of the data and some plot would be quite nice would would you like I'm not sure that all of councillors want to see all of those data sets but would you like to have to have a session with one of the staff yeah yeah okay I'd like to be there too you'd like to be there as well okay so how many would like a session on the nitrates okay so we'll put together a small workshop shall we yep okay thank you because the other question is I mean we look at the average and you know the maximum is is the maximum so when you have a high reading that's just not acceptable and even when you get a maximum of 11.3 which is through the roof as to be readings much higher than that as well talk to kevin brown he tests his own well he gets readings higher than that he's out at um out that way somewhere yes some of those shallow wells do have very high nitrates yeah that's correct quite a concern okay um yummy it's um just just a little bit off the nitro topic but on page 83 you've got a nice um diet landscape plan for the avon river stock bank and this is the um waitaki street haven flood management it talks about being aligned with new brighton road pages road project and cycle pedestrian paths but like I'm just um concerned that they're consenting before june 2021 we haven't even discussed the pages work bridge like I certainly haven't seen what the plans are or new brighton road and certainly I know the mcr that I mean that's not even been approved the root selection so can you just help me understand how that is being aligned um I'll need to come back to you on that uh our side and from transport have been talking and making sure that those works are aligned I mean we heard this with respect we heard this through the land dredging program there was no alignment we're now going back to parts of our area that we've done work in to look at cycle routes so it just seems to me we should be trying to take one approach and do it properly approach then so the waitaki works are being done because the temporary stock banks are in poor condition along there yeah and rather than repair those temporary stock banks and then build these um we prefer to to bring the forward that part of the build yeah so we're not we're not planning to wait for the cycleways work but but if we at least had approval of you know the realignment of new brighton road and pages road bridge and approval of where the cycleway was going then at least you would know but at the moment we haven't_''_2480.64 I mean maybe others have but I certainly have only seen very very you know do you name white no no no that's what I'm wondering no no you guys have seen that that high level root selection presentation yeah but you've seen the mcr one who's seen but if at least if you agree to where it's going or have some incorporation like you know again I'll give you the haircut river the kiwi rail bridge where I mean we can't talk about it because it's not able to be talked about publicly but I can send it around to you guys where the actual route selection has an area where we've done zillions of dollars of work and we didn't incorporate some things so helen um you can hear yanI's question can you please organise a memo that gives us assurance that this has all been treated together for efficiency we just need to know what the decision making is they'll always so helen I've got a question on page um 55 with the water safety plan and the christchurch little one we've got four unacceptable risks disruption and our responses we're not going to do we can't_''_2602.56 do any improvement on that so longer term action plans have been developed so I mean what do we do about that if there's no improvement to make will we not get the plan approved because of that can you explain that no so um so plans are approved so having an unacceptable risk in the plan doesn't mean that you don't get that plan approved really okay that's correct so but but what what in terms of a major earthquake in christchurch that is regarded as an unacceptable risk because we would have major disruption and the potential for contamination of the supply as we did after the earthquakes here there is there is um we don't we don't have sufficient money to build the resilience in the infrastructure to withstand an event like that and nor would it be a good expenditure of money um to to do so uh so what we do have in place are the response plans but even the response plans that we have supply two parts of the city uh depending on you know how much disruption there is so that that does remain an unacceptable risk in terms of the consequences for the people of the city however it's one it's one that we um we do what we can and then we we live with it if you like right well that's interesting that it's it it doesn't stop us getting the plan approved no no it doesn't stop so there's um there's nothing we can do to sort of prevent the the earthquake yeah so it's our response to it that's our response to it yes okay um and then um in the in the by-law review you've got there's implications on um tiwa and it's catchment can you explain this on page 52. uh no I can't I'd have to get one of the team to come back to you sorry okay I haven't got I haven't_''_2711.68 got that level of just a memo would be fine that's good okay thanks wipes in there too um are they still a problem are people still flushing those they are indeed there's been no reduction in that uh well there's been very little change so here in christchurch we don't have as many problems as as some other cities do but yes people are still flushing all sorts of things down the sewer system that they should not and wet wipes are the worst that's a shame isn't it because it costs us a lot of money um and the other thing is just with our um other fifty percent of our tranche one funding what's the timeline to receive that you might have said earlier I can't remember oh we receive it as we spend it so um we've got the 20 million up front and as we spend that and then deliver on the projects they and we report up to the department of internal affairs they pay us back right and we have to have the whole thing done by march 2022 that's correct 40 million spent or at least tagged yes we are and what about tranche2 um I've heard of whisper that that funding might not be as real as it was going to be I haven't heard any whispers about tranche too so that's fine I'm not I'm not sure what's happening and you have to charge too it may it may have the central government's thinking may have evolved right and you have to stay in to get that anyway yeah that was the original proposal yes that tranche term was available when people um opted in does it work right all right any other questions on helen's report aaron yeah um a couple uh just then when you're saying trench too though helen uh phil's ears are still ringing from the weekend and he thought you were saying um trench too and he was going to come up with another one to help yeah but anyway that aside um on the wet wipes have we looked at potentially doing a um a campaign with the supermarkets and that where we clearly either put a sticker on sell them telling people not to put them down the toilet well people don't people don't read the packets that's why we do boil water notices because on every every container of baby formula it says to boil the water before you make the formula most people don't they just take it out the tap and shake it up and give it to the baby but says it on the tin so what have we done in the past have we run campaigns on like we haven't run any communicators but there are competitors spend the rest of the tables wheels we'll just leave it and just keep doing it the way we're doing it because that's not working it's really hard one changing behavior too yeah you know they're just being the bit wipes I'd say there is another thing where people just don't know I mean there's and just because it's written on the back of a packet in small print that you shouldn't put it down the toilet doesn't mean people what's the the weirdest thing that turns up every year that's made it through the pipes okay we should get the pictures thanks erin is that your final question no not ok um so the other one uh is around the well heads where you've got the 126 signed off and then you've got the other workers underway of the further three planning design for the other 12 is underway is that all of them at that point yes there's only 12 left yes oh yeah and when what's the completion date for the work on those well some of those may in fact be abandoned and will um bore new new wills so there'll still be more wealth to do it's the most difficult ones that are left now right and um yeah a number of those are likely to be abandoned but then we do other ones we do other wells yes right so we've got a new world drilling program underway so how many wells are in that uh at the moment I think we've got five that's all our worlds done we've got a rolling program of new worlds so as the city grows and we require more water and more water in different places so there'll always be more wells there'll always be more wheels right so how many new ones a year do we roll out but once all the other ones are done there'll be two three usually what's the cost of drilling a well obviously varies how do it varies around a million to drill and develop a well so do dc's cover that but at the moment most of it is um is sort of retrospective so the bexley pump station for example has got a new wheel field uh sorry the benry one which is replacing bexley has got a new well field um we're we've drilled new wells at maize we're drilling new wells at redwood so they are to replace older wells and in existing reticulated areas so that that number of the um the million dollars does that include all the hardware yes so that's everything it on at the end you've got water cool well well thanks helen that's been a really interesting discussion this morning at least I think it has been really good report thank you and we've got those actions to come back I'll go over those with you forward that's all the questions for today all right well class james daniels because excuse me yes just an update from the question that was asked before thanks david for organising to send through this information the current terms of reference for the zone committees include a provision that the committee does not have the authority to submit on proposed resource management or local government plans well it I think there's a review still underway it's with ecan at the moment I think we've finished the reviews um well I got a um I know it's ridiculous have you got any other suggestions in um well let's let's talk to ecan and maybe informally at this stage at this point anyway I mean it's a low risk sort of issue maybe that the zone committees can make submissions to both ltps because remember there's ecan yes as well doing its ltp because they're joint committees the chairs if they wanted to to write um sort of right submissions but but submit them as individuals you know or as part of the group that they belong to that is not the zone committee and then um reference all the work that the zone committee has done on the subject I mean just just to get something on paper and in time yeah and in the meantime before the next annual plan kind of thing maybe liam you could write to jenny and say sure this is something we could change yeah or or even the collection of chairs could meet as a group and say we're we're sending this and not as our zone committees but as a representative the chairs of the zombies that need funding and stuff though I think it would have to come from the committee itself wouldn't it to hold any real weight yeah because then they get stuff from there it they can get a submission in front of us yes so would would you be happy to follow that up with jenny huey leanne um on getting he wants let's just do it and apologize later if there's any issues so are you volunteering yes I volunteer oh thank you um okay I need to move her for this report anyway so that was good we have that little deferral so jake and seconded um sarah and put
Petitions none so item seven is the minutes of the waimakariri zone committee so that's actually four sets of minutes for some reason they came through the september october november and march minutes and um the minutes from the other committees were not ready at the time of the report so they'll be coming probably next next month is that right david okay so we have a movie for those minutes oh okay siri have a question um within their minutes and things into account because they're not a formal submission and we asked last week to get some of the resolution on that so I just wondered if we could formally ask for advice from staff I'm happy to go away and um come back with some advice on that as quickly as because time obviously is marching on in terms of the itp process well it's just it's and it's also a follow-up from a discussion we had in the last meeting fair enough um the only thing is that our next meeting's not till july would have to come idea how long it might take by the end of the week oh easy okay yep thanks ian I mean do we need to build I think so too and look um he thinks sarah I think that's a good move and um on page 23 it talks about flood risk on the northern side of waimakariri I assume it's the northern side of waimakari I'm not sure but I'm just wondering that since that zone committee looks at flood risk I'm wondering why I don't recall christchurch west melton ever looking at flood risk and I know it's an ecan project the stock banks I'm just wondering james if you might take that back to the zone committee next meeting and just ask do they look at the flood risk in the stock banks for the waimakariri yeah that's great and I also note that on page 22 plan change seven hearings have concluded on the 26th of february and ecan are expected to make a decision in june or july 21 so that will be interesting okay so I jimmy put that motion on aaron question just around the um the stop banks didn't_''_216.72 we have a full presentation here around the stock banks already a long time ago um how long ago do you think well just in the last couple of years I would have thought what was it or did we get that at our community board I thought we got it here oh myself all right okay but they have been here but it was a long time ago it was more than two years ago right okay no worries all right I don't think there's any change just save my nose thanks all those in favor say aye all right it's kerry okay welcome hello move on to your um three
Yeah okay so just be vigilant of declarations of interest please let us know if you have a conflict uh item three confirmation previous minutes do I have a mover tim seconded sam put that motion all those in favor say aye aye against that's carried public forum there is none deputations none today petitions none so item seven is the minutes of the waimakariri zone committee um so that's actually four sets of minutes for some reason they
Thank you I have a number of apologies from councillor chuang goff for lateness uh councillor galloway for early departure and councillor major for absence um do I have someone to move them aaron seconded by sarah all those in favor okay I'm unaware of any declarations of interest so I'm assuming there are none uh confirmation of minutes from 10th of march moved jake second pauline all those in favor we have one public forum from chris baxter welcome chris I have five minutes um to support chris welcome michelle so yes I'm just putting a proposal for a um between the little shops and the red zone on stanley road um a bit of background for me I'm a member of the inner city east linwood revitalization committee and also a member of the greening the east so what we're proposing here is a temporary um cycle way in order to get it in part of the um into the green corridor and the linwood village street streetscaping so the greening the east project one of the main focuses is a green corridor can see on the list on the map there and there's also there's a streetscaping project along the lingerie south so those are both coming up hopefully in the long-term plan but neither of them at this stage have a cycleway component so what we'd like to do is get a temporary cycle way in place before that happens so that it can be included within the existing budgets um so why do we need it here what we're saying so the green in the east has sort of identified stanley road is a pretty important link between um the linwood village and the um avon corridor um and I've as you can see from that photo it's not that nice to walk up and down or cycle up and down at the moment so it's pretty important to get that link there to get people from the linwood village to use the the red zone and also to allow people that are using that red zone for recreation running cycling dive walking etc to get up into malinois village and hopefully um um so just got a few other photos here sort of what it looks like at the moment so there is an existing cycle way going from the richmond end of stanley road up to the bridge so it's providing extending that as well um so that sort of influenced that sort of um connection there and there's also a proposal at some point of of potentially pushing that further forward up to the um to the um phillipstown hub um but yeah so what we're posing at this stage is try to get it on the plan because it's going to save money getting it at this stage rather than just sort of adding it later um it'll make it better because we can get it into the design we can get rather than just taking it onto the side um that's pretty much me thank you chris do you want to add anything michelle uh just to um just to reiterate that what chris is saying in terms of the importance of with the streetscape work happening that that there is it zone because there are a lot of people that are using the red zone and coming and going from other parts of town really keen to have a way to bring them down into the into linwood village particularly once the streetscape's done and also just that this is a prime time for it to happen excellent um thanks to this so just the question so when you talk about cycle lanes are you actually referring to the cycle ways you're referring to cycle lanes or separated cycle well because there's going to be a design process for um the green corridor and the streetscaping I'd like to not be overly prescriptive and what we actually propose and lead it up to the designers of those two projects just make sure they have some form of cycle infrastructure okay excellent um we've got time for another question if someone has a question yeah now as I understand at the planning stage yeah so that's that's the that's part of the um the urgency if you will is to to to that we it while that project's taking place so this one's talking about the stan moore along stanmore road between the um the streetscape is yep okay yes no that's that's fine and I've I'll cut you off there because it hit the five minute but I've got a resolution there just to make sure this doesn't get lost and then we can refer it to the right people and it definitely can be considered amongst that wider work and local connections that are being done but thank you very much for your time cheers jake do you want to move that respiration you only happen to second it confused about it um I just I think we do need to make sure that's actual get the information on the project as well yeah because we just had the greening the yeah um corridor thing at board yesterday and a lot of stuff was considered out of scope and this is like you know important so it'd be good to get it included but we do need a bit of understanding about thank you all right all those in favor thank you there's no deputations by appointment and no uh petitions uh so we'll move to item seven uh twenty twenty one after our bike challenge and so the 2021 rtro bike challenge uh

for the private plan change pretty sure everyone's aware of this is why just see if there's someone wants to move it sarah seconded melanie is there any questions all those in favour opposed carried thank you over here against aaron okay aaron against sorry thank you I'll get you just to give a brief overview of this paper okay so this is a report for notification of a plan changes that we're proposing and we've been working with um brad thompson here from the organization um and we went closely with the the uh the bank's peninsula on this so this is a plan change to really enable more pop-up housing in the um zones across the peninsula and to remove some of the impediments to house housing development there around certainly around setbacks and earthworks and some of the um some of the the the site coverage um versions as well which has prevented some houses being built we've uh had a lot of engagement with roonagha there's been um done hui with the with the renault across peninsula and we've also presented this to the committee as well so yeah happy to take any questions any questions I know someone wants to aaron over sarah um thank you just very briefly I'd like to thank and acknowledge staff for what I know is a um yeah this work and um I think this really shows the value of the good relationships that we've developed with um local roonanga and particularly the value of the te hononga papa tipa running committee as well where there's been some very positive discussion about this and where there's been the opportunity for answers and concerns to be raised and questions asked and answered the um changes that were made to the pepper king zones in the district plan review as we've seen from various presentations and work that's been presented as this has been developed in many cases even though the intention was good or unworkable and this plan change actually gives effects to if it's implemented and gives effect to the changes that were made in the district plan review so that they are able to be implemented and so that we can realistically look at these um zones been developed alongside the wishes of the runanga um realizing this only relates to planning um there are matters of infrastructure that obviously need to be dealt with as a separate matter going on alongside the um development contributions policy proposal which will look at realistic proposition to allow development in the papakai zones from a development contributions point of view as well so I absolutely welcome this um I think it's a great piece of work and I look forward to seeing it progress thank you anyone else I'll put that all that's in favor opposed carried um I'm just going to adjourn for five minutes just to make sure that we're okay to move on to the last item so we'll start back at bypass restart the meeting yeah we'll head to that so you could give the answer okay so item eight diamond harbour wharf upgrade uh welcome andrew and sylvia I'll get you to go over this and also um just talk to your engagement with naughty too please sure quick introduction I guess the the upgrade of the diamond harbor wolf has been a topic for quite a few years now there's increasing number of people using the ferry for transport purposes essentially this report is requesting that phase so there's a lot more work to do yet and that will enable us to get accurate costings as well and that will come back to the committee for endorsement before we proceed on to the next stage um sylvia would you like to comment on the consultation with nader vicki certainly so last year we initially made contact with natasha to share them with them an outline of the project given outline of the project scope we also shared with them the draft concept later then that was followed up as we started to prepare the resource consent application our environmental consultant was following up discussions and providing updates on um the project as it progressed and the feedback from natasha has been that they note that this is a small scale project the next steps that we would look to following today's decision would be to finalise the draft resource consent application which would be shared with native for their comment before being submitted thank you are there any questions if we approached nzta for funding I think richard be able to answer um um not but some of this project given it has a public transport component to it may be eligible for nzta funding so that's a discussion we need to have with them and if the approval was gone if the approval was given today to go through the detailed design that's a discussion we can have with them right and just under um 7.1 I do find it particularly hard to follow our budget process when we we're not given the project id so can you just tell me in terms of our long-term plan or our annual plan what the project ideas that's paying for this and what did you come back to on are you talking about our cpms project id it just says like preliminary cost estimates received during concept develop indicate that the project were delivered with an existing harbor and marine structures budget yeah is there an actual I'm just trying to understand where the money is coming from is there an actual diamond harbor do you want to know the extent of the budget or the project id number well in our long term plan is paying for this yes there is yeah so just in future can we reference that project id um because just the report makes it seem like there's another budget that's paying for lots of other things in terms of harboring rent structures but if there's a discrete budget for this it'd be quite helpful to know what year the money's in and what the project id is so I don't know if it's yeah so there's money in this year and there's also money in the long term plan but we can when we bring back the detail design we'll absolutely bring back all of the funding details so there is money on budget as as referred to but it's specifically for this project not for any of the other marine structures there's there are two budgets there is a there is a an explicit one for diamond harbor yeah there's also a program budget okay for re for warf renewal so there's two elements to this project one is wharf so they can be funded from both streams but once we have the detailed costings that's when we'll bring back that level of detail okay so just to reiterate this project won't proceed beyond a design without further endorsement yeah and you've got my amendment as well thanks john can you put that up yeah can we put up biannual's amendment and I think jake's agreed to second it do you want me to speak to it oh wait others might have questions I'll wait for other stuff questions that's right you can take other questions now if you want didn't have questions on this I'm gonna have to write the whole thing out yeah okay I'm not gonna worry about that all right you're gonna reload all right I'm gonna roll it out of order okay you can say what it was yeah so um I was trying to I think actually we should be building a bridge so I was going to move that we actually built a bridge because it's much more point to the littleton harbour um well that's to be sourced out of the marine structures budget why do you want a second that still has points across a little yeah yeah yeah it's interesting that jan has raised this before we've had the opportunity to discuss it our community board but I imagine there would be some support but it's been really order so we can't progress it which is a shame all right yeah okay I think you've got a couple of people yanni anyhow first of all do we have someone that wants this I'll second that okay debate um thank you I mean as noted this project's been planned um and looked forward to by the community for a very long time this represents significant safety and accessibility improvements and we've got to bear in mind that this is an important piece of public transport infrastructure it may have recreational use but its principal purpose is a piece of pt infrastructure there have been a number of incidents a number of near misses and a number of down to the ferry particularly when there are rough seas and the ferries moving against the steps or when the steps are wet and slippery um and what we're proposing here will absolutely address these issues it'll actually see those stairs replaced um with this um gangway and pontoon the importance of the slope of the gangway is particularly important for accessibility if you think of people with limited mobility people with push chairs and so on um the the the gangway and its gradient is particularly important in that regard there's very strong support in the diamond harbour community for what we're doing here I was at the diamond harbour community station community associations agm earlier in this week where there were around 200 people in the room and I had very positive feedback from the community not only on the project itself um and there's a compliment for staff here um on the consultation and engagement processes and the way that the engagement have been conducted with the community as well so I'm very happy to support this today and I'm last time I was over there I uh and went on that wharf I did look at it with the with this lens on and um consider that there are this is definitely needed um that part diamond harbor there is also one of those what you call a mini tourism gem that a lot of people from christchurch should go to littleton jump on that boat and go over just for a wee day trip take kids take your parents whatever but it is an absolute gem to go do and I would have supported yanI's bridge especially if we could have used that island in the middle of the harbor as a prison as well um would have been because once the prison closed lots of years later it became a really good tourist attraction so just let's keep our minds open yani yeah I'm just to say I don't know how many councils remember the deputation we had it must have been about six years ago um and when people showed us the images of what it was like for people getting on who's now got a had a wee child who's you know when she was younger took her there on the ferry and it is really dangerous so I think this is a no-brainer we need to improve the safety and the accessibility and this project will do that I would I do think we need to approach nzta and I don't know whether you want to formally record that but this is a public transport project and it would be good to try and make sure that we're maximizing any opportunity for external funding from nzta cool thanks pauline I'm quite familiar with the diamond harbour wharf from my childhood and I'm really pleased to see that the bike shed is going to be retained and I think that there's probably quite a few heritage items on that wharf that I'd like to be taking care of if possible in this process so but above all I'm supportive of it because it is not safe at the moment so well done thank you so I'll put that motion all those with the karakia from castle timberton fishing fishing thank you you
Item eight diamond harbour wharf upgrade uh welcome andrew and sylvia I'll get you to go over this and also um just talk to your engagement with naughty 1952 please sure quick introduction I guess the up the upgrade of the diamond harbor wharf has been a topic for quite a few years now um there's increasing number of people using the ferry for transport purposes essentially this report is requesting that we move a preferred concept through to a detailed design phase so there's a lot more work to do yet and that will enable us to get accurate um costings as well and that will come back to um the committee for endorsement before we proceed on to the next stage um sylvia would you like to comment on the consultation with native hickey certainly so um last year we initially made contact with natasha to share them with them an outline of the project given outline the project scope we also shared with them the draft concept and later then that was followed up as we started to prepare the resource consent application our um the project as it progressed and the feedback from natasha has been that they note that this is a small scale project um the next steps that we would look to following today's decision would be to finalise the draft resource consent application which would be shared with nataseki for their comment before being submitted thank you are there any questions if we approached nzta for funding uh I think richard be up to answer that question um I'm not aware whether they've been approached or not but some of this project given it has a public transport component to it may be eligible for nzta funding so that's a discussion we need to have with them and if the approval was gone if the approval was given today to go through the detailed design that's a discussion we can have with them right and just under um 7.1 I do find it particularly hard to follow a budget process when we we're not given the project id so can you just tell me in terms of our long-term plan or our annual and what do you come back to are you talking about our cpms project id it just says like preliminary cost estimates received during concept develop indicate that the project will deliver with an existing harbor and marine structures budget yeah is there an actual I'm just trying to understand where the money is coming from is there an actual right harbor do you want to know the extent of the budget or the project id number well is there a specific project for the diamond harbour bridge in our long-term plan yes yes there is yeah so just in the future can we reference that project id um because just the report makes it seem like there's another budget that's paying for lots of other things in terms of harboring rent structures but if there's a discrete budget for this it'd be quite helpful to know what year the money's in and what the project id is so I don't know if that's yeah so there's money in this year and there's also money in the

the whole thing out okay I'm not gonna worry about that all right you're going to reload all right I'm going to roll it out of order okay you can say what it was yeah so I'm I was trying to I think actually we should be building a bridge so I was going to move that we actually built a bridge because it's much more sustainable and it reduces the carbon emissions yeah from stoddard point to the littleton harbour um well that's to be sourced out of the marine structures budget why'd you want a second it's interesting that jan has raised this before we've had the opportunity to discuss it at our community board but I imagine there would be some support yeah okay I think you've got a couple of people yanni anyhow first of all move on andrew would like to there's no more questions um thank you I mean as noted this project's been planned um and looked forward to by the community and accessibility improvements um and we've got to bear in mind that this is an important piece of public transport infrastructure it may have recreational use but its principal purpose is a piece of pt infrastructure there have been a number of incidents a number of near misses and a number of safety

community as well so I'm very happy to support this today and I'm really progressing eric yeah I fully support this and and the last time I was over there I uh and went on that wharf I did look at it with the with this lens on and um considered that there are this is definitely needed um that part diamond harbour there is also one of those what you call a mini tourism gym that a lot of people from christchurch should go to littleton jump on that boat and go over just for a wee day trip take kids take your parents whatever but it is an absolute gem to go do and I would have supported yanI's bridge especially if we could have used that island in the middle of the harbor as a prison as well um would have been because once the prison closed lots of just let's keep our minds open yanny I'm just to say I don't know how many councils remember the deputation we had it must have been about six years ago um and when people showed us the images of what it was like for people getting on and off the ferry um I i know someone who's now got a had a wee child who's you know when she was younger took her there on the ferry and it is really dangerous so I think this is a no-brainer we need to improve the safety and the accessibility and this project will do that I would I do think we need to approach nzta and I don't know whether you want to formally record that but this is a public

I'm supportive of it because it is not safe at the moment so well done thank you I'll put that motion all those in favor post carried and we'll close the meeting with the current care from
Thank you and then um item 11 civic financial services the statement of intent um so just noting the two resolutions that are in front of us particularly resolution two about some next steps there um linda was there any comment that you wanted to make on this uh yes I just wanted to not so much talk about what's in the soi but to mention that civic financial services used to be an insurance company to local authorities and it had had its own statute which provided a governance framework as a result it was exempted from the cco provisions of the lga but in the meantime it's transitioned its business away from insurance and into funds management or administering funds uh kiwisaver funds for local authority um employees the insurance act that it was subject to has been repealed and it's now got no governing legislation other than your general business legislation like our companies act um as a result we don't get a draft soi we get a final soi so we don't get that opportunity to provide comments although it wouldn final they would if they didn't want to do it they wouldn't change their soi we've since I wrote this report we've had a letter from them saying which they send every year saying that their annual general meeting will be in june I think it is uh and we've got all councils have got until 18th of april to put any nominations up for board positions you might recall last year we put two nominations up because we were concerned that a number of members of the board had served very lengthy terms the board members this year that are up for um who are retiring by rotation and have put themselves up for re-election uh the chair tony marriott who's served 13 years and director john melville who's who served eight years uh a very a very long-serving director who had been on there for 16 years retired this year and the board has co-opted a new member and the problem there is that auckland and christchurch councils have between them 32 and the remainder of their shareholding is split between difficult to and for them with such small holdings to be particularly incentivised to vote against the status quo last year we put up our two candidates they weren't successful partly because uh auckland council had at a staff level uh agreed with our position that the the board members had served sufficient time and the board needed to be refreshed but when it came to voting they didn't follow through potentially putting up two nominations at the one time to a long-standing board was I think this is something we perhaps need to take offline um you know and something that we would then bring back by way is a proper report to the meeting if there was a decision for the committee to make I'm interested rather than in the detail of what happened last year and discussing individuals um I'm particularly interested in the the timeline so we've got the agm which happens in june uh yeah and we've always um passed we've always had resolutions for the agm brought to this meeting prior so that we've got um report coming with all of that any considerations around directors is something that we could put into that report as well would the timelines work though no no at that point uh it'll be too late we've got a window between now and the 18th of april to to make any nominations and after that we can only vote on what they have on their agenda all right but you're not suggesting that we should make any changes to this resolution in front of us today because we don't have information on that that's correct yeah so I think this is something we need to take offline and if there's something that needs to be brought back to somewhere for a decision prior to the 18th of april let's work out how we build that in okay all right but let's let's take that offline and bring it back in a proper paper with written information of whatever decisions we need to make at that time rather than just the verbal update that you're providing us now all right thank comment on this um statement of intent all right thank you very much indeed sam and I don't know how other people feel but what wouldn't I wonder if we could just delegate to the mayor and deputy me the ability to make the nominations on our behalf delegate to who sorry the mayor and the deputy mayor yeah rather than bringing if you guys are happy with that it might just speed it up yeah I think that sensibly avoids having to come back for a decision and clear it's a disguise we need to have a proper discussion about it rather than um it just means yeah we can move and then the only other thing is we're going to put a timeline in there I think we discussed earlier on point two I think diane had some wording that's right so we were just going to add there within the next six months so if we can just build that into resolution two and just set some expectation around the timing for that six six months six months yeah all right and um director nominations you'll still be bringing the report that we normally get around appointing a proxy and deciding on any resolutions so moved by sam seconded by um james daniels so I just had some questions yeah no I'll come back to questions I'm just want to get these resolutions sorted first and then I'll come back to any outstanding questions delegate to the mayor and deputy mayor um nomination nomination director nominations for the um annual general meeting um yeah delegate to the deputy mayor and deputy mayor decisions on director nominations for the upcoming annual general meeting yep that's fine linda that works doesn't it that's good yep all right fantastic so moved by um moved by sam mcdonald and seconded by james daniels and we're not done with questions yet so yani I'll come back to you thanks um can you can you just advise um what what sort of but just from reading this we're not getting dividends from them anymore so what's our shareholding worth value terms we the only dividend of any they sold their building and we got a special dividend for that they've never been in a position to pay I mean there might have been small dividends um our shareholding we can't divest because there's nobody to buy it so what would happen if we just pull out um it was still bound by the lap work that they've undertaken through um historical insurance work so there's still an ongoing trail of activity in that space but as linda pointed out the key focus for them now is superannuation and the administration of the super easy schemes and they've chosen um as effective from last year that they see more benefit in retaining or reducing their profitability to support those reduced fees for all of those members right so that's how they see their their role as being an opportunity how many of our members or staff are actually members of that scheme like do we know what the benefit is actually to us for them reducing the fees but is there any advantage um only in so far that perhaps it effectively be yeah the number we don't have of our staff being a participant at the a lot of the smaller um councils are it's very attractive for those members um so therefore and auckland does have a very high proportion of membership to their schemes so our one we don't we're l1 is high I did look for that information I just can't remember what the answer is um I did look at that last year because I was concerned about risk if we were recommending it but um we could include that in the paper that's coming out for the agm if that will help I think well I think so like the main element of intent um I mean I'm getting positive commentary from um diane around um you know the supply of that service to this council and I think we need to remember that we're just one shareholder along with a number of other councils in an organization which is providing a service to a number of councils so for us to take a particularly christchurch centric be the the best way forward but why don't we think about how we can deal with the matters that yanI's raising um in terms of the preparation for the agm the paper that's coming um because that's obviously where any resolutions for the agm would be detailed rather than for the statement of intent and obviously the consideration around the delegation in item three yeah would take into account what we expect the organization to be doing in the next period as well yeah and I mean just reading these predictions like it's a tiny scheme 2.4 million dollars I mean they get 2.5 million revenue and it's 2.1 million of expenses like in the scheme of things it seems tiny it wouldn't take you know that many people to get those sorts of figures in across the country so so I mean again I'm not hearing you suggesting any change to the statement of intent there are obviously some matters of interest that may be better considered in terms of any resolutions for the agm rather than in regard to on any um further questions all right so this is moved and seconded um I'll put the motion all those in favor say I against as carried thank you all right so now moving to
So we're going to move to item nine um submission principles for the private plan change um pretty sure everyone's aware of this is why just um see if there's someone wants to move it seconded melanie is there any questions all those in favor opposed carried thank you are we against darren okay sorry I didn't didn't hear you
Welcome back we're going to get started we've got quorum so we now move on to the art strategy implementation update um nigel if you're able to and nigel and kitty if you're welcome if you could um give us a quick talk through you know this had been a couple of questions through um so if you're able to talk to us about those that'd be great thanks thought I intend to go through start with a couple of clarifications and intuitive just corrections in the report to go through if that's okay and then kitty you'll give a bit of no view of to tahi and then in terms of a brief briefing on what we've done so far so just wanted to clarify that in terms of 5.4 and turn it was supposed to say the 19th of february 2021 not february 19. we haven't been two years since the approval and principal so it was february um 2021 on the 19th that that happened the other one is just to highlight the importance of this being co-created strategy with partners but for the ability for anyone and everyone to participate and be part of the implementation of toyota so it's not a christchurch city council strategy that we're driving ourselves we're a partner to it but with others and the other one intended to go through the figures that that were in this plan that were proved in principle by the partners in february in terms of the 130 000 that's circa committed to this and it will go through funding rounds with those partners council's contribution to that is about twenty thousand dollars um which is in existing budgets and it's work that we already do that's been aligned to toa to tahi so just wanted to clarify that um and that's on top of all the other work we've done and you would have seen by email this morning just as an overview uh some of the work plan that the arts team has going on and how they've aligned that to the outcomes of toyota as well that's great thank you very could though the work plan that we're developing that we had developed as a team in council is responding to the key priorities from the strategy and we are in a way we're drafting that to um bring the partners on board with to support the delivery of the strategy and that's the work that's underway at the moment with partners that's great thank you very much do we have some questions jeremy that's a 5.4 I just want to know that you create all those three years the program activities whether it's under the action plan or implementation plan of art strategies part of them or separate so so in terms of the the agreement principle is aligned specifically to the art strategy so in terms of the funding from partners will contribute to in terms of delivery purely against tuak totahi and this is in addition to what they already do so right for example credit z already provide funding to the sector this is um over and above that but in a moment we have no lease action plan am have no no this one we have an internal one that the arts team um deliver against in other parts of council of course are supporting the delivery of the strategy we are working on a joined up plan and that's that's what's uh again current conversation with the strategy partners okay thank you thank you yani yeah thanks um I'm just looking at the document that we got sent through I presume is that the one that's coming out of the arts office this this project the the the paper you've got in front of you was an indication of the the items that are in front of the different partners to be funded so in terms of when we talk about the funding of the communication plans websites community art participation huis workshops residencies and master classes and research and projects they are part of the things that the that was agreed in principle in february uh to be done uh what we're waiting for before that's actually confirmed is for each of those partners to go through their funding's not just a 12 month it's over a period of of four financial years but three calendar years if you went through that so so things like for example will you list certain neighborhoods um as key creative communities how do we have input into where those areas are so we're undertaking as an arts team at the moment um uh some um desktop analysis of what's happening we're in christchurch because that's that's of use to us and it's of use to to communicating with citizens and connecting them to opportunities that are close to their home um but we're also interested in those areas which have um perhaps a higher density of arts businesses or arts organizations and inactivity based and so we're just starting to look at what what they what those neighborhoods look like what's going on and what is attracting so we're at least like littleton cinema in new brighton is that an assumption that work will happen in those areas ahead of areas like woolston or sumner or mount pleasant or wherever the initial assessment of what's going on where so that we can map that because we don't have a comprehensive map of where activity is taking place what we're also noting though is that our initial analysis would be that there are areas where there are pockets of either activity and businesses established such as sydney and areas where there is some reputation or heightened activity or conversation between the arts community around those places having a creative vibe perhaps okay and the other question I had was around natoi maori plan is naitahu or tipuna kokori involved with us yeah we have a representative of manufenua participating at the the steering group level and we are working on on further engagement so that we we develop a plan with the mighty arts sector in particular so is there a sorry um for my ignorance but is there a specific group that's set up in terms of the maori sector or no no there isn't one overarching group that that we could go to and have that conversation um in the mighty arts sector I um you know the um committee but maybe maybe people want to raise it there who are on it and see how they can work together I would have thought with things like the red house and all the other things that we're looking at so yani you're starting to get quite a long way beyond the scope of the actual report today this was the document I got that was about what we were doing so that was additional to the actual report that's on the agenda um but it's really clear that it would be really good for us to generally have an update on the broader um in in one place rather than um ad hoc I think so so rather than getting the detail today then is there a process for the actions that are proposed to come back to us for governance input and if so what would that be I've just asked for an update a broader update which we can have either a briefing session or something like that um on the arts um implementation and it may at we can have a look at the um sorry the staff implementation plan that you're looking at and whether we need to formalize that I think you're missing the point so um so the strategy partners have agreed in principle to a plan right yeah what I'm trying to understand is at what point do we see the detail of that plan and have the ability to put things in or change things that is beyond the scope of today's report which is why I have asked for us to get an update which will include that information right so there's no risk of agreeing to this today just then be told that the plan's already been agreed with our partners and we're unable to change it the purpose of today is to provide an update in terms of where we're at we're not asking we're not approving anything we're receiving information this this work is currently delegated to staff and so we will be getting an update at some stage soon so we'll make sure we meeting of strategy partners on feb nights was held staff presented a proposal for a three-year program of activity um and and so there is a proposal for work all I'm trying to understand is if when it comes back to us will it be too late for us to make changes to that program of activity or will we be within scope to do that in terms of to for that in terms of to go through what that's relying on is funding and commitment from the partners to complete some of the pieces of work so when I said at the start they searched for 130 000 towards the implementation of council's contributions about 20 000 so in terms of the partners and what they were committing to to do we can bring that back once that's confirmed and to let you know but in terms of our the council's ability to change what those partners have committed to yeah we'll be limited yeah it's not our role to improve what other partners are doing in the art space no and I think also is once we have the funding rounds completed and we know exactly what's going to happen and at the same time we have some benchmarking work that's been completed at the moment was funded by creative nz to actually be able to articulate what difference uh toyoto tahi has made to the creative sector in in tahi so we'll work through that and we'll bring that back so the intention is that there will be one report that will go to all strategy partners to the sector to let them know what has happened but the difference that's been made as opposed to a list of tasks that have been completed we actually want to have some benchmarks but it's just so unclear we're being told what's happening we don't have any governance input into the priorities because what I've heard is we've got an agreed program and um our staff presented the proposal for a three-year program so you can say it's not just council it's our staff that did that program as is some high-level governance that we've given a direction staff have delegations and we are going to get an update you have heard this about four or five times now we will be getting an update on the stuff that you have asked for but it's not within the scope of this report today so do I have a mover yep thanks sam tim thank you very much any debate we've got to get out we've got to get out I've just been told what's happening I mean honestly like we sign off on strategies we should actually be having some governance oversight of the implementation of those strategies in a position to know what's being done when what's not being done and why and what priorities are being put forward but at the moment for us to be told that a program of activity has been presented to our stakeholders to have had no governance oversight or input into that program and then be told that you'll just get an update and be told what's happening I just find involved in development of strategies and starting off on strategies as a council that it is our role at a governance level to look at how those strategies are being delivered and to have an ability to raise concerns around where the priorities are if things aren't happening or things are being redirected unfortunately I think um the the report in front of us today is asking us to agree to a program of work which we're now being told we cannot have any input into and and will only simply be given updates on and I totally disagree with that we have to make decisions around funding priorities that will be something we do on an individual basis as the applications come in but there are some wider issues in the arts sector that I think we should be absolutely turning our mind to um so I i can't support this today I support the intent of what staff are proposing but I do think that we should have had a briefing on the proposed program of activity and an opportunity at a governance level to been signed off there are things that are not happening things that are delayed things that have changed and I think it's only fair that we have an ability to influence that thank you any further debate tim thank you I totally disagree I think that it's for us to partner with the arts community that's what we've instructed our staff to do that's what they have done I don't think any anyone around this table could really call themselves an artist um but I don't think well well yeah I think there's a few artists maybe but we won't go there but I just our staff have gone to the community arts community they've gone in with an open mind they've gone there and talked with them and the regards to the meeting of february the 19th I just can't understand why this is just such an issue it's an issue by one person I think that it's great it's going to be good to hear from our community and the arts community are put it that way so I think our staff are doing the absolutely outstanding job there is never enough money in the arts there's always a lot of support but the money is an issue but um I think the staff have done an outstanding job trying to get them all together and move forward with uh strategy and I look forward to the update as the chair has mentioned what five or six times now thank you anything further jimmy if we review the council the community outcome particularly regarding to the resilient community arts is equally you know to the culture heritage sport and recreation that's very very crucial you know to comply you know implementation and our resilient community I'm happy because council we adopt this kind of art strategy probably at least one year ago so the how to implement those strategy more effectively efficiently and can totally achieve our goal of our community outcomes very very crucial and important but at least in today we are happy to listen to uh from the office you know feedback to us the this update more better you know what is all the action plan implementation what is a time frame because I review those uh paragraph 5.4 in the 5.5 5.4 we emphasize for the next program and the three years activity about 5.5 we establish financials four years let's how about one more year where the funding uh comes from that's my my particular concern even next time staff or office can flip us more clearly regarding the time frame regarding all those actions even pay pension plan give our overall picture not give us more confidence to implement this one this I look forward to anyone further no so all of those in favor of receiving the information in the report please say aye aye any against oh so I declare that carried kempI's record yanis vote against thank you very much

Just note that confirmation of previous minutes um I'm happy to move the previous minutes do I have a seconder just someone to second the minutes jake mcclellan all those in favor say aye against that's carried and um then public forum um nothing today deputations by appointment there are none today and presentation of petitions there are none today so that then um sees us moving to item seven the performance exceptions report um so I'd welcome peter ryan to the table peter um good morning thank you um if there are any remarks that you'd like to make on this report we'll take it as read and then we'll move to questions thank you and good morning um no there are no real detailed remarks to make uh the levels of service and uh to some extent the capital projects results are extremely consistent with the last five months they're probably a fair indication of where we will land at year end and there isn't really much else to report uh the the level of service results in particular have they're not varying less than one percent so they're very stable position uh much of what remains will depend on the resident survey results and we've undertaken to give you a uh rough and early look at those results rather than waiting till late in the year and presenting a polished result in may when it's a little bit too late to do anything but the remaining results will often hinge on that on those surveys the other more objective results to some extent we're affected by uh process issues around covert so there is that factor there as well but by and large we're fairly consistent with previous years within a few percent of the organizational target and very stable excellent thank you very much so just a couple of questions on the um resident survey results if I can so I'm good to hear that um once you've got those results and have an opportunity to have a look at them we'll be getting an early heads up on what they look like when will the when will this month's report would contain those preliminary results we would normally only have the package of results to you in early may yep but the raw data so putting aside pretty graphs and and presentation the raw data should be available for next month's report excellent now we just opened we just opened reporting yesterday so I do need to talk to some people about exactly what percentage of that data will be available over the next week but I believe that most of it will be and we should be able to give it directly to the managers now there is the issue I should canvas here that if it appears in next month's report uh that data will go will be public at that point we can't report it without it becoming of course yeah of course and chair you will appreciate I haven't seen any of it yet myself yeah absolutely all right so so let's keep a good joined up approach to this yes and expect there'll be at the very least some update next month um possibly the report um yeah let's just keep a good joined up approach to that I mean the important thing is that once the information is available and has been considered the reports are updated with it and the other important thing from our point of view of course is that that's something we'd be taking into account as part of our long-term plan um considerations alongside the community feedback that we're getting through the consultation period at the moment as well of course all right so thank you for that update um let's move on to any further questions on this report are there any questions jimmy question on pages 32 we got into a packs and a full shield the target hundred percent customers uh service request numbers eight or sixty six percent but you're answering here due to the closure of several out of date historical uh customer service request numbers I can't understand what I mean I can't really speak for andrew in detail here but I think what he's saying is that there have been historically some csrs that to a final statistic that it's come out at 66 percent okay but I think probably this one if you close should be the percentage it should be high rather than rather than law so not if you've exceeded the time frame second question is on page 35 regarding citizen and the customer service delivery time target is 90 seconds one half minutes but year to date is more than two minutes but here particular mentioned starving constraint has been our biggest hurdle in recent weeks let's show the staff in the right shoulder task force oh I think it can be taken at face value that they have been short of staff and that they do have people about to commence to address that so the about is up to uh more than two minutes there's a particular is average only average yes an average speed to answer yes okay thank you thank you mike um page 22. actually I'll probably potentially ask this one the next one the the exceptions around the major cycleway should I just save that for the for the that's fine anything else on this report yawning thanks um just on the measure more people are choosing to travel by bus which page um that's on page 30. um I was just interested if uh we've got any information about the success or otherwise of the real-time information system um I have put questions into office the ce to try and understand the extent of the failure of that system for buses and I think we were going to get something back and I know we're looking at a new system we had a youth advisory meeting a few weeks ago where we've got a youth action plan from 2017 which one of the actions is to fix the real-time information on the buses so I guess it's just a question around the remedial action because we're not getting more people choosing to go by bus we're not meeting our target and I just wondered whether we're making any steps to improve people's understanding of how the system works given it's been an issue that's been raised in the remedial action when some very obvious things seem to be at play that could be done um through you mr chair we are putting in a new rti a real time information system and I haven't got an exact date for when that will be delivered but obviously we need to work closely with environment canterbury on that because as I think I mentioned last time they have to go at specific bus stops they have to be on the buses and they have to also be at the bus interchange so all three components need to speak to each other so we're in the middle of kind of rolling that out now um and I expect it certainly will be in this year but I can't give an exact date on when that will be done because the thing that people keep saying to me is if the real-time information system is incorrect and inaccurate it's a real deterrent it would be better to turn it off and not have incorrect information been given for people so that they just wait for the extent of the problem with the current real-time information system and what steps are being taken to ensure that when people want to catch a bus they can either find out by calling when it's coming or um they don't get the inaccurate information so you know I've had several people raise this concern with me and I just am not clear like why our response would be to continue to use the system that's not working if that's indeed the case so it's not that the system is not working completely but it certainly is past its use by date hence the reason why we're replacing it but it is still preferable from our perspective to keep it going because it does have benefits and it is important um but yeah we admit it's not perfect and hence the reason why it's been replaced so to add to that if we're in a replacement mode when that is completed it is clearly important that there is very good communication to the public to tell them that there is something information that is there otherwise they will have a view that they can't necessarily trust it I i get that but the feedback that I'm currently getting from people that are going trying to catch the bus is they keep getting the wrong information they keep getting told the bus is coming 20 minutes later when it actually comes in a minute or two minutes time so we've improved the frequency along like ferry road and yet the real-time information is still giving people very very wrong information but I don't I don't know the extent of the problem but what people are saying to me is they'd rather not be given incorrect information then then you know then and then not just kind of expect the bus to come then be told it's coming 20 minutes later to have it was passed while they're going to go do something else in terms of the real-time existing real-time information system um like I said there is issues with it it's not perfect hence the reason why we are replacing it but keeping it in place until we put the new system in outweigh the cost of having some of it not working as we'd like because we can like picking up on the chief executive's point is there any communications that we can give to the community to help them understand that it's not working on areas where it's broken because I don't have any sense we scale of the problem or where exactly it's not not working versus where it is the the intention is to um once we roll out the new system is to have a community we have a communications plan around that and people will be made aware of it once it's implemented um but it's not um as simple as simply saying some parts of it don't work as well as others so it's it's I don't know whether that's possible to put something out there to say some parts of the system don't work I would suggest that that's likely to result in miscommunication and misunderstanding of the system the actual problem is that the system has become redundant and needs replaced and hence the reason why we're replacing it um I can't really say too much more than that um that's the reason why we're replacing it it's it's not perfect we've reported that it hasn't been perfect for a long period of time um we've sent numerous memos to councillors on it um so it's it's not news um and that's the reason why we're replacing it and we've got funding in the ltp to do that so um so you're anticipating it will be completed in this financial year um maybe not this financial year through you mr chair but but not too far after that is my understanding but I can't give you an exact date at the moment but I my understanding is will be q3 can we get an update on that I mean clearly there's some urgency around it um I mean yanI's point about incorrect information been provided I guess there's a information at all or not um the important thing is if we know there's a problem there's funds on budget or there will be funds on budget through the ltp to do it that we prioritize this and get it done as soon as possible and if we can get a memo around those timelines and just to give some favor it seems like with the new scheduling when the frequency was increased that's what's created the problem so you know we've got buses going I think it's every 10 minutes up the main roads now okay um I mean we've been told that we've got a system that isn't working and it needs to be replaced um what we need to know is when that replacement is going to happen okay further questions pauline yep sure um what page um page 25 just with the leakage rate it doesn't seem to be coming down at all and we've actually we have as far as I know been putting in some remediation for instance prioritizing the leakages and getting we've been told getting on top of that leakage so why isn't that figure changing or is this sort of slightly older data I think this is one for john yeah john hi um it's it's not likely to change um greatly for about five years because we have a five-year rolling program of doing leak detection throughout the city um so it's it's a difficult one and we're not going to see an instantaneous response to our leakage rate with an instantaneous replacement of a pipe because we don't measure a pipe by pipe we measure it zone by zone so is it more a matter of data recording or is it actual are you saying the leakage is being slowed but the data is showing us it's not we're saying that the renewal program will significantly improve the leakage rate yes but the methodology we use to measure it doesn't reflect that instantaneously that's a bit concerning isn't it because it's still sitting this is this is something that will hopefully be um improved area so we'll have bulk water meters and instantaneous measurements of flows and that will give us a very good understanding of what leakage rates are in these areas once we've had that smart smart area and we then roll it out throughout the rest of the city depending on what the results of that are right so when you're expecting that to be finished that zone or this month oh very good question um it's part of a reform water reform package so it's probably about a year away and we've lit out we're letting our tenders for the supply of that the instrumentations with that very soon so you're saying what you're saying is once you get the raffiti um trial done you could transfer that expectation into another zone if you've done the same we could do if the council chooses to fund that through the ltp right okay thank you thanks john thank you are there any further questions that people want to raise on this all right so I'm happy to move that we second all those in favor say aye against that's carried so now let's move to item eight the capital project performance report and ruth thank you for joining us again we'll take the report as read are there any particular parts of this report you want to draw our attention to or any comments that you'd like to make thank you good morning everyone uh so this is the report to the end of february uh 2021 uh I'll speak to the current financial year first so page 43 our current financial year forecasts against our core program budget of 375.5 our project managers are still forecasting a spend of 380.3 so we're still in a bring back position against the core program against the full financial year budget of 552.5 we're forecasting a spender for 90. so performance today in our future month forecast for this financial year you'll see that january and february spend was lower than forecast by around about 14 million so this does require a delivery units to recover that spend in future months as well as months if you refer to the summary page on page 41 delivery units have confirmed that they will be able to recover that spend so eight point five million of that uh was for transport rather it was in transport and that is work that has been completed uh but is not yet built so it will end into the system uh in future months and 3.8 million of that was actually a negative spend it was just a transferable land purchase into three waters and three waters we'll be spending that uh forecasting to spend that this financial year based on the discussions that we had at last committee you'll now see the detail relating to future month forecasts by delivery unit on pages 46 to 48 so this is in a different format than you've seen before so on the left of those pages you'll see the current month forecast and then the forecast per delivery unit that makes up that full month forecast and within that there is detail around what makes up that delivery unit forecast that's good so I'll uh then I'll be asking our delivery units to come up and speak to uh what specifically they are doing within those months to deliver on those forecasts so in terms of general comments as per last month our core program is still forecasting a bring back which is a unique position which means that against our core program uh we're still able to accommodate some unforeseen issues in the final months of the year across council we remain an improved position for projects in construction uh and so construction is where we do see the majority of spend so we would want to see a lot of projects in construction so we have 300 this year which is forecasting a remaining spend of 147 million and that compares to last year where we had 230 so 70 less forecasting a remaining spend of 118 million so that means we've got 29 million dollars worth of projects that are in construction that we didn't have this time last year and so last year our performance against that forecast in march of 118 was 80 despite covered a better result than we did last year in terms of delivery units um transport's in an improved position so they've got 57 projects in construction forecasting 50 million versus 36 last year forecasting 35 and three waters were in a similar position with 97 projects in construction forecasting 40 million I'll let them talk a little bit more about their units shortly forecast accuracy given the less spend in january and february uh than forecast uh is at 80 which is still a reasonably good forecast accuracy but if we were to model that out this financial year would end up with a result of around 321 million spend against the core program which is around a 14 carry forward so that's just on forecast accuracy alone though um so I'll invite the delivery units um to come up and talk specifically around their plan to deliver to the end of financial year starting with three waters um so john are you able to come up three waters has seen a spent today of 74. they've got a remaining spend of 90 million but I'll let john speak to that if you want to refer to pages 46 and 48 you'll be able to see the detail that these delivery units will be speaking to I don't have a great deal to add than I did from our last finance and performance meeting where I gave confidence that we were going to meet our delivery targets I'm just to add that that confidence does reduce in time as the closer we get to the end of the financial year and some of the issues that we're experiencing are unexpected consent conditions on some of our larger projects in the land drainage area which we're endeavoring to resolve and some delays in getting procurement completed through post-tender clarifications and closing out tags apart from that we are still in negotiations with the la one large land purchase of about six million dollars which needs to be finalized everything else is pretty much as I um stated last meeting all right thank you um transport let's take the presentation from all of the um areas from all of bring staff back to the table to answer those at the time I haven't got very much maybe richard needs to do it for the comedy venue um similar to three waters we we haven't changed a lot since last month however we have a lot transport has a lot of projects in contract a large number of mcrs dyes pass road is underway and martian's road bridge are the big ones sorry and that is largely what is giving us the confidence on the spend we also have a number that uh have closed tenders that have short construction periods and are about to start including cashmere her name firstly yeah thanks all right she just missed it can you repeat it it's about cashmere's about we thought your ears might have pricked up at that point that's all good all right thank you and then finally it's the major facilities so cmua and metro I see aleister's not in the room but I can speak to metro as you know it's a third party delivered project the forecasts receive from them so we don't have any control over those forecasts and then I understand you're getting a cmua update later so all right I'll just make some few more final comments just around the watch list um you'll note that two of our transport projects are now in handover enclosure so the hereford street and victoria street um great successful projects there instant auburn's community centre also practical completion this month with the opening next month early april and then you'll see that you've got a new report this month so instead of providing delivery completes from the previous period you'll now see what we've been able to achieve for the whole financial year um so there's a considerable effort to get all of those projects delivered to date this financial year so we'll keep that updated kind of rolling forward for the financial year so happy to take any questions now thanks all right thank you so a first look at the table on um on the graph um on page 45 um you know we we've got some very ambitious forecasts that obviously we're hearing that we are expecting to deliver to over the next four months what we've just heard from delivery units you know is really reinforcing that high level of confidence and that's good for us to hear and can I also say that the format of the report where we are now breaking this down by delivery unit makes it far easier to understand and to have confidence in the information that's been presented so so thank you for that but at a high level um really and I think we've got this right you are confirming a high level of confidence around delivery of what are really some quite ambitious targets over the next four months yeah I think like if you look at how we were doing last year um our spend today if we had delivered on january and february would be about the same and as you know we moved out and you'll plan a value down budget down to reflect our previous year delivery and our delivery units are was work completed not built and so if we are able to do that we are on track to deliver excellent and then on metro sports um obviously this is um the snapshot of where we were at in february when this report was put together no further update on that the information that we've got here is the most current alistar's here I do but I believe sorry I'm russian um john bridgeman's due to address council uh shortly so he's the invite has been sent and he's received and he's coming in to talk to the metro sports specifically regarding the questions that have been raised here yep all right there was a big article in the newspaper about it being delayed yeah can we just clarify whether that's existing information that we're aware of or whether that's new information the delay has always been uh noted it's been and the covered environments created that delay so it's just it's the extent of that delay has not been publicly notified and that's why john we'll wait for john to come in and we'll have that conversation at that time I apologize but I think I'm pretty sure it's the 29th I think which yeah if we can make sure that that's in people's calendars so that we get good attendance of that meeting that would be great thank you all right so that's everything from me are there any other questions on this um report jimmy yeah also on page 44 yeah but at least a major sports facility today due to the other kind of kobe 19 whether the contractor requests the the the coast from the council or not because because due to the shutdown you know this further delay yeah the negotiations around the covert variations for metro sport are undertaken by our third party so we don't have visibility of that okay thank you second one is on page the 66 the major cycle route south express the section two the completion date I'm not sure because we start from the section three section two section one so whether the same by december 21 because now it's almost go to the uh 1010 the tender process mri emit 66 page second two september 21 as I understand it through you mr chair that's consistent with what we've reported previously so nothing's changed still I said still okay but why you need to take so long so long time before you go to the tender you need to take another one and a half years just complete but but it is the section one you have not yet go to tender just detailed design but you can complete by the april 22. that's the planning day if we can deliver it earlier we will quite quite unreasonable I just confused I'm reasonable so that's no change jimmy has been noted from um previous information that we've had on this yeah because use section one you have now yet attended just detailed design you can complete it by the april 22 but the section two now you almost will go to the tender why you still need to take on december 22. it's not with what we've reported previously and it's it's simply the planning date so look as we get closer to that that might change and we'll update you accordingly thank you okay thank you all right thank you any further questions on the report yanny um page 63 my my favorite the littlest harbour wastewater scheme has now turned to amber you say ground conditions and contractual which is to be resolved design changes requiring significant input from council staff slowing down construction fronts uh I mean the poor residents of el port place they've literally had a decade of repairs and works in their little street for 10 years and this project um is still showing a risk does can can anyone tell me what the actual risks are and what the yeah what the time frame is for resolving them and if there's anything I'll just keep repeating if there's any sort of enhancement that we can do as a temporary or transitional measure to try and give those residents some some something to feel good about rather than just having through the chair we don't have the right people in the room for that right now so I'm happy to can we find out yeah provide us some information yeah it doesn't join as I understand it the only risk on that project is related to budget and that is being resolved through a change request and that is yet to be determined whether it is um there is a risk to budget um we're just flagging it at this stage so everything else I understand is on target and what you have highlighted in terms of some ground conditions is probably just reflective of why that's a risk to budget is there any scope within the project actually tidy up the end of the street that's basically being used at a work site you're talking about all port places um I'll I'll take that up with the project manager and see what we can do with it yeah just some nice plantings or something just to kind of return it to some sort of state rather than just doesn't look at that yeah okay that would be really cool um the other thing the question I had was in regards to um is the furry road master plan on track because I know there's two different projects going on there but it does seem very slow we had a community drop-in session um that was scheduled and I don't think staff thought that the work would be outside of where the drop-in session was but it was still there so it's showing here that it's all on track but I just wanted to get confirmation and I know that there's a wastewater and to the dates and the watch list my understanding is there's been an update to the board recently so have you had as would have had a memo recently I'll follow that up because it's true to go out to the board but it will be done by the june date yes so the work's progressing as expected yeah okay that's thank you um and just um just just finally just interested in the um waitaki because of contamination issues um sorry I'm just trying to find the page um okay I can't find it but it's the one um that's got it's said that it's been delayed because of significant contamination issues and I'm just wondering why we didn't know about that when we approved it because I'm sure that there were people in this room that had some sense of the site not being ideal or maybe yeah just struck me as unusual I understand it'll just that is a matter of just following standard project management procedure um before we start on a project we have to have approval to proceed and then after that we get into our investigations and our detailed site investigations and it's probably not until that time that we find that there's contamination and have to take account of it do we know what sort of contamination is there um I don't specifically but I'm guessing there's probably a bit of asbestos there um I doubt that there's um hydrocarbons or anything valley and then possibly some additional expense and consenting right okay all right thank you in the absence of mike I think you just got a question on the the northern line cycleway have you got a page number for that one 65. thank you um thanks I noticed since the last the watch list that the line for the five rail crossings has been removed which had a expected delivery date of june 22nd and now there's obviously a number also that have of sections have been pushed out to uh december 22 from a range of dates from june and october 22. I'd just like to get some information on when we're expecting to see those rail crossings actually delivered and has there been a delay in them there hasn't been a delay we're still working through them with key rail and finalizing the dates so okay this is improving the information that we knew on last month so the crossings have all been incorporated within the sections so from the information you know now when would you expect to see the crossings initially thought because of the requirements to get um gates and things we are looking to put temporary measures in to make it better okay so december 22nd this is the best this is the best and there's nothing we can do to we are working positively with carol at the moment yeah so we're getting some of them done historics barns and others are being pushed forward we are struggling with keyword in linkedin's but we are working on them um council davidson you will recall we actually read this specifically with the minister and then hence we did see an improvement in the situation it is still moving forward positively yes but I have a new report that has the date pushed out and I don't see that moving forward positively I see that delay there's a delay sorry and we have as you're aware this two intersections actually are an accident waiting to happen um and I'm extremely concerned about the length of time that this project has taken to be completed when we have money government money and I have said to lynette any other problems that you can you could you please come and tell us so that we can raise it again to keep putting the pressure back on if we're not seeing a shift thank you all right so we've got a recommendation in front of us to receive the information in the reports I'm happy to move that jimmy you're second all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you all right so now we'll move to item nine the council control organizations draft statements of intent and linda and len welcome to the table so these are civic building lgfa rickett and bus trust and rod donald banks peninsula trust um any commentary on these um just by way of kicking this one off that do you want to do the drafty surprise first so we've got the um sorry item nine yes the draft soi is yes please yep so we'll do the draft sois first and then item 10 is the half yearly reports for the same organizations so these are the and bush trust rob donald banks peninsula trust the general view our general view is that there could be some improvements made in the drafting um of these strategic objectives nature and scope of operations and performance measures but they are we can we can talk to each of the uh trusts uh the two trusts and civic building about those um prior to the finalization uh the as an aside the draft sois for cchl c and z and v base will come to finance and performance on the 29th of april after workshops transwaste soi has been received and will go to the joint committee in april no no draft sois have been received for central plains water trust or the samua project um central plains war trust has been given an extension and we have no knowledge of what's where these similar draft disarray is uh the draft sli is to the extent there are still covert implications that weren't uh expected last year the draft sois have updated for that the key the key covert impact is a general view that borders won't bosch trust in terms of tours and the cafe uh lgfa potentially more pressure on borrowing from local councils and that is the it's about the sum of it I'm happy to take questions all right thank you so um just noting that um resolution two that really picks up the feedback that you'll be giving around the specifics and the the clear strategic objectives and I think it's good that we've got that there um that obviously gives you the ability to go back and do that in each case which is good so moving to questions yawning thanks um in the rickerton bush uh draft statement of intent I know that um the goal four is to increase visitation but when you go through to the uh performance targets um it I may have missed it but I don't see any target around no so the target's been removed for this period while the the borders are closed their ability to increase visitation is severely impacted by that right so I've noted in the report that we will make sure of business as usual that that performance target will come back in again I guess from my point of view I don't know how others feel but I think it is quite good to get visibility of it like obviously recognizing that we're in a different environment but it would still be good to track the trends around the statement of intent but they'll be tracking it anyway um but also like domestic visitation should be something that possibly should be being targeted and and maybe it is maybe it's not but I would have thought what we've seen around new zealand is there has been an increase in some sort of visitation for some tourist operators part of our feedback we can go back to our regular bush um and we'll talk to them about whether they record that domestic um talent and we'll see what they can do I mean it usually flows through when I talk about the variances and so usually I will comment on whether uh donations or it's in the annual report as well so it think it's a big ask but I just think um you know it may be that will be whether we can get something that's reasonable we don't want to put a target in that's unachievable but we'll work with them on that and are you able to um advise what the equity consists of is that just the valuation of the property yeah yeah purely mostly in the truck and the um the ranges around the bush all right thank you any further questions mike I'm just looking at the um soi for civic building and in its um performance target it has environmental and social performance targets but it doesn't actually have a social performance target it just has an environmental one and I would have thought that actually you know having an accessible building would be quite a good social target and I'm just wondering if we need to they need to have a look at actually putting a social target in there if they say they kind of have social targets we'll go back to the directors of you nothing else building whether we need to think about um what our statement of intent is or if we need to send them a letter of expectation I don't know if others had any concern about it but sorry can you just repeat that question for staff do you think there's anything we should be asking cbl to do differently in the upcoming year ah no no no we don't so we're happy with their performance yeah it's it's very narrow scope of works that they do it would be it's fairly straightforward in that sense yeah I mean was there something that you were wanting to raise young well I mean yeah I mean if you look at it um you know it just does seem like they're making good good money off the building but in terms of the statement of intent there's nothing that you're proposing as a change no I don't quite understand that the timing of these processes but yeah if people don't feel there's anything needed to be added fine right thank you jimmy yeah I declared comfort interest followers yeah we noted at the beginning of the meeting okay because we noted at the beginning of meeting there are a number of councillors who've got roles on these trusts and um boards and obviously you're one of those that's funny thank you it's noted all right so um we have got the recommendations in front of us do I have a mover for those mike and a seconder tim any discussion all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you so now we'll move to the half yearly reports for the same organizations uh I was I was planning to take these as read there's very little to say but I could run through quickly and just mention uh lgfa has the covet implications have come through as an increase in borrowing by councils sorry bearing in mind this is for the period one july to 31 december last year um and bush trust has had some benefit of no sorry has has reduced its third-party income uh from the cafe it's also affected domestically when the levels shift the restrictions on travel internally are put on rod donald banks peninsula trust has actually had an increase in domestic use of the rod donald hut um and its key variances relate to a land purchase that it's got underway and it's been raising income for that raising donations for that and that's all I've got all right thank you so tim's happy to move sarah you're happy to second were there any questions on this all right so these have been moved and seconded I put the motion all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you and then um item 11 civic financial services the statement of intent um so just noting the two resolutions that are in front of us particularly resolution two about some next steps there um linda was there any comment that you wanted to make on this uh yes I just wanted to um not so much talk about what's in the soi but to mention that civic financial services used to be an insurance statute which provided a governance framework as a result it was exempted from the cco provisions of the lga but in the meantime it's transitioned its business away from insurance and into funds management or administering funds kiwisaver funds for local authority employees the insurance act that it was subject to has been repealed and it's now got no governing legislation other than your general business legislation like our companies act as a result we don't get a draft soi we get a final soi so we don't get that opportunity to provide comments although it wouldn't stop us if we had them but as it's final they would if they didn't want to do it they wouldn't change their soi we've since I wrote this report we've had a letter from them saying which they send every year saying that their annual general meeting will be in june I think it is and we've got all councils have got until 18th of april to put any nominations up for board positions you might recall last year we put of members of the board had served very lengthy terms the board members this year that are up for um who are retiring by rotation and have put themselves up for re-election uh the chair tony marriott who's served 13 years and uh director john melville who's um who's served eight years uh a very lot a very long-serving director who had been on there for 16 years retired this year and the board has co-opted a new member and the problem there is that auckland and christchurch councils have between them 32 and the remainder of their shareholding is split between 73 small councils or other councils which makes it very difficult to and for them with such small holdings to be particularly incentivised vote against the status quo last year we put up our two candidates they weren't successful partly because auckland council had at a staff level uh agreed with our position that the board members had served sufficient time and the board needed to be refreshed but when it came to voting they didn't follow through uh potentially putting up two I think this is something we perhaps need to take offline um you know and something that we would then bring back by way is a proper report to the meeting if there was a decision for the committee to make um I'm interested rather than in the detail of what happened last year and discussing individuals um I'm particularly interested in the the timeline um so we've got the agm which happens in june uh it's all been junior yeah and we've always passed through we've always had resolutions for the agm brought to this meeting prior so that we've got um a proxy that we appoint so there'll be a report coming with all of that any considerations around directors is something that we could put into that report as well would the timelines work though no no at that point uh it'll be too late we've got a window between now and the 18th of april to to make any nominations and after that can only vote on what they have on their agenda all right but to this resolution in front of us today because we don't have information on that that's correct yeah so I think this is something we need to take offline and if there's something that needs to be brought back to somewhere for a decision prior to the 18th of april let's work out how we build that in okay all right but let's let's take that offline and bring it back in a proper paper with written information of whatever decisions we need to make at that time rather than just the verbal update that you're providing us now all right thank you um was there anything else linda that you wanted to comment on this um statement of intent all right thank you very much indeed sam and I don't know how other people feel but what wouldn't I wonder if we could just delegate to the mirror and deputy me the ability to make the nominations on our behalf delegate to who sorry the mayor and the deputy mayor yeah rather than bringing if you guys are happy with that's sensible it avoids having to come back for a decision and clear it's a disguise we need to have a proper discussion about it rather than um it just means yeah we can move and then the only other thing is we're gonna put a timeline in there I think we discussed earlier on point two I think diane had some wording that's right so we were just going to add there um within the next six months so if we can just build that into resolution two it just set some expectation around the um timing for that six six months six months yeah all right and then resolution three um linda this is just about the um director nominations you'll still be bringing the report that we normally get around appointing a proxy and deciding on any um resolutions so moved by sam seconded by um james daniels so I just had some questions yeah no I'll come back to questions I'm just want to get these resolutions sorted first and then I'll come back to any outstanding questions director nominations for the um annual general meeting um yeah delegate to the deputy mayor and deputy mayor decisions on director nominations for the upcoming annual general meeting yep that's fine linda that works doesn't it that's good yep all right fantastic so moved by um moved by sam macdonald and seconded by james daniels and we're not done with questions yet so yani I'll come back to you thanks um can can you just advise um what what sort of like just from reading this we're not getting dividends from them anymore so what's our shareholding worth value terms um we the only dividend of any note that we have received in the past was when they sold their building and we got a special dividend for that they've never been in a position to pay I mean there might have been small dividends um our shareholding we can't divest because there's nobody to buy it so what would happen if we just pull out it was still bound by the lap work that they've undertaken through um of activity in that space but as linda pointed out the key focus for them now is superannuation and the administration of the super easy schemes and they've chosen um as effective from last year that they see more benefit in retaining or reducing their profitability to support those reduced fees for all of those members right so that's how they see their their role as being an officer how many of our members or staff are actually members of that scheme like do we know what the benefit is actually to us for them reducing the fees but is there any advantage um only in so far that perhaps it will generate more demand for their scheme because they'll effectively be yeah the number we don't have of our staff being a participant a lot of the smaller councils are it's very attractive for those members um so therefore and auckland does have a very high proportion of membership to their schemes so our one we don't we're not sure l1 is high I did look for that information I just can at that last year because I was concerned about risk if we were recommending it but um we're going to include that in the paper that's coming out for the agm does that help I think well I think so like a moment of intent um I mean I'm getting positive commentary from um diane around um you know the supply of that service to this council and I think we need to remember that we're just one shareholder along with a number of other councils in an organization which is providing a service to a number of councils so for us to take a particularly christchurch-centric approach on this in the bigger picture um may not be the the best way forward but why don't we think about how we can deal with the matters that jan is raising um in terms of the preparation for the agm the paper that's coming because that's obviously where any resolutions for the agm would be detailed um rather than for the statement of intent and obviously the consideration around the delegation in item three organization to be doing in the next period as well yeah and I mean just reading these predictions like it's a tiny scheme 2.4 million dollars I mean they get 2.5 million dollars of revenue and that's 2.1 million of expenses like in the scheme of things it seems tiny it wouldn't take you know that many people to get those sorts of figures in across the country so so I mean again I'm not hearing you suggesting any change to the statement of intent there are obviously some matters of interest that may be better considered in terms of any resolutions for the agm rather than in regard to the statements of intent all right keen to move this on any um further questions all right so this is moved and seconded um I'll put the motion all those in favor say I against as carried thank you all right so now moving to the last item on our open agenda the christchurch city holdings half year report and paul thank you for joining us I invite you to come to the table and you some questions yeah thank you um very much andrew and steve ballard who I think most of you know is here as well if you ask any really difficult questions I'll get steve to answer those thank you um but look I'll take the report as read but I think just in summary um six months ago well nine months ago when we were forecasting at the back end of covet may june last year pretty uncertain environment pretty difficult to actually forecast what um that post covert period was going to look like pleasingly six months down the track it's been a lot stronger financially than what we thought particularly in relation to the most impacted part of our portfolio which was the airport so that domestic air travel market has been a lot more resilient than what we would have than what we did estimate actually back in june last year so that's the largest driver of the favorable returns relative to what we were expecting uh in that first half there's still a significant element of uncertainty there though um it performed a lot more um a lot stronger than what probably many commentators projected at the time but there's still that lingering uncertainty there in terms of border closures or border reopening rather the time frames around that are still uncertain and when borders reopen will they stay open and what's the impact and the flow through so there's those sort of issues in the travel context we've got similar challenges in a supply chain context which is impacting more broadly um some of it's linked to covet and some of it's linked to some of the disruptions in auckland um around being the major freight gateway for the sea sea freight so uh net net I think from council's point of view and cchl's point of view the the headline story is that um uh in june last year cchl forecasted dividend to council of 18 million we revised that up to 34 million in december last year as you were going through your ltp process um as we sit here today we remain confident that we're on track to be a decision that the board will make in june and pay in june so that's probably all I had to provide as an overview happy to take any questions thank you are there any questions for paul aaron yeah just on some of the global freight stuff paul um I believe the air freight hasn't changed much in price and the delivery mechanisms have stayed about the same so they're performing really well sea freight on the other hand has gone up 400 as an and is incredibly slow have you feedback from the port company why that is because that will be affecting our exporters our construction I mean just every industry possible yeah I haven't had feedback on the pricing error I'm not aware of the 400 stat um in terms of time frames though you're right there are challenges around freight movements in and out of new zealand um a lot of those are linked to auckland because auckland has been disrupted because they've got an automation project a widely publicised automation project in auckland to automate a lot challenge and that has caused significant disruption in auckland which is cascaded through the rest of the network because a lot of what comes into auckland is either coastal shipped or road or rail transferred throughout the rest of the country and the coastal shipping network has been disrupted because of the disruptions in auckland so that has caused timing challenges for importers and exporters and is was there any opportunity for like littleton port to grab some ground off auckland through that yep yep not of auckland necessarily but um I think it's is it public around musk uh I don't know if it's public or not but they've certainly taken some opportunity haven't they to increase their profile yeah I mean lpcr capturing some market share we can talk a little bit more openly in px around that but um the answer is yes but not from auckland more from um more adjacent ports right okay yeah because obviously northland took that opportunity at one point she had some wins and losses but yeah yeah okay england auckland and tauranga tend to compete zealand's a two-hub country a south island hub and a north island hub the north island hub logically is either tauranga or auckland and that's the shipping lines make those choices and as do the importers and exporters um lpc is logically you know the main south island hub but there are other options and the coastal shipping network's going to link to that hub so cool thank you all right thank you so I've got jimmy phil and then yarny I just want to clarify mr figure I mean compared to the last year's the first half the net income a net profit reduced almost about uh the uh 20 million dollars however the total operating revenue reduced for uh 42 million dollars there is a gap for the 20 million dollars and also 42 million dollars I just want to know accept the tax you know who else this this this cape 42 and these are 20._``_5424.4 so the revenues down 42. I haven't got the same page number references jimmy I'm sorry then you have but the question was the 20 million 10 million that's your question yeah yeah that question and as your questions accept the tax tax who else uh well the other difference would be operate operating costs yeah yeah yeah operating costs yeah so I mean that's a consolidated figure though so it's a it's a an addition of effectively the eight subsidiary companies so there's a number of moving parts uh and there there's probably 20 or 30 different things going on there to actually fully answer your question okay okay thank you thank you film yeah thanks paul um I think you have been quite um nice to auckland saying it was challenging the word disaster would be a lot better I'm just asking a question lpcs not as far as you know aren't looking to have an automated system and run down that lpc good question lpc is watching with interest you know at some point that is an option uh it's on their radar they're not about to press go on it they're watching with interest and learning from what auckland follow suit apart from the loss of money and well we have ships coming in and out and stuff just clagged up in auckland it's hopeless um all because of that system yeah you've only got to go to auckland you can see there's there's 10 or 15 vessels yeah sitting out there just moored for days okay we're just waiting to see that happen down here no and it's not happening down here um but despite not happening down here there are some challenges because we've had vessels in it at lpc birthed that have got a slot to get into auckland on their way out or on their way back that means they can't spend the amount of time they've needed to spend here to actually unload everything so there's been cargo that's come into port has remained on the vessel it hasn't been able to be unloaded because I've got to go to get the slot in sydney or get the slot in auckland and then they've had to come back so you been vehicles you know vehicle movements that have actually been into port but haven't got off the boat until the second time around those are the sort of things that are happening all the time unfortunately which we can't control yeah all right thank you yani um I'm struggling to understand why both enable and orion are such um major sponsors of the chamber of commerce like they're monopolies I can't see what benefit it is for them to be involved in a sort of lobby organisation um I think they see themselves as corporate citizens of of canterbury um and supporting uh organizations uh like the two you mentioned there are key stakeholders in our community and our corporate community um they see supporting those and aligning themselves with those organizations as being consistent with their broader objectives in a commercial context do you find it sort of like okay that they would support an organization that wants us to sell off our assets no I mean I mean so I mean the first question is valid and I think the answer is pretty a reasonable question for a six monthly report um I mean the the reason strategically why our companies would want to have a relationship with others in the business community I think the answer is pretty obvious but it's a valid question um the second question I don't think is a a reasonable question for the six monthly report at all so but they're part of the organization that make submissions to us during the ltp why wouldn't they be neutral all right so okay the other thing is um can can I just get a sense of what's happening as part of a letter of expectation we expected that we get a report at least six monthly on progress of achieving remuneration expectations across the group and in implementing the living wage can you give us I was quite concerned for example that the orion ceo salary remuneration wasn't disclosed but can you give us some sense of what's been happening with our expectations across the remuneration and also the living wage yeah what the trends are any you know I think would be welcome but I mean obviously I'll leave that for you to respond so there's a workshop um next week next tuesday to cover uh all of that so that's the appropriate forum to work through that why can't so what what are we workshopping every aspect of the question you just asked but this is like a month this is a the six monthly report yeah so we can't get any sense now what what's this there's a package of information that we've got that addresses that that's not before you today and it's not in front of me today either but I think we can have a much more informed discussion if we can allow if you can allow us to take you through um a package of information that sets all of that out which we're preparing for the workshop next tuesday will that be public no the workshop won't be public is there anything that we can say publicly about what's been happening well let's discuss that at the workshop on've also got the statements of intent coming back obviously given the discussion that happened around the letter of expectation I imagine that some of the matters that you're talking about will come into play around the statements of intent discussion which is why the workshop prior to that is important but the comments in the media for example when new ceos are appointed and we refuse to release how much they're getting paid just looks bad right and that's public so I can't understand why we shouldn't be able at least to show what the general trends are in terms of our performance monitoring let's as paula mean the living wage has got huge public interest yeah as does ceo remuneration so let's get the information which is the important part that's what we want that's what we need that's what we expect that's what we said that we expect if paul's um electing to bring that to us by way of a workshop and that's the best forum to present that information then that works and when the information that's presented at the workshop and to what extent that becomes public will be something that is absolutely on the table for discussion at the workshop um including the specific matters that you've raised but let's um let's have the workshop and see what's been presented and then once we've got that information we're in a far better position to discuss how we want to handle it but I don't doubt and looking at the um public discussion that happened around the letter of expectation that some of the matters that you've raised will come into the discussion for the um statement of attention of intent as well so getting the timing and sequencing of this right and getting the correct and full information will be vital in terms of um the development of the soi yep thanks andrew nothing further paul you wanted to add on that no like I'm really looking forward to the workshop discussion I think we've got a couple of hours set aside and I think that's a much right information in front of everybody so we're speaking the same language yeah I mean what we're hearing today is that there's a you know degree of interest a strong degree of interest in matters that um we're going to be discussing at that workshop um let's have the workshop and you know at that time we can work out where we go from there with that information may well be the statement of intent discussion is where much of it lands and the workshops that are linked to that andrew are exactly right correct um yeah and we that's what we agreed we would do that was my understanding yeah yeah absolutely all right moving on to further questions um aaron yeah sorry should I asked her before so just around the uh airport um and uh under the in the red there is the tasman and pacific islands uh passenger numbers and uh also international passenger volumes they're all um obviously in red but the comment has no expectation of a tasman bubble in fy 21 and no expectation of a well that was the view at 31 december um if we updated it um a month ago it might have been the same if we updated it even a week ago it might have been the same if we updated it earlier this week it might have changed but we're going to find out on the 6th of april I believe it's a really difficult difficult one to call yes and even if we have certainty around a time frame to open up a trans tasman bubble how that then plays out is inherently uncertain as well yeah so from uh speaking to some of the staff there that obviously they're ready to go and they have plans if it happens but we've been ready to go since october last year yeah but from the government's perspective have we heard whether all the bubbles are in and out of auckland only or are they talking will christchurch in the south island be in the conversation I'm led to believe it's definitely a national um so they're effectively thinking about new zealand think about it that way so it'll be a state-by-state bubble from new zealand into different states of australia that won't be auckland-centric um the intentions if you look at the websites of the airlines who are taking forward bookings um they are taking bookings in and out of christchurch and auckland so definitely christchurch is well positioned cool thank you any further questions all right so um we uh we've got a resolution in front of us to um note the reports do I have a mover for that tim seconded by pauline discussion yep yani um so I was just a little bit concerned around some of the information in the report that two of our companies are major sponsors of the chamber of commerce who submitted that cchl be directed to provide council with advice on how to repackage its investments to maintain services for christchurch while releasing capital for new investments and I mean I just find it a little bit ironic really that there's this kind of um advocacy and lobbying which I welcome from the chamber that they're entitled me that there is a bit of a conflict of interest issue happening here where you've got major funders who we own then paying an organization to come and criticize us it seems a bit weird so I mean you know it's no criticism of the chamber I understand the role that they play in the city but I just wonder um how we're kind of measuring the value of what we're getting from that from our companies and whether cchl needs to have some sort of policy around that so you know I welcome the information in the report I do think we need to start thinking about um the remuneration and living wage in a transparent way and although I welcome the workshop the reality is that this huge public interest in terms of what's happening with living wage and senior executive remuneration and I think we should be as open and transparent as possible when it comes to discussing that so that the public can see what's going on so I'm happy to receive the report I obviously um I my concerns around around that but I would encourage you to read the submissions from the chamber to past annual and ltps and to reflect on whether it's appropriate that we're that our companies are funding criticism of ourselves or whether there's a better use of that money um coming back to the right place thank you tim thank you and I think it's actually a really good thing that our companies are involved with the chamber of commerce they do a hell of a lot for the business in christchurch um I don't think we've got to the stage where we blacklist people organizations that have a different view than we do and I think that if we got to that stage none of us would be sitting here we'd probably be in a jail somewhere so I think it's excellent that we're involved in it the training that the um the um chamber of commerce do throughout all businesses of all sizes is absolutely exceptional and is a backbone to the industry in christchurch in canterbury so I'm sarah I'll just add that you know companies like citycare help sponsor student volunteer army and those kind of projects and yeah when it was received we were told that we were we were told in the informal letters because it was just receiving it was okay yeah yeah the advice that we'd given was that um that's the case is there any further discussion on this report no all right so this has been moved and seconded I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that's carried all right so now if we can move to the resolution to exclude the public um and paul we are inviting you to remain after the public have been excluded for item 15 um because of knowledge that's relevant to that item will assist the council um I'm happy to move the resolution to exclude the public do I have a second sam mcdonald um all those in favor say aye against that's all right so we'll just wait for him you
Thank you there's no deputations by appointment and no uh petitions uh so we'll move to item seven uh 2021 after our bike challenge and so the 2021 rtro bike challenge uh it's been a great event where people and organizations across new zealand compete in teams to earn points for kilometres written days were in a number of people
That's carried all right so now if we can move to the resolution to exclude the public um and paul we are inviting you to remain after the public have been excluded for item 15 um because of knowledge that's relevant to that I'm going to assist the council um I'm happy to move the resolution to exclude the public do I have a second sam mcdonald um all those in favor say aye against karen all right so we'll just wait for you
I'm assuming there are none uh confirmation of minutes from 10th of march moved jake second pauline all those in favor we have one public forum from chris baxter welcome chris I have five minutes um um um a bit of background for me I'm a member of the inner city east lynnwood revitalization committee and also a member of the greening the east so what we're proposing here is a temporary cycle way in order to get it in part of the into the green corridor and the linwood village street street escaping so the greening the east project one of the main focuses is a green corridor between the linwood shops and the red zone um as you can see on the list on the um on the left here um and there's also there's a streetscaping project along the lingerie south so those are both coming up hopefully in the long term plan um but neither of them at this stage have a cycleway component so what we'd like to do is get a temporary cycleway in place before that happens um so why do we need it here what we're saying I'm too far um so the green in the east has sort of identified stanley road is a pretty important link between um the linwood village and the avon corridor and as you can see from that photo it's not that nice to walk up and down or cycle up and down at the moment so it's pretty important to get that link there to get people from the linwood village to use the um the red zone and also to allow people that are using that red zone for recreation running cycling dog walking etc to get up into malinois village and hopefully buy a coffee to cafe and do other shopping there um so it's got a few other photos there's sort of what it looks like at the moment so there is an existing cycle way going from the retrominding end of stanley road up to the bridge so it's proposing extending that as well um um so that sort of influence that um sort of um connection there of of potentially pushing that further forward up to the um up to the um phillipstown hub um but yeah so what we're posing at this stage is try to get it on the plan because it's going to save money getting it at this stage rather than just sort of adding it later um it'll make it better because we can get it into the design rather than just attacking it onto the side that's pretty much me thank you chris do you want to add anything michelle uh just to um just to reiterate that what chris is saying in terms of the importance of with the streetscape work happening that that there is uh it enables activation the cycle way this linkage with the red zone because there are a lot of people that are using the red zone and coming and going from other parts of town really keen to have a way to bring them down into their into linwood village particularly once the streetscape's done and also just that this is a prime time for it to happen excellent you talk about cycle lanes are you actually referring to the cycle ways you're referring to cycle lanes or separated cycle well because it's going to be design process for um the green corridor and the streetscaping I'd like to not be overly prescriptive and what we actually propose and lead it up to the designers of those two projects just make sure they have some form of cycle infrastructure okay excellent um we've got time for another question if someone has a question yeah sorry is there an actual project for upgrading yes yeah so that's that's the that's part of the um the urgency if you will is to to to that we use that project it would be more efficient to do it while that project's taking place so this one's talking about the stand more along stanmore road between the um the streetscape is yep no that's that's fine and I'll cut you off there because it hit the five minute but I've got a resolution there just to make sure this doesn the right people and it definitely can be considered amongst that wider work and local connections that have been done but thank you very much for your time cheers jake do you want to move that special you only happen to second it confused about it um I just I think we do need to make sure that's actually get the information on the project as well yeah because we just had the greening the yeah um corridor thing at our board yesterday and a lot of stuff was considered out of scope and this is like you know important so it'd be good to get it included but we do need a bit of understanding about what the actual project is and what the scope is yeah thank you all right all those in favor thank you
Appointment there are none today and presentation of petitions there are none today so that then um sees us moving to item seven the performance exceptions report um so I'd welcome peter ryan to the table peter um good morning thank you if there are any remarks that you'd like to make on this report we'll take it as read and then we'll move to questions thank you and good morning um no there are no real detailed remarks to make uh the levels of service and to some extent the capital project's results are extremely consistent with the last five months uh they're probably uh a fair indication of where we will land at year end and there isn't really much else to report uh the the level of service results in particular have been stable for the last five months in a row they're not varying less than one percent so they're very stable position uh much of what remains will depend on the resident survey results and we've undertaken to give you a rough and early look year and presenting a polished result in may when it's a little bit too late to do anything but the remaining results will often hinge on that on those surveys the other more objective results uh to some extent were affected by uh process issues around covert so there is that factor there as well but by and large we're fairly consistent with previous years within a few percent of the organizational target and very stable excellent thank you very much so just a couple of questions on the um residence survey results if I can so I'm good to hear that um once you've got those results and have an opportunity to have a look at them we'll be getting an early heads up on um what they look like when will the when will this report be updated with those results I would hope next month's report would contain those preliminary results um we would normally only have the package of results to you in early may yep but the raw data so putting aside pretty graphs and and presentation the raw now we just opened reporting yesterday um so I do need to talk to some people about exactly what percentage of that data will be available over the next week but I believe that most of it will be and we should be able to give it directly to the managers now there is the issue I should canvas here that if it appears in next month's report uh that data will go will be public at that point just so we can't we can't report it without it becoming of course yeah of course and chair you will appreciate I haven't seen any of it yet myself yeah absolutely all right so let's see lt so let's keep a good joined up approach to this yes and expect there'll be at the very least some update next month um possibly the report updated certainly the report updated in may the following month um yeah let's just keep a good joined up approach to that I mean the important thing is that once the information is available and has been considered the from our point of view of course is that that's something we'd be taking into account as part of our long-term plan um considerations alongside the community feedback that we're getting through the consultation period at the moment as well of course all right so thank you for that update um let's move on to any further questions on this report are there any questions jimmy question on pages 32 regarding to a pax and a full shield the target hundred percent customer service request numbers age 66 percent but you're answering here due to the closure of several out of date historical uh customer service request numbers I can't understand what I mean I can't really speak for andrew in detail here but I think what he's saying is that there have been historically some csrs that were held up and that in resolving them and coming to a final statistic that it's come out at 66 percent okay but I think probably this one if you close should be the percentage it should be high rather than rather than second question is on page 35 regarding citizen and the customer service delivery time target is 90 seconds one half minutes but year to date is more than two minutes but here particular mentioned starving constraints have been our biggest hurdle in recent weeks let's show that our staff in our right shoulder task force or I think it can be taken at face value that they have been short of staff and that they do have people about to commence to address that so the uh but it's a two uh more than two minutes that's a particular is average only average yes an average speed to answer yes okay thank you thank you mike um page 22. actually I've probably potentially asked this one in the next one the the exceptions around the major cycleway should I just save that for the for the next item um potentially yes because this is the okay that's fine anything else on this report yawning thanks um just on the measure more people are choosing to travel by bus which page um that's on page any information about the success or otherwise of the real-time information system um I have put questions in the office the ca to try and understand the extent of the failure of that system for buses um and I think we were going to get something back and I know we're looking at a new system we had a youth advisory meeting a few weeks ago where we've got a youth action plan from 2017 which one of the actions is to fix the real-time information on the buses so I guess it's just a question around the remedial action um because we're not getting more people choosing to go by bus we're not meeting our target um and I just wonder whether we're making any steps to improve people's understanding of how the system works given it's been an issue that's been raised I'm just not comfortable with the lack of detail in the remedial action when some very obvious things seem to be at play that could be done um through you mr chair we are putting in I haven't got an exact date for when that will be delivered but obviously we need to work closely with environment canterbury on that because um as I think I mentioned last time they have to go at specific bus stops they have to be on the buses and they have to also be at the bus interchange so all three components need to speak to each other so we're in the middle of kind of rolling that out now um and I expect it it certainly will be in this year um but I can't give an exact date on when that will be done because the thing that people keep saying to me is if the real-time information system is incorrect and inaccurate it's a real deterrent it would be better to turn it off and not have incorrect information been given for people so that they just wait for the bus but is there any sort of understanding about the extent of the problem with the current real-time information system and what steps are being taken to ensure that when people want to when it's coming or they don't get the inaccurate information so you know I've had several people raise this concern with me and I just I'm not clear like why our response would be to continue to use a system that's not working if that's indeed the case so it's not that the system is is not working completely but it certainly is past its use by date hence the reason why we're replacing it but it is still preferable from our perspective to keep it going because it does have benefits and it is important um but yeah it's not perfect and hence the reason why it's been replaced so to add to that if we're in a replacement mode when that is completed it is clearly important that there is very good communication to the public to tell them that there is something new in place and that they can rely on the information that is there otherwise they will have a view that they can't necessarily trust it I i get that but the feedback trying to catch the bus is they keep getting the wrong information they keep getting told the bus is coming 20 minutes later when it actually comes in a minute or two minutes time so we've improved the frequency along like ferry road and yet the real-time information is still giving people very very wrong information but I don't I don't know the extent of the problem but what people are saying to me is they'd rather not be given incorrect information then then you know then and then not just kind of expect the bus to come then be told it's coming 20 minutes later to have it was passed while they're going to go do something else in terms of the real-time existing real-time information system um like I said there is issues with it it's not perfect hence the reason why we are replacing it but it but it's in our view the benefits of keeping it in place until we put the new system in outweigh the cost of having some of it not working as we'd executive's point is there any communications that we can give to the community to help them understand that it's not working on areas where it's broken because I don't have any sense of the problem or where exactly it's not not working versus where it is the the intention is to um once we roll out the new system is to have a community we have a communications plan around that and people will be made aware of it once it's implemented um but it's not um as simple as simply saying some parts of it don't work as well as others so it's it's I don't know whether that's possible to put something out there to say some parts of the system don't work I would suggest that that's likely to result in miscommunication and misunderstanding of the system and would probably cause more damage than it solves your problem is with it the actual problem is that the system has become redundant and needs replaced and hence the reason why we're replacing it that's the reason why we're replacing it it's it's not perfect we've reported that it hasn't been perfect for a long period of time um we've sent numerous memos to councillors on it um so it's it's not news um and that's the reason why we're replacing it and we've got funding in the ltp to do that so um so you're anticipating it will be completed in this financial year um maybe not this financial year um through you mr chair but but not too far after that is my understanding but I can't give you an exact date at the moment but I my understanding is will be q3 can we get an update on that I mean clearly there's some urgency around it I mean yanny's point about incorrect information been provided I guess there's a question as to whether incorrect information is better than no information at all or not um the important thing is if we know there's a problem there's funds on budget or there it that we prioritize this and get it done as soon as possible and so we can get a memo around those timelines and just to give some feedback it seems like with the new scheduling when the frequency was increased that's what's created the problem so you know we've got buses going I think it's every 10 minutes up the main roads now okay um I mean we've been told that we've got a system that isn't working and it needs to be replaced um what we need to know is when that replacement is going to happen okay further questions pauline yep sure what page um on page 25 just with the leakage rate it doesn't seem to be coming down at all and we've actually we have as far as I know been putting in some remediation for instance prioritizing the leakages and getting out there much quicker and getting on top of the we've been told getting on top of that leakage so why isn't that figure changing or is this sort of slightly older hi um it's it's not likely to change um greatly for about five years because we have a five-year rolling program of doing leak detection throughout the city um so it's it's a difficult one and we're not going to see an instantaneous response to our leakage rate with an instantaneous replacement of a pipe because we don't measure a pipe by pipe we measure it zone by zone so is it more a matter of data recording or is it actual are you saying the leakage is being slowed but the data's showing us it's not we're saying that the renewal program will significantly improve the leakage rate yes but the methodology we use to measure it doesn't reflect that instantaneously oh that's a bit concerning isn't it because it's still certain this is this is something that will hopefully be um improved when we complete our smart water trial in the rafiti area so we'll have bulk water meters and instantaneous measurements of flows and that will give us a very good understanding of had that smart smart area and we then roll it out throughout the rest of the city depending on what the results of that are right so when you're expecting that to be finished that zone or the smoke oh very good question um it's part of a reform water reform package so it's probably about a year away and we've lit out we're letting our tenders for the supply of that um the instrumentations with that very soon so you're saying what you're saying is once you get the raffiti trial done you could transfer that expectation into another zone if you've done the same we could do if the council chooses to fund that through the ltp right okay thank you thanks john thank you are there any further questions that people want to raise on this all right so I'm happy to move that we received the information provided in the report pauline you were second all those in favor say I against that's carried so now let's move to item
Thank you I have a number of apologies uh from councillor chuang goff for lateness uh councillor galloway for early departure and counselor major for absence um do I have someone to move them aaron seconded by sarah all those in favor okay I'm unaware of any declarations of interest so I'm assuming there are none
All right karen uh public forum first up we have uh david duffy's going to speak to propose new richmond cycle safety routes welcome david now just so you're aware you have five minutes and that'll include any questions is there a magic toy here the mouse right okay thanks for the opportunity to come and speak about our cycle safety route proposal this has come about as we have um ongoing concern about the safety of children and other road users in richmond and brought about by a careful watching of the current cycle lanes that are marked on the roads uh which they're on very busy commuter roads and there are a number of hazards presenting themselves which led us to look for a safer option we also are aware of the community well we've got community support through a number of questionnaires we've presented at local events and we're also aware too of the worldwide trend towards city improving city infrastructures which provide greater access for cyclists scooter riders and pedestrians the proposal the rationale behind it is um based transport options uh this route proposes to use quiet suburban streets which have no competing elements like large service trucks buses etc large streams of commuter traffic and cars and that kind of thing and we also want to align the program with the current north richmond road repair program so that when the streets which have not been repaired yet are designed for repair they can take into account the inclusion of this road safety this cycle safety element in them the route itself as you can see starts over at the palms or the shirley intermediate school corner and wins its way through along north parade where there is a current cycleway it then turns into aval street where it will serve the new banks avenue school which they turned the sod in the new site about two weeks ago and they're looking to be in residence in there around about mid late 2022 possibly 2023 so there'll be a an increased uh cycle flow for the younger generation through that area uh down to stapleton's road wins its way around through dudley street nickel program work in the new year through onto the streets that have been repaired including perth and alexandra and comes emerges out by fitzgerald ave the safety features considerations um I've mentioned before the commute of rush hour traffic the narrow channels the heavy traffic the inherent traffic changes such as opening car doors buses pulling and out of traffic etc and we're suggesting that by rerouting those cycle options and the utilization of appropriate signage and road markings the danger factor will be significantly reduced we've gone carefully over the proposed route to see what modifications might be necessary and we've listed them there upgrading of the cycle path existing already in north parade two sets of traffic lights in north parade to be retained the entrance to the school banks avenue school may need to incorporate some design features to increase the safety of the school pupils the design of available street may involve narrowing of the current carriageway the pedestrian safe safety crossing safety zone on north aven road at nicholls street may need to be redesigned that could be included in the passage across fitzgerald avenue at alexandra street that maybe need to install some kind of crossing facility but then overall we would like to see prominent signage installed and and I and this is um in line two or alongside a proposal from our association that the speed limit in the um quieter roads of richmond be reduced to 40 kilometers an hour in terms of a time frame we'd like to see it worked in with the current road rebuild program some of which has already been completed and so we're probably looking at a two to three year fully completion of this scheme thank you thank you just um it's brilliant just to clarify the if you put the map up just that little bit is that going down north parade or is it going inside the school fence no it's going down north parade on the current um there's a quite a wide footpath from the martians road corner through to the old entrance to shirley boys high right and that's off off road it's pretty wide all the way be wider than twice this disc yeah but it might be a good idea to look at seeing if you could put it on the inside of the fence along the schools because it's surely intermediate it doesn't go right up to the fence they're not using it but right now but the trees do I don't design it in the committee thank you really thank you very much it's great to have this type of deputation obviously we're going to be going into the consultation for the long term plan um so it'll be really important to submit um also within that we uh there's a I guess another program of work happening within our cycling infrastructure which will look at local connections as as well so we do have a resolution up there that I'll put in after all the public forums have been done just to make sure that we sort of look at some of these local connections that are being mentioned and actually how we're going to move them going forward thank you for your I have a second uh public forum from june pecker welcome june um I've come to talk about housing um and I'm hopeful that my neighbors and I can convince our council that what we're asking for is important and attainable given that it appears medium density housing is inevitable to some degree in our older suburbs I suggest we give up complaining and instead look at ways to make it more palatable than the two current examples at 138 and 47 mersey street in respect of these two developments it's obvious that what this developer is selling is acceptable to the kosher city council and its independent commissioners but we residents nearby are affected and we're mostly of the opposing view so I request that our council work with us towards a less polarizing and more aesthetically pleasing future on a walk around saint orbans and mirabelle recently my partner and I studied and took photos of a number of medium density blocks we imagined next door to our 100 year old bungalow and we rated them one pleasant two easy on the eye and we further discussed and analyzed home and we were surprised to find that there's not much between one and five that can't_''_556.24 be put right with changes to architectural features and some attention to the colour spectrum and a genuine concern for the amenity of the neighborhood that would include vegetation and we truly believe that it might be that easy wolfbrook designs in particular are almost all two-storied they're predominantly glaringly white with black window surrounds and rooves and sometimes dark stained usually upright wood panels this style originated in tutor times in england it's quite foreign to our established landscape it's designed to stand tall and draw attention in much the same way a stark wedding cake a big white thing in the middle of the table dominates that table there were only a few of these on our walk and they certainly did that they appeared incongruent in the extreme although our neighbouring our neighborhood housing comprises mainly single-story dwellings and our idea would be for new builds to follow suit it became obvious that um large in itself is not fact some of them from the 19th century even for instance nurse moored in the fitzroy and the salisbury foundation even these we could deem easy on the eye because of their presentation in fact 70 percent fell within our first three categories because of the color palette alone sympathetic creams and ivories with roofs and trims from the same spectrum of the color wheel these are in fact known as heritage colours suitable for older neighborhoods when accompanied by mature trees and lower paling fences as opposed to white concrete block walls and or those tall black slatted palisades this increased the visual amenities significantly we noted that horizontal weatherboard or linear board softens the impact of large two in an area of older and smaller we also noticed the predominant use of light green and or pale grey aluminium window framing that was eminently suited to our older leaving leafy neighborhood too the question most asked here and overseas currently in relation to the worldwide housing crisis is why do new builds have to look so ugly well they don't in our opinion our local knowledge is the sections and they will sell the 11 units for more than 600 000 each that's what they're advertised for so we find it hard to believe they would go to the wall if they were authoritatively required to claddin or significantly use horizontal weatherboard or linear or brick paneling on the street facing aspects in our older suburbs and if they were required to paint in colours sympathetic to the age and colouring of the existing housing in the area and if they were required to add features such as profiled windows trimmed in almost anything but black if they were required to design their developments around existing mature trees to immediately mitigate or ameliorate impact on neighbours do you have much left to know nearly finished and finally we would ask that the council requires developers to maintain the properties they buy between purchase date and demolition of starter building this could be as simple as mowing lawns and collecting mail the house next to us previously wayne payne all always well maintained has attracted much attention in the past six months because of its unkempt insecure a secure hazard exposed its owners haven't responded to polite requests to deal with this a similar property on innis road has been flooded vandalized I'm going to have to do two steps I'm going to have to stop you there because you're well over the five minutes okay but thank you for your time um and we appreciate you coming to speak on behalf of a number of saint auburn's residents who are concerned with this type of infill um obviously that is shared by a lot of people also around this council table and I guess it's potentially not going to get any better with the national policy statement on urban development which will encourage this type of activity and a lot of the communities that do have character areas aren't protected unless they're actually identified already within the district plan so it's not a it's not going to be an easy way to try and preserve some of that character as we move forward but we have done things in the past I know in november quality of our medium and high density dwellings and also I guess when staff when they developers go through the resource consent process staff do work with them to try and suggest ways that they can actually keep to the character of communities but ultimately it is with the developers for that end product but we are very aware of your concerns and we're trying to do our best to see how we can I guess mitigate some of the impacts of these developments into these communities but thank you for your time thank you anything else also I'd just like to note that um francine bills was wanting to do a public forum but she had already already presented to the community board but I'll circulate um after the meeting the letter that she'd put forward just so um other councillors are aware of what she wanted to say um our last public forum I'm not too sure if he's here is from chris baxter no he's not he's not here to present it there is a powerpoint on on the at it so I've just got a resolution up there can we just put in some correct worded in there provide a presentation provided from david duffy on the proposed new richmond cycle safety routes thank you um we can provide information but I think we obviously had a very similar public forum that was going to be presented on another community and and I think this raises um the fact that actually we have a number quite a bit of funding in the proposed long-term plan for I guess local connections and I think it's really important we actually look at what that presents for the for the city um so maybe we need to actually um tie that into a wider some wider information to present back to the committee on I guess the second stage of a cycleway program that will actually allow cycleway connections to be connected and and also for any gaps in the networks to be filled up do you want that noted or included okay in the presentation and the presentation to the richmond cycle safety about yeah about local communities cycleways full stop delivery I just had a question so what's the question I'm so just wondering when we can share the even attacker mcr kind of root considerations so that's that's because there's probably been saved to the transport report which is coming up very shortly well I mean for those of us who have seen it it seems like we're just talking about the scientists okay answered you and it just further to to that um note um and and maybe how communities raise a need for you know their concern or how do we go through the process of actually a community bringing uh their attent the attention of the committee to the fact that they need a connecting part to a cycle way how how does the process work yeah yeah look we'll take it off take that offline take it off okay so that's different this is just included so we'll take that off offline yeah aaron did you want to say something before we well it's just around the same thing that I think to bring effect but well what they believe is a fact-based presentation to the council that if we were an enabling council we would go why can we not do that and we should on every single cycle way we do we should be weighing up in some areas do we get a better bang for buck by putting this in because you'll get this many people on bikes versus another area where you might not get many but we need to when this comes back it should be why can't it be done not it goes into an eventual long-term plan after all the cycleways are finished I totally agree and it's actually a very good presentation and that's why we need to make sure we actually yeah put a resolution in place to ensure it does not get lost but anyhow I'm happy to move that it's delivered actually stop hanging and stop so I'm just going to move this and we're going to get a second that will uh jake and I'll take it offline and we'll gaps at a later date okay all right jake's three seconds all those in favor any opposed carried and we did the whole time excellent thank you all right we're going to move to items 7
If councillors could take their seats thank you to here to here to here maori ora on march 11 2011 japan experienced a magnitude 9 earthquake the strongest earthquake in its recorded history today is the 10th anniversary of this devastating event just 18 days after our own commemoration the tohoku earthquake caused a tsunami which produced waves up to 40 metres high more than 15 and a half thousand people died more than 450 000 people became homeless the tsunami also severely crippled the infrastructure including as we recall the disaster at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant we join with the people of japan on this day and I'd like to ask you to stand for a minute silence thank you
Just note that confirmation of previous minutes um I'm happy to move the previous minutes do I have a seconder just someone to second the minutes jake mcclellan all those in favor say aye against that's carried and then public forum um nothing today deputations by appointment there are none today and presentation of petitions there are none today so that then ceases moving to item 7 the performance exceptions
All right so now moving to the last item on our open agenda the christchurch city holdings half year report um and paul thank you for joining us I invite you to come to the table and to make any comments on this report before we ask you some questions yeah thank you um very much andrew and uh steve ballard who I think most of you know is here as well if you ask any really difficult questions I'll get steve to answer those um but look I'll take the report as read but I think just in summary um six months ago well nine months ago when we were forecasting at the back end of covet may june last year pretty uncertain environment pretty difficult to actually forecast what um that post covert period was going to look like pleasingly six months down the track it's been a lot stronger um financially than what we thought uh particularly in relation to the most impacted part of our portfolio which was the airport so that domestic air travel market has been a lot more resilient than back in june last year so that's the largest driver of uh the favorable returns relative to what we were expecting in that first half there's still a significant element of uncertainty there though it's you know economically the economy as a whole has performed a lot more um a lot stronger than what probably many commentators projected at the time but there's still that lingering uncertainty there in terms of border closures or border reopening rather the time frames around that are still uncertain and when borders reopen will they stay open and what's the impact and the flow through so there's those sort of issues in the travel context we've got similar challenges in a supply chain context which is impacting more broadly um some of it's linked to covet and some of it's linked to some of the disruptions in auckland um around being the major freight gateway for the sea sea freight um so uh net net I think from council's point of view and cchl's point of view the the headline story is that of 18 million we revised that up to 34 million in december last year as you were going through your ltp process as we sit here today we remain confident that we're on track to deliver that revised dividend forecast of 34 million which would be a decision that the board will make in june and pay in june so that's probably all I had to provide as an overview happy to take any questions thank you are there any questions for paul aaron yeah just on some of the global freight stuff paul um I believe that air freight hasn't changed much in price and the delivery mechanisms have stayed about the same so they're performing really well sea freight on the other hand has gone up 400 per cent as an and is incredibly slow have you feedback from the port company why that is because that'll be affecting our exporters our construction I mean just every industry possible yeah I haven't had feedback on the pricing error um I'm not aware of the 400 step in terms of time frames in and out of new zealand a lot of those are linked to auckland because auckland has been disrupted because they've got an automation project a widely publicised automation project in auckland to automate a lot of activity on the port that hasn't been without challenge and that has caused significant disruption in auckland which is cascaded through the rest of the network because a lot of what comes into auckland is either coastal shipped or road or rail transferred throughout the rest of the country and the coastal shipping network has been disrupted because of the disruptions in auckland um so that has caused timing challenges for importers and exporters and is was there any opportunity for like littleton port to grab some ground off auckland through that yep yep not off auckland necessarily but um I think it's is it public around musk uh I don't know if it's public or not but they've certainly taken some opportunity haven't they to increase their profile yeah I mean lpcr capturing some market share we can talk a little bit more openly and from auckland more from um more adjacent ports right okay yeah because obviously northland took that opportunity at one point had some wins and losses but yeah yeah okay england auckland and tauranga tend to compete I mean the way the port network works um new zealand's a two-hub country a south island hub and a north island hub the north island hub logically is either tauranga or auckland and that's the shipping lines make those choices and as do the importers and exporters lpc is logically you know the main south island hub but there are other options and the coastal shipping network's going to link to that hub so cool thank you all right thank you so I've got jimmy fell and then yarning I just want to clarify mr figa I mean compared to the last year's the first half the net income a net profit reduced almost about 20 million dollars however the total operating revenue uh reduced for uh 42 million dollars there is a gap for the 20 million dollars and also 42 million dollars I just want to this cape 42 and these are 20._``_357.84 so the revenue's down 42. I haven't got the same page number references jimmy I'm sorry then you have but the question was the revenues down 42 million yeah and the profit's down 20 million 10 million that's your question yeah yeah and and as your questions accept the tax tax who else uh well the other difference would be operate operating costs yeah yeah yeah operating costs yeah so I mean that's a consolidated figure though so it's a it's a an addition of effectively the eight subsidiary companies so there's a number of moving parts uh and there there's probably 20 or 30 different things going on there to actually fully answer your question okay okay thank you thank you film yeah thanks paul um I think you were being quite um nice to auckland saying it was challenging and the word disaster would be a lot better I'm just asking a question lpcs not as far as you know aren't looking to have an automated system and run interest you know at some point that is an option uh it's on their radar they're not about to press go on it they're watching with interest and learning from what auckland are experiencing um and there's no immediate plans to follow suit apart from the loss of money and well we have ships coming in and out and stuff just clagged up in auckland it's hopeless um all because of that system yeah you've only got to go to auckland you can see there's there's 10 or 15 vessels sitting out there just moored for days I just want to see that happen down here no and it's not happening down here but despite not happening down here there are some challenges because we've had vessels in it at lpc birthed that have got a slot to get into auckland on their way out or on their way back that means they can't spend the amount of time they've needed to spend here to actually unload everything so there's been cargo that's come into port be unloaded because I've got to go to get the slot in sydney or get the slot in auckland and then they had to come back so you don't get it off you can have there's been vehicles you know vehicle movements that have actually been into port but haven't got off the boat until the second time around those are the sort of things that are happening all the time unfortunately which we can't control yeah all right thank you yani um I'm struggling to understand why both enable and orion are such um major sponsors of the chamber of commerce like they're monopolies I can't see what benefit it is for them to be involved in a sort of lobby organisation um I think they see themselves as corporate citizens of of canterbury um and supporting uh organizations uh like the two you mentioned who are key stakeholders in our community and our corporate community um they see supporting those and aligning themselves with those organizations as being consistent with their broader objectives in a commercial context do you find organization that wants us to sell off our assets no I mean I mean so I mean the first question is valid and I think the answer is pretty obvious um the second is going well beyond what's a reasonable question for a six monthly report um I mean the the reason strategically why our companies would want to have a relationship with others in the business community I think the answer is pretty obvious but it's a valid question um the second question I don't think is a a reasonable question for the six monthly report at all so but they're part of the organization that makes submissions to us during the ltp why wouldn't they be neutral all right so okay the other thing is um can can I just get a sense of what's happening as part of a letter of expectation we expected that we get a report at least six monthly on progress of achieving remuneration expectations across the group and in implementing the living wage can you give us I was quite concerned for example that the orion us some sense of what's been happening with our expectations across the remuneration and also the living wage what the trends are any you know I think personally any transparency we could get when ceos are appointed would be welcome but I mean obviously I'll leave that for you to respond so there's a workshop um next week next tuesday to cover uh all of that so that's the appropriate forum to work through that why can't so what what are we workshopping every aspect of the question you just asked but this is like a month this is a the six monthly report so we can't get any sense now what what's been well there's a a package of information that we've got that addresses that that's not before you today and it's not in front of me today either but I think we can have a much more informed discussion if we can allow if you can allow us to take you through um a package of information that sets all of that out which we're no the workshop won't be public is there anything that we can say publicly about what's been happening uh well let's discuss that at the workshop on tuesday that's the purpose of the workshop and we've also got the um statements of intent coming back obviously given the discussion that happened around the letter of expectation I imagine that some of the matters that you're talking about will come into play around the statements of intent discussion which is why the workshop prior to that is important but the comments in the media for example when new ceos are appointed and we refuse to release how much they're getting paid just looks bad right and that's public so I can't understand why we shouldn't be able at least to show what the general trends are in terms of our performance monitoring around let's as paula suggest the living wage has got huge public interest yeah as does ceo remuneration so let's get the information which is the important part that's what we want that's what we said that we expect if paul's um electing to bring that to us by way of a workshop and that's the best forum to present that information then that works but quite rightly and you're raising it now how and when the information that's presented at the workshop and to what extent that becomes public will be something that is absolutely on the table for discussion at the workshop um including the specific matters that you've raised but let's um let's have the workshop and see what's been presented and then once we've got that information we're in a far better position to discuss how we want to handle it but I don't doubt and looking at the um public discussion that happened around the letter of expectation that some of the matters that you've raised will come into the discussion for the um statement of attention of intent as well so getting the timing and sequencing of this right and getting the correct and full information will be vital in terms of um the development of the add on that no look I'm really looking forward to the workshop discussion I think we've got a couple of hours set aside and I think that's a much more appropriate way to actually work it through with the right information in front of everybody so we're speaking the same language yeah I mean what we're hearing today is that there's a you know degree of interest a strong degree of interest in the matters that um we're going to be discussing at that workshop um let's have the workshop and you know at that time we can work out where we go from there with that information may well be the statement of intent discussion is where much of it lands and the workshop sort of linked to that andrew exactly right correct um yeah and we that's what we agreed we would do that was my understanding yeah yeah absolutely all right moving on to further questions um aaron yeah uh sorry should I asked her before so just around the uh airport um and uh under the in passenger numbers and uh also international passenger volumes they're all obviously in red but the comment has no expectation of a tasman bubble and fy 21 and no expectation of a wider border opening and is that updated now no that well that was the view at 31 december um if we updated it um a month ago it might have been the same if we updated it even a week ago it might have been the same if we updated it earlier this week it might have changed but we're going to find out on the 6th of april I believe it's a really difficult um difficult one to call yes and even if we have certainty around a time frame to open up a trans tasman bubble um how that then plays out is inherently uncertain as well yeah so from uh speaking to some of the staff there that obviously they're ready to go and they have plans if it happens but we've been ready to go since october last year yeah but from the government's perspective have we heard only or are they talking will christchurch in the south island be in the conversation I'm led to believe it's definitely a national um so they're effectively thinking about new zealand there's another state of australia if you want to think about it that way so it'll be a state by state bubble from new zealand into different states of australia that won't be auckland-centric the intentions if you look at the websites of the airlines who are taking forward bookings um they are taking bookings in and out of christchurch and auckland so definitely christchurch is well positioned cool thank you any further questions all right so um we uh we've got a resolution in front of us to um note the reports do I have a mover for that tim seconded by pauline discussion yep yani um so I was just a little bit concerned around some of the information in the report that two of our companies are major sponsors of the chamber of commerce who submitted that cchl be directed to bribe council with advice on how to repackage for new investments and I mean I just find it a little bit ironic really that there's this kind of um advocacy and lobbying which I welcome from the chamber that they're entitled entirely able to do that but it does seem to me that there is a bit of a conflict of interest issue happening here where you've got major funders who we own then paying an organization to come and criticize us it seems a bit weird so I mean you know it's no criticism of the chamber I understand the role that they play in the city but I just wonder um how we're kind of measuring the value of what we're getting from that from our companies and whether cchl needs to have some sort of policy around that so you know I welcome the information in the report I do think we need to start thinking about the remuneration and living wage in a transparent way and although I welcome the workshop the reality is that this huge public interest in terms of what's happening with living wage as open and transparent as possible when it comes to discussing that so that the public can see what's going on so I'm happy to receive the report I obviously um I think it's probably apparent that others don't share my concerns around around that but I would encourage you to read the submissions from the chamber to past annual and ltps um and to reflect on um whether it's appropriate that we're that our companies are funding criticism of ourselves or whether there's a better use of that money um coming back to the right place thank you tim I'm not thank you and I think it's actually a really good thing that our companies are involved with the chamber of commerce they do a hell of a lot for the business in christchurch um I don't think we've got to the stage where we blacklist people organizations that have a different view than we do and um I think that if we got to that stage none of us would be sitting here we'd probably be that we're involved in it the training that the um the um channel economists do throughout all businesses of all sizes is absolutely exceptional and as a backbone to the industry in christchurch and canterbury so I'm really pleased that they are thank you any further discussion sarah I just add that you know companies like citicare help sponsor student volunteer army and those kind of projects and yeah when it was received we were told that we were we were told in the informal letters because it was just receiving it was okay yeah yeah the advice that we've given was that um that's the case yeah is there any further discussion on this report no all right so this has been moved and seconded I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that's carried all right so now if we can move to the resolution to exclude
Against that's carried thank you so now we'll move to the half yearly reports for the same organizations uh I was I was planning to take these as read there's very little to say but I could run through quickly and just mention lgfa has the covert implications have come through as an increase in borrowing by councils so bearing in mind this is for the period one july to 31 december last year um rickard and bush trust has had some benefit of no sorry has has reduced its third party income from the cafe and tours primarily as a result of the closed borders it's also affected domestically when the levels shift the restrictions on travel internally I put on rod donald banks peninsula trust has actually had an increase in domestic use of the rod donald hut um and its key variances relate to a land purchase that it's got underway and it's been raising income for that raising donations for that and that's all I've got all right thank you so tim's happy to move sarah you all right so these have been moved and seconded I put the motion all those in favor say aye against as carried thank you and
Thank you all right so now we'll move to item 9 the council control organization's draft statements of intent and linda and len welcome to the table so these are civic building lgfa rickord and bus trust and rod donald banks peninsula trust any commentary on these um just by way of kicking this one off do you want to do the drafty so eyes first so we've got the um sorry item nine yes the draft sois yes please yep so we'll do the draft sois first and then item 10 is the half yearly reports for the same organizations so these are the draft decisive building local government funding agency rickett and bush trust rob donald banks peninsula trust the general view our general view is that it could be some improvements made in the drafting of these strategic objectives nature and scope of operations and performance measures but they uh we can we can talk to each of the uh trusts uh the two trusts and civic building about those um prior to the finalization uh the as an aside the draft sois to finance and performance on the 29th of april after workshops transwaste soi has been received and will go to the um joint committee in april uh no no draft sois have been received for central plains water trust or the samua project um central plains war trust has been given an extension uh and we have no knowledge of what's where these similar drafts away is uh the draft festival is to the extent uh there are still covert implications that weren't uh expected last year the draft sois have updated for that the key the key covert um impact is a general view that borders won't open until 2022 and that will affect um rickett and bush trust in terms of tours and the cafe lgfa potentially more pressure on borrowing from local councils and that is the it's about the sum of it I'm happy to take questions all right thank you so um just noting that um resolution two that really picks up the feedback that you'll be giving around the specifics and the clear strategic objectives and I think that obviously gives you the ability to go back and do that in each case which is good so moving to questions yawning I think um in the rickett bush uh draft statement of intent I know that um the goal four is to increase visitation but when you go through to the performance targets um it I i may have missed it but I don't see any target around no so the target's been removed for this period while the borders are closed their ability to increase visitation is severely impacted by that right so I've noted in the report that we will make sure that as soon as they get back to a kind of business as usual that that performance target will come back in again I guess from my point of view I don't know how others feel but I think it is quite good to get visibility of it like obviously recognizing that we're in a different environment but it would still be good to track the trends around the statement of intent but they'll be tracking it anyway possibly should be being targeted and and maybe it is maybe it's not but I would have thought what we've seen around new zealand is there has been an increase in some sort of visitation for some tourist operators well part of our feedback we can go back to bush and we'll talk to them about whether they record that domestic um talent and we'll see what they can do I mean it usually flows through when I talk about the variances and so usually I will comment on whether uh donations or it's in the annual report as well so it's not it's not a problem I don't think it's a big ask but I just think um you know it may be that I don't know we're trying to change the marketing the real question will be whether we can get something that's reasonable we don't want to put a target in that's unachievable but we'll work with them on that and are you able to um advise what the equity consists of yeah purely mostly in the truck and the um the all right thank you any further questions mike I'm just looking at the um psy for um civic building and in its um performance target it has environmental and social performance targets but it doesn't actually have a social performance target it just has an environmental one and I would have thought that actually you know having an accessible building would be quite a good social target and I'm just wondering if we need to they need to have a look at actually putting a social target in there if they say they're going to have social targets we're going to look thank you nothing else building whether we need to think about um what our statement of intent is or if we need to send them a um letter of expectation I don't know if others had any concern about it but sorry can you just repeat that question for staff do you think there's anything we should be asking cbl to do differently in the upcoming year ah no no no yeah it's it's very narrow scope of work that they do it would be it's fairly straightforward in that sense yeah I mean was there something that you were wanting to raise yeah uh well I i mean yeah I mean if you look at that um you know it just does seem like they're making good good money off the building but in terms of the statement of intent there's nothing that you're proposing as a change no I don't quite understand that the timing of these processes but yeah if people don't feel there's anything needed to be added fine maybe through delivery expectation exactly yeah yeah all right thank you jimmy yeah I declared the country interest for the next time yeah we we noted at the beginning of the meeting because we noted at the beginning of meeting there are a number of councillors who've got roles on these trusts and um boards and obviously you're one of those that's fine thank you it's noted all right so um we have got the for those mike and a seconder tim any discussion all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you so now we'll
So now let's move to item eight the capital project performance report and ruth thank you for joining us again we'll take the report as read are there any particular parts of this report you want to draw our attention to or any comments that you'd like to make thank you good morning everyone so this is the report to the end of february 2021 uh I'll speak to the current financial year first so page 43 our current financial year forecasts against our core program budget of 375.5 our project managers are still forecasting a spend of 380.3 so we're still in a bring back position against the core program uh against the full financial year budget of five five two point five we're forecasting a spender for ninety uh so performance today in our future month forecast for this financial year uh you'll see that january and february spend was lower than forecast by around about 14 million so this does require a delivery units to recover that spend in future months as well as deliver on the forecast that they summary page on page 41 delivery units have confirmed that they will be able to recover that spend so 8.5 million of that was for transport rather it was in transport and that is work that has been completed but is not yet built so it will end into the system uh in future months and 3.8 million of that was actually a negative spend it was just a transferable land purchase into three waters and three waters we'll be spending that are forecasting to spend that this financial year so based on the discussions that we had at last committee you'll now see the detail relating to future month forecasts by delivery unit on pages 46 to 48 so this is in a different format than you've seen before so on the left of those pages you'll see the current month forecast and then the forecast per delivery unit that makes up that full month forecast and within that there is detail around what makes up that delivery unit forecast that's good so I'll make some general comments on deliverability this financial year come up and speak to what specifically they are doing within those months to deliver on those forecasts so in terms of general comments as per last month our core program is still forecasting a bring back which is a unique position which means that against our core program we're still able to accommodate some unforeseen issues in the final months of the year across council we remain in an improved position for projects in construction and so construction is where we do see the majority of spend so we would want to see a lot of projects in construction so we have 300 this year which is forecasting a remaining spend of 147 million and that compares to last year where we had 230 so 70 less forecasting a remaining spend of 118 million so that means we've got 29 million dollars worth of projects that are in construction that we didn't have this time last year and so last year our performance against that forecast in march of 118 was 80 despite covert lockdown of six weeks so we'd expect to see a better units um transport's in an improved position so they've got 57 projects in construction forecasting 50 million versus 36 last year forecasting 35. uh in three waters we're in a similar position with 97 projects in construction forecasting 40 million I'll let them talk a little bit more about their units shortly forecast accuracy given that the less spend in january and february uh than forecast is at 80 which is still a reasonably good forecast accuracy but if we were to model that out this financial year it would end up with a result of around 321 million spend against the core program which is around a 14 carry forward so that's just on forecast accuracy alone though so I'll invite the delivery units to come up and talk specifically around their plan to deliver to the end of financial year starting with three waters um so john are you able to come up three waters has seen a spent today of 74. they've got a remaining spend of 90 million and they've got some big land purchases coming up but to refer to pages 46 and 48 you'll be able to see the detail that these delivery units will be speaking to I don't have a great deal to add than I did from our last finance and performance meeting where I gave confidence that we were going to meet our delivery targets um just to add that that confidence um does reduce in time as the closer we get to the end of the financial year and some of the issues that we're experiencing are unexpected consent conditions on some of our larger projects in the land drainage area which we're endeavoring to resolve and some delays in getting procurement completed through post-tender clarifications and closing out tags apart from that we are still in negotiations with the la one large land purchase of about six million dollars which needs to be finalized everything else is pretty much as I stated last meeting all right thank you um transport let's take the presentation from all of the um areas from all of the units and then if there are questions we can bring staff I haven't got very much force maybe richard needs to do it for the comedy venue um similar to three waters we we haven't changed a lot since last month however we have a lot transport has a lot of projects in contract a large number of mcrs dyes pass road is underway and martians road bridge are the big ones sorry and that is largely what is giving us the confidence on the spend we also have a number that uh have closed tenders that have short construction periods and are about to start including cashmere names thanks all right we thought your ears might have pricked up at that point that's all good all right thank you and then finally it's the major facility so cmua and metro I see alastair's not in the room but I can speak to metro as you know it's a third party delivered project the forecasts that we have in our system are those that we receive from them so we don't have any control over those forecasts and then I understand you're just make some few more final comments just around the watch list you'll note that two of our transport projects are now in handover enclosure so the hereford street in victoria street um great successful projects there instant auburn's community centre also practical completion this month with the opening next month early april and then you'll see that you've got a new report this month so instead of providing delivery completes from the previous period you'll now see what we've been able to achieve for the whole financial year um so there's a considerable effort to get all of those projects delivered to date this financial year so we'll keep that updated kind of rolling forward um for the financial year so happy to take any questions now thanks all right thank you so if a first look at the table on um or the graph on page 45 um you know we're not delivering to forecast in january and february and we've got some very ambitious forecasts that obviously we're hearing that we are expecting to deliver to from delivery units you know is really reinforcing that high level of confidence and that's good for us to hear and can I also say that the format of the report where we are now breaking this down by delivery unit makes it far easier to understand and to have confidence in the information that's been presented so so thank you for that but at a high level um really and I think we've got this right you are confirming a high level of confidence around delivery of what are really some quite ambitious targets over the next four months yeah I think like if you look at how we were doing last year our spend today if we had delivered on january and february would be about the same and as you know we moved out and you'll plan a value down budget down to reflect our previous year delivery and our delivery units are saying that we can recover january and february because it was work completed not built and so if we are able to do that we are on track to deliver um the snapshot of um where we were at in february when this report was put together um no further update on that the information that we've got here is the most current alistar's here I do but I believe sorry I'm russian um john bridgeman's due to address council shortly so he's the invite's been sent and he's received and he's coming in to talk to the metro sports specifically regarding the questions that have been raised here yeah all right yes there was a big article in the newspaper about it being delayed yeah can we just clarify whether that's existing information that we're aware of or whether that's new information the delay has always been noted it's been and the covered environments created that delay so it's just it's the extent of that delay has not been publicly notified and that's why john's coming in to speak to you all right so we'll wait for john to come in and we'll have that conversation at that time exactly I the 29th I think which yeah if we can make sure that that's in people's calendars so that we get good attendance of that meeting that would be great thank you all right so that's everything from me are there any other questions on this um report jimmy also on page 44 yeah but at least metro sports facility today due to the other kind of kobe 19 whether the contractor requests the the the cost from the council or not requests because due to the shutdown you know there's a further delay yeah the negotiations around the covert variations for metro sport are undertaken by our third party so we don't have visibility of that okay thank you second one is on page the 66 the major cycle route south express the section two the completion date I'm not sure because we start from the section three section two section one so whether the same the completion data on by december 22 should be amended by december 21 because now it's almost go to the uh ten tender tender process mri in as I understand it through you mr chair that's consistent with what we've reported previously so nothing's changed still I said still okay but why you need to take so long so long time to follow you go to the tender you need to take another one and a half years just complete but but it is the section one you have not yet go to tender just detail design but you can complete by the april 22. that's the planning day if we can deliver it earlier we will okay quite unreasonable I just confused I'm reasonable so that's no change jimmy has been noted from previous information that we've had on this because you section one you have not yet attended just detailed design you can complete it by the april 22 by the section two now you almost will be go to the candle why you still need to take on december 22. three mr chair it's it's consistent with what we've reported previously and it's it's simply the planning date so look as we update you accordingly okay thank you all right thank you any further questions on the report yanni um page 63 my my favorite the littlest and harbor wastewater scheme um it's now turned to amber you say ground conditions and contractual which is to be resolved design changes requiring significant input from council staff slowing down construction fronts uh I mean the poor residents of el port place they've literally had a decade of repairs and works in their little street for 10 years and this project um is still showing a risk does can can anyone tell me what the actual risks are and what the yeah what the time frame is for resolving them and if there's anything I'll just keep repeating if there's any sort of enhancement that we can do as a temporary or transitional measure to try and give those residents some some something to feel good about rather than just having um work site on their street for 10 years um through the chair we don't have the right people in the room for that right now so us some information yeah it doesn't join it as I understand it the only risk on that project is related to budget and that is being resolved through a change request and that is yet to be determined whether it is um there is a risk to budget we're just flagging it at this stage so everything else I understand is on target and what you have highlighted in terms of some ground conditions is probably just reflective of why that's um a risk to budget is there any scope within the project actually tidy up the end of the street that's basically being used at a work site you're talking about all port places um I'll I'll take that up with the project manager and see what we can do with it yeah just some nice plantings or something just to kind of return it to some sort of state rather than just doesn't you know certainly we'll have we'll have a look at that yeah okay that would be really cool um the other thing the question I master plan on track because there's I know there's two different projects going on there but it does seem very slow we had a community drop-in session um that was scheduled and I don't think staff thought that the work would be outside of where the drop-in session was but it was still there so it's showing here that it's all on track but I just wanted to get confirmation and I know that there's a waste water and a ready project it is all on track as to the dates and the watch list my understanding is there's been an update to the board recently so have you had as the board had a memo recently I'll follow that up because it's true to go out to the board but it will be done by the june date yes so the work's progressing as expected yeah okay that's thank you um and just um just just finally just interested in the waitaki project the orc where it says it's been delayed because of contamination issues um sorry't find it but it's the one um that's got it's said that it's been delayed because of significant contamination issues and I'm just wondering why we didn't know about that when we approved it because I'm sure that there were people in this room that had some sense of the sight not being ideal or maybe yeah just struck me as unusual I understand it'll just that is a matter of just following standard project management procedure um before we start on a project we have to have approval to proceed and then after that we get into our investigations and our detailed site investigations and it's probably not until that time that we find that there's contamination and have to take account of it do we know what sort of contamination is there I don't specifically but I'm guessing there's probably a bit of asbestos there um I doubt that there's um hydrocarbons or anything like that so it'll involve taking it to cape valley and then possibly some additional expense and consenting I think you just got a question on the the northern line have you got a page number for that one 65. thank you thanks I i noticed since the last the watch list that the line for the five rail crossings has been removed which had a expected delivery date of june 22nd and now there's obviously a number also that have of um sections have been pushed out to uh december 22 from a range of dates from june and october 22. I'd just like to get some information on when we're expecting to see those rail crossings actually delivered and has there been a delay in them there hasn't been a delay we're still working through them with key rail and finalizing the dates so okay this is improving the information that we knew on last month so the crossings have all been incorporated within the sections so from the information you know now when would you expect to see the crossings completed the crossings will be later than the then we initially thought because of the requirements to get um gates to make it better okay so it's like december 22nd this is the best this is the best and there's nothing we can do to we are working positively with cairo at the moment yeah so we're getting some of them done historics barns and others are being pushed forward we are struggling with herewood and linkedin's but we are working on them um council davidson you will recall we actually raised this specifically with the minister and then hence we did see an improvement in the situation it is still moving forward positively yes but I have a new report that has the date pushed out and I don't see that moving forward positively I see that delay there's a delay sorry and we have it as you're aware this two intersections actually are accident waiting to happen and I'm extremely concerned about the length of time that this project has taken to be completed when we have money government money so and I repeat we saw an improvement in that situation however I have said to lynette any other problems us so that we can race it again to keep putting the pressure back on if we're not seeing a shift thank you all right so we've got a recommendation in front of us to receive the information in the reports I'm happy to move that jimmy you're second all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you all right so now we'll move to item 9 the council control organization's draft statements of
Got it um there's nothing on the screen yet so we've got right so it was uh moved sam seconded andrew all those in favor any against all right carrie thank you very much uh any declarations of interest for today all right uh confirmation of previous minutes you're not happy to move those pauline second to tim all I was in favor any against I don't clear that carried thank you very much um and now we move to the public forum so welcome we've got uh two groups today who get five minutes each for public forum to raise issues so the first one is the on barrington mall so jill kearns welcome you to the table thanks very much for coming along today and raising this for us dear counselors today I'm presenting you with a suggested bylaw for your consideration which I have outlined below the intent is to eradicate the ongoing issue with beggars lingering and basing themselves on council property the recommendation is for council to put in place a bylaw whereby no begging can take place near community facilities the main reason for this bylaw to be introduced are public health and safety allowing the community to enjoy our community facilities without being harassed intimidated or verbally abused the eradication of potential traffic incidents involving members of our community general safety of our community and likewise the safety of the individual bigger beggars thank you thank you very much and I know that the issue goes beyond begging to that anti-social behaviour so that's really important I do have any questions got time for one question thank you thank you for your presentation and realize that it's an ongoing issue for you and I see that gary's sitting with you so I'm wondering if you've had conversations about how this is being approached in the inner city gary and I have actually spoken um because it is a problem actually uh christchurch-wide um today I'm I've got two hats on I've got my hat on as a a member of our community but also I am the centre manager of barrington shopping centre and I see this being an also other strip shopping as well so gary and I used to have spoken about it it's a growing issue that's great now that we do have the time up there is there is a bit more time so mike look thanks for your deputation and obviously we're seeing the issues of antisocial behaviour my question is actually not to you it's more to staff because when we um passed the public places by law we made a resolution in there to actually request staff to investigate a regulatory mechanism in regards to antisocial nuisance behaviour and I just haven't heard any update of what happened to that and that was actually a number of years ago so I'd sort of like to know because that's if we had that tool you know in our tool kit we may have to do something actually where there is a nuisance behaviour actually occurring um so I'm just wondering if we can get an update on actually that resolution that was passed by council a number of years ago so I would probably have um the proposal that when paul lonsdale was a councillor um no no no it was the hearings panel that I cheered so it was last term and it was passed by council to actually investigate this um but I haven't seen any update of actually what happened with with either I would chase it up with policy not sure where it is okay so danny you've got a question for jill or a question for staff um well uh probably probably both but just I'm probably the first to gel I'm thank you for the deputation have you contacted the police and if so what's their response been uh I've exhausted we've exhausted all avenues I look um our shopping centre is privately owned so the so the whenever we have a beggar we trespass them from our property our property is not the issue it's the issue out on the footpath and all other council facilities that's why I'm suggesting this by law because at the end of the day the police cannot enforce anything until you pass the problem being is there's probably a dozen or so people they are not homeless unfortunately they're feeding a habit they're not very nice people and we don't want these people in our community doing what they're doing why should we have to put up with it they're saying they're homeless and they need food but actually they're not and no one needs to be homeless in our city we all know that it might be helpful to get like where they actually are where where they are are they well the police have I actually have known they know exactly where they are they know the people they know what they do they do a circuit of the city they have someone drop them off in a car the the police have all that information okay so we will take this offline because we've got to the sort of the end of the not enough time for a full question and answer and we've got some other constraints this morning yeah um so gary you'll chase up on about and um and if you want to send something through I i just think I'd like to suggest that we have a briefing to actually look at this together as a city-wide issue and look at what's actually happening what we are doing and what we can do we'll take it offline can we do that that would be great thank you thank you okay thank you so much for coming next up we have the sydney heritage trust so we've got david rankin coming to speak and people have been given an a3 piece of paper and some other bits and pieces with some information from the trust there so welcome unfortunately it's only a five minute slot but we do have a lot of additional information too so if you'd like to sort of highlight the key points that you're really keen to make today thank you very much um good morning I'm david rankin I've been authorised by the trustees presentation and I'm supported on the 27th of april 2001 the trust was formed in cooperation was acquired by the trust in sydney with the support and assistance of the council including a mortgage of four hundred and twelve thousand five hundred dollars in an email date of the 18th of october councillor sue wells stated good news the church is insured and that was 2010. she also stated the loan has been written off in the council books this means the council does not expect payment for it but if the property was to be sold for example the loan would have to be repaid history shows that the church was demolished without authorization following the 2011 earthquake after the trusted spent considerable funds on restoration and much work including re-roofing of up over seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars the insurance was arranged by council through its associate civic insurance which proved to be totally inadequate providing an insurance settlement of 334 000 plus gst which was paid to council as mortgagee funds from this have been made available to the trust to help with the site cleanup and saving of stonework and historical items leaving just over 206 000 available in credit on the council requesting financial support of five hundred thousand spread over two years to release the insurer and to release the insurance funds held and to waive council charges to help facilitate the erection of a replacement building to go on the site for a museum meeting room plus cafeteria incorporating original stonework and stained glass windows I think you will agree that the plan as shown on the screen and provided provides an exciting opportunity to create an entrance statement for the commencement of the main sydney commercial area as set out in the project rationale provided your support for this project is a continuation of the partnership established between council and the trust in 2001. this project if one looks at the objectives of this committee would provide a strong sense of community active participation in civic life safe and healthy communities celebration of our identity through arts culture heritage sport and recreation valuing the voices of all cultures be could be made available to all in all ages and it would be building as part of the strategic priorities enabling active and connected communities to assist with project and free engineering and we believe that the amount that's being requested of council to help facilitate this project is a very small amount compared with what similar other facilities have cost over the years the sydney community is growing immensely with infill housing and it's known that and recently reported that one in 13 people in our community have ex anxiety issues so the more we do to strengthen our resilience in our community the better our community will be for the future already this site has been developed and there's car parking associated with it and the subdivision has taken place and the the trust is expected to have some funds on hand but we consider that this is a very appropriate project to justify council support and so we ask that you consider favorably providing the funding that we've requested spread over two years which will be the 2022 and 23 years so thank you for the opportunity thank you very much for um coming and updating us on that today uh we've run out of time for questions but um issues that you've raised and make sure that comes back to us as well so that we can be fully informed and up-to-date um on that process how much they want against it got a bit convoluted with the loan how much are you needing we were seeking five hundred thousand dollars and it would preferred as a grant but if you wanted to make it a loan we've even suggested in the proposal you have before you with the papers that um we're happy to transfer the property to the council and take a lease back on it the same as what happened when in 1979 when the old stone house was developed I was actually involved in that project at the time thank you very much what we'll do is we'll request staff advice back on all of those issues and the processes and the stage of the application at the moment all right thanks pauline thank you very much for coming along thank you just a quick question sam or john um are you able to get that advice through I don here yeah we uh uh we we have done some work with the uh the trust and we probably will be in a position to uh get advice across we'll have a a closer look and uh uh get back to you yeah so it'll be great thank you very much okay um and next we move to deputation from the christchurch heritage charitable trust so welcome anna and shawn and this relates to the community organisation loan scheme report on today's agenda mr cross nice good morning councillors I'd like to introduce I'm anna crichton I'd like to introduce my team sean stockman and chris houseman trustees of the christchurch heritage trust and I'm chair of that trust I'm not going to say a lot excellent report in front of you it's detailed it's got everything on it that you could possibly want and I'm very pleased that of the high standard of that report it's it's it's really good so thank you to staff for that I just want to say two things there shan's that's how we found it now shan's is a loved building in central christchurch now how many private investors would take that on and restore it move it somewhere else and restore it not many not many at all I mean that's the sort of state that we headed in and now it's fully restored earthquake strengthened fire sprinklers in it and ready to go the other slide I would put up is the interior of trinity now this is a beautiful beautiful timbered vaulted ceiling that is not seen anywhere else in that iteration anywhere architecturally within probably the southern hemisphere and this building was two weeks away from being demolished so what I'm saying to you is the christchurch heritage trust saved these two buildings for the city of christchurch because that's our objective that's our mission to save heritage for the people of christchurch as tangible reminders of our past we are a non-profit charitable trust and that is why we have come to you for a loan so that we may finish the work that we've all I need to say but I'd be very happy to take questions from you should you have any thank you thank you do we have any questions from people no just like that thank you very much um and we will have uh one agenda item ahead of yours um today so if you stick around for that'll be wonderful thank you thank you okay any uh so there's no presentation of petitions and so now we move to item seven uh the minutes of te tera kahikuhiku and welcome chrissy williams so much for coming along chrissy thank you it doesn't feel like it was three months ago does it no no um just thank you to aiden for um having those slides ready to go um and and as I can I do I don't know um as I start presenting the minutes in the last three months I just really want to acknowledge the staff that support us so we have um brendan winder here in the city in central in this building as red zone manager but also the staff reports that we get so just really want to acknowledge them so we've tried to minimize my presentation today by including in the report some summaries which I think presented as powerpoint last time of the leases and licenses that we've made recommendations to lins about um presentations we received and grants from the um for the redzone transformation transformative fund so you can read the minutes but I've kind of summarized those in that the front report that you have we have also deferred a couple of recommendations where we think that we one we need more information about or we consider that the site that the applicant has applied for is not appropriate for what they want so we've suggested they go back and talk with linds and the city council to see if there's an alternative site within the red zone that that they could use the other thing we're noticing about applications is that um they're coming through because the land is effectively free for people we seem to be getting applications that I would question whether they really's I think a question that should be asked early on in the process you know why why do you need to be in the red zone I mean for example I think we might be going to see one about a show home so does that need to be in the red zone or could it be somewhere else but the land is effectively free and that's something you might want to consider as time goes on especially for commercial type of operations whether that land does continue to be free for lease so I've just got three issues I thought I'd raise with you today one is that an um in a meeting we had with lund's in december that um a subgroup of the terra kahika um and the city council they told us that they were going to limit leases to six months so this is an anticipation of the land being handed over to council um I don't think it will be handed over in six months I'll be I think we'll all be surprised if glenn's ready to hand over but what they are then saying is to people whose proposals are for longer than six months to go through to council um for their application so two things I think uh arise from that one is that the council needs to be ready you you consider it the policy in november um for how council will process applications so they've got the policy sitting there um but we need to make sure that the portal or whatever is used so that people can can apply to council and be considered for transitional and possibly permanent uses so that needs to be ready and there has been some discussion I think but I think it would be good to progress this is is that the council negotiates with lin's maybe with the minister um so that just the decisions on transitional land uses can be taken from london delegated to the city council for the next x months because at the moment it's incredibly messy for um proponents they don't know whether to go to london's where they don't know pro only considering transitional uses though many of the applications are effectively permanent uses so um I you know I think that's that may be underway but I think it would be good to expedite that um the second item that's being discussed a lot with people in the community is around the long term governs so I know there's a lot of work happening on this and some of us have been involved with discussions with staff and elected members but it's unlikely to be in place before december and maybe even take longer than that so um it's important that um for your policy to work that te tera kahikuhiku continues um the terms of reference did set it up for three years um but not all the appointments are in place for that so I think you'll be receiving a report from staff on ensuring that and because of the late start of the group um mostly because of covert the two-year budget has only been partially spent so I think there's a proposal in the draft for for and budget so that um she has got some funding to to operate and also to to make grants from so just letting you know that it'll be hidden somewhere in the ltp it's a tiny amount compared with what you're mostly considering and I think just a reminder that you know there's a lot of talk about the co-governance group but for it to work you're really going to have to consider and be willing to delegate decision-making to a charitable trust and that you know I know that can will be really hard um but also to provide significant funding to provide staffing and um money for them to do some work so it's not just setting up the co-governance group there's a lot of um sort of think policy thinking and funding thinking just that we start behind it um and then the last issue um and you should recall that the greater christchurch regeneration act um 2016 was amended last year um but the parts that are relevant to regeneration plans and recovery plans are planned will be revoked on canterbury earthquake recovery act moved across to the greater gross regeneration act in 2016 all the recovery plans in place were carried forward so the littleton port recovery plan the lerp um the chris central recovery plan or whatever its name is I always get the names wrong about the cranford basin recovery plan so all those got carried forward and since then the um the otaku avon river corridor regeneration has been developed under the greater christ future regeneration act um you'll also be aware that under the under the regeneration plan the provisions to for the region plan have been inserted into the christ registered plan so there's a section um for the special purpose of otakura even river corridor in the district plan so the district plan really does say what the recovery regeneration planners want him to achieve but I and just um just in thinking through this I mean I think council has accepted that and looking at your submission to the amendment last year is that you don't feel a need for those regeneration recovery plans to continue because they have it would be really helpful for for you and for us if the regeneration plan was somehow taken on board as a council I don't know whether it's a policy strategy plan mean your staff can work out what you would call it but that all the work that went into this isn't lost because the district plan what's in the district plan is very sort of rules-based whereas this is more about intent and visions and objectives so um I think that would be quite helpful rather than trying to seek legislation to continue it that you somehow take it on borders as your plan and you may want to think about some of the recovery plans I don't know whether staff have done the analysis of if there's anything still useful in those that isn't in the district plan um that you might want to consider adopting some of those recovery plans as as your plans as well so um and that's probably getting a little bit bit outside my mandate but you know having worked on these for the all the work that went into them isn't isn't lost by the revocation of a of a regeneration act um yeah so that that was all I wanted to raise with you so the sort of pretty meaty um issues probably more than the sort of the day-to-day work of of the our group but they do pertain to our ability to be effective um and having plans in place and having that um knowing that there's going to be some kind of long-term co-governance group so thank you madam chair that's my presentation happy you can answer questions thank you so we do have some questions tim nenyani yeah um thank you very much chris just looking at the the minutes and the granting of temporary lease for grazing um the finns and our port hill ranges have the biggest concern about where urban meets rural and so I just wonder in those lease agreements and I know that only for a short time to may 2021 because of the trends hopefully the transfer but if not there if there could be something in there I know that our ranges are over grazing at the moment to keep everything down and safe and it doesn't seem in the four points mentioned there doesn't seem to be any anything mentioned there so I just wonder in the future if you that could be of a an issue that you'll notice that we've also um further down in that those minutes we've um we've agreed that any grazing applications in the port hills and anything other than the avon river corridor really um would be a staff delegation so they won't even come to our group okay because you know we're talking about avocado valley mostly where they've been um they're single single site sections and the staff have to put a huge amount into each report for grazing that just you know we don't even discuss it just goes through so it becomes an operational matter and I think that the ability to discuss with the people about um how much grazing happens they keep the grass down you know probably sits with brendan moore yeah I just wanted to just raise it cool thank you anything to add brendan uh no take your point though um the the grazing is deliberately done in those areas to deal with the fire risk so it's not explicitly in the uh in the lease agreement that's a implicit requirement we're certainly checking on it so there shouldn't be any issues but we'll talk about changes in teas great thank you yani thank you I was interested in um several I guess high level points um one is um I've noticed that we get the minutes but I've been told that I have to go through lagoima to actually get the reports of the agendas of the meetings and it seems a very non-transparent way to kind of provide information I wondered if the committee had considered like we do at council releasing things when there's no you know having a proactive system to release the applications and the information in the report like the agenda reports when it when it's able to do so rather than waiting for sure we're subject to the grammar actually but um I think we're official information I think it's part of the transition and again we might want to add to this is that when council council's policy that you agree agreed to in november um includes publicly advertising applications that have come in for two weeks so people can make comment on them so the council's process will be more open than currently happens with lin's so um I think that's a real opportunity for we then to consider whether the reports that come to our group then do become public even before we consider them but um or even after you like we often do but after you consider them then have a process to actually have them released yeah and we may need to reject um some personally there might be some confidential promotion but I think some of the built-in uh delay there is to do with the lin's involvement so the sooner we have um it's streamlined that's going to make the whole process easier right um on a neighbouring property and a private owner not not a public owner what's the process to engage with them is there a process where they're involved in sort of being able to provide feedback or being aware of what's proposed and the impact on them is really adamant that there needs to be consultation um with both neighbours but also neighbouring communities before the lease is granted again um that's that's unfamiliar territory for linz um so again once it comes over to council I think that will be easier we we have had some discu our staff have had discussions with lims about advising proponents about what kind of consultation would be necessary depending on the level of their application like some things are an event and and some things are quite quite long term so um but yeah there's definitely that requirement there's also the requirement about um consultation with manafenua and we've cut we've got a hierarchy um established with manafenou for that so that people don't have to go again if it's for something no requirement because it's latins but when it comes to council there will be a requirement in our recommendations we we usually we try and say that there should be consultation before the leases is granted um but how what how that eventuates is really hard to know so some people do a letterbox drop some but that some some of the applicants don't even aware of residence associations or community groups so um it's it's trying to link them with the right people and we haven't_''_3025.68 we haven't had a lot of success with that so um and I'm aware that where we've recommended this in consultation it hasn't happened final question is a bit more specific but on number six on the um february 2021 report third of february the temporary land use application for the moon river flower garden um and it states that it's um that it doesn't fully align with the regeneration plan and the initiative is commercial in nature and then I noted there was quite a split in the vote can and can you just kind of give us some sense of something like that um why that's been approved and you know again like with fencing going on to neighboring property what the process is I don't know why the concern was raised about the fencing but I was interested in that in that in terms of the people around it having some input and whether they did so it's in the green spine but it's it's right on the edge of the of the red zone right on the edge of the green spine um it does require fencing for security reasons so the split in the group was about one being in the greens and in the green spine and one about it being fenced in and excluding public from that area because those are really strong intense for most of the applications for most of the people in the group for the applications um this one went through because it was on the edge it is of temporary nature um that land is just is um and the regeneration plan is set set stay as a garden for the whole time so it was because of um knowing it was temporary that that the consensus that well it wasn't even the consensus in that stage we couldn't reach consensus the vote was that um we did to continue with it so um there was quite a lot of community participation and anticipated in the application involving um school groups and early childhood centres coming to the garden and doing things with flowers and things like that so it wasn't just a commercial operation and although it's called commercial I would say it was probably an it's not a not-for-profit but I wouldn't have been making you know wouldn't have been a really highly profitable venture so and we try and work under consensus um it's a you know 13 people you know what it's like money to try and find some kind of middle ground um especially when it's in the green spine because we have quite you know we do have extreme views but it felt that it was going to activate wasn't going to impact on people's access too know if any chance to provide import whether there was any discussion with neighbours about what type of fencing went in but I saw that that was something that the committee discussed and I wasn't quite sure why they discussed it or what it was discussed by us to say that to my mum if I'm wrong is that the applicant should get advice from council on appropriate fencing the original fencing uh proposal was 1.8 metre wooden pail fencing which would have provided no ability for anyone to see in or see out that was from I think I understand from a security perspective they wanted that the applicant then went to our team leader to talk about having hurricane fencing which was seen around the city there which enables the community to see what's going on it's far cheaper and helps activate that area so if we put everything behind that fence it kind of reduces the benefits of the community of seeing these beautiful flowers and growing their garden so that was where material to be used was discussed with the neighbors I don't know I suspect probably not I mean it seems like a pretty sort of normal thing you'd do if you're putting up fencing you talk with the neighbor on the boundary you would certainly only if you're asking them to pay for it probably yeah okay that's one thing and by having hurricane fencing at least it shows that it's a bit it looks more temporary than putting out yeah and more permanent feats as well so anyway that's cool thanks for the update thank you and kiara thank you chrissy thanks for um all the work that you're doing and the way that you've you know outlined the issues that you're facing it's really helpful I'm just wondering um you talked about the fact that people were uh aware that the land was free and we're applying is there a really clear criteria about who can actually use the land and who is eligible we're the people's it's not so would that can apply um and I and my the way I look at the applications that come through lin's encourages anybody to come and use that land in a in a temporary way if they possibly can so um for for groups to get funding they need to if it's over five thousand dollars they need to be part of a incorporated group so but an individual can apply like with all the grazing messages those are individuals applying so there's there's no stipulation about who can apply um there's no need for those people to have any kind of track record about having done a project like this before so no it's a it's pretty it's pretty open right and again once council is doing it because of the connection with your community development advisors and your recreational advisors I think um there'll be a bit more intel about some of the applicants that will probably make it helpful right and that would be helpful too for the applicants to know you know there's no point in continuing because we well I would imagine I think you're getting on to difficult grammar right put criteria around who can apply and who can okay all right genuinely commercial um operations don't have any security of tenure so most of them see it's of temporary nature and look elsewhere anyway so there's a natural filter built in okay that's great thank you it's helpful are there any further questions if not there's some additional resolutions um up on the screen now that address some of the issues that uh chris has raised so the first one is on the adoption of the alt even on the other avon river corridor regeneration plan is a council plan giving some advice on that one it might whether we do that ahead of ahead of the the june cut-off potentially the transition plan and the work of the tetera kahikuhiku group getting some advice on that and working with lins to delegate decisions on transitional users to the council ahead of the land transfers to make those processes consistent make it much easier and clearer for the both through those processes do you have any concerns about those you're quite right too abc yeah I know chrissy used the term guiding document would that be a better term or was the plan I i don't know I don't know what the right term is I'm just wondering what's getting advice so you might call it something different in the advice okay yes it's currently called a plan yeah yeah but plans get confused with rma plan so yeah it's probably more of a policy document absolutely and so if we were to get advice that we could adopt it as a as a guiding document that would come back again for another minute okay that's right I welcome those additional resolutions I think two more would be good one is a d which is around advice on proactively releasing the reports and the second one is getting some advice on minimum standards of consultation and engagement with um the community over the proposals I'm just concerned that there's a bit of a gap with lin's and it just in the short term to try and just improve that so the delegation to our swarmlands would help with that we'll just get some releasing the um minutes could perhaps be redressed in the report that will respond to a bnc about the continuation of our group so we could address it in there but who I do we know brendan who owns the minutes whether it's us orlands or is that a combination yeah it's it's a wee bit opaque and I couldn't give you an answer right now I'll find out yeah okay so um there would need to be some work done on that so we could put up a resolution which asks um for some advice or some proactive work on on how to do that and then brendan can work through it yep okay so we've got some technical glitches again but these uh rudin going up um asking about the proactive release of the reports no minutes are out already the agendas the consultation stuff should be covered within the transition the advice on the transition well they're only giving six months now which is also too short for many groups chrissy would it be worth us asking them to extend that if they're not willing to delegate would that be useful for your group okay they can come through the transition stuff um strategy okay any further comments on those no do I have a mover mike second ml any discussion no in that case I'll put those all in favor please say aye any against to clear that carrie thank you very much thank you chrissy and I just want to acknowledge daemon um they manna anna and I were counsellors together we used to sit beside each other and try and keep each other under control you know that's great okay so thank you very much now we move to the community organization loan scheme application so welcome to the table sam and john so if you could just talk us through this briefly I know that there's been some questions through so if you're able to kind of answer those proactively for us that would be front of you the request is for 1.2 million dollars to allow the trust to restore the buildings as discussed the loan would be to the christchurch heritage limited which is a wholly owned company of the trust so it fits the criteria of the community loan scheme 100 our recommendation is for two loans to make that happen uh both of six hundred thousand dollars one is from the community loan scheme which would be charged at two percent the interest would be capitalized until the point would tenant the buildings in which case it's our assessment that they'll be able to service that um six hundred thousand dollar loan at two percent uh however they may not be able to service more than that hence this usage of the heritage building fund which sits on which is could be done as a loan at no interest because the money is sitting in the council as cash um so that that's the basis of the recommendation and happy to take questions around us thank you sam then mike thanks and thanks for sort of preempting lot one is the two percent interest rate on that have we looked at just charging I mean we don't borrow it anywhere near two percent for a lot of this stuff have we looked at just charging them a margin on our cost of borrowing so we had a paper to council um in november last year around setting the interest rate for the community loan scheme and that was sitting at two percent right now there has been other larger loans outside of that scheme that have been done at the cost of borrowing plus a small margin and we've done that the council's done that when they take out a specific loan to make that larger loan possible but loans from the community loan aren't done in that way it's done out of council's costs I don't want to dive too deeply into the council's financial operational systems but that loan is set at two percent to be able to cover cost of borrowing long term yeah and and be a um low-cost loan as per the intention of the interest rates were to go up over time do we effectively wear that hedging correct we do okay um and then just to delve in I mean I i agree with granting the lines you really don't want to I wouldn't stand like that I'm just trying to understand why we wouldn't pot I put interest on the heritage loan so two reasons one is uh that would create increased risk around the trust's ability to repay or could and certainly to service interest on that loan until the point where they sell the building that's our assessment and two the the heritage fund is cash we wouldn't be borrowing for it so that's the purpose of our recommendation so in terms of it being cash I'm just trying to understand how that exists when we have over two billion dollars of debt again we've been through yeah actually we've asked for a memo and some advice yeah I was just trying to do it in public rather than yeah yeah I think the uh the unequivocal advice that conservative is that uh loaning the trust 1.2 million percent at two percent uh they will have problems repaying and there's a risk that will set them up to fail now john the question was um how does this fund exist um when we've got so much debt um so maybe a bit of background that was given this morning on the sort of history of the fund and why it's still sitting where it is um I think carolyn is probably best placed to do that great thank you so the the um the fund um was set up to um purchase for council to purchase and on sale buildings that were at risk of demolition the fund has existed as far as we can um tell since probably the 70s and it has been used to purchase um buildings in the past the old government buildings the coachmen I think it was it was uh used as a facility in the methodist church at sydney and grub cottage we had under from that from a heritage perspective it doesn't exist inside the budget that corporate level we had assumed that as a result of the um the 2011 earthquakes and that the council looking at its finances then that that fund had effectively been um discontinued and absorbed into um the consolidated fund okay so probably so it was a surprise to us a that it existed and b that it existed as cash because we had assumed that it was always a loan facility right okay and probably the final question then if we're you know in the context of 1.2 million if we're concerned of twelve thousand dollars a year being an impediment on them their ability to service everything how comfortable are we in the entire ability to repay the loan the repayment of the loan really comes down to the ability to sell the building so the plan of the trust is to restore the building tenant it and then sell it because it's in their belief going to sell more successfully if it's tenanted so here's the structure of the loan so once tenancied we think they can service half that loan at two to make that sale it might not happen immediately so there's some time building yeah what can I just signal I'd be keen to amend number two and I can flick it through to aiden thank you so obviously I can see the reasons to okay I can see the reasons why that it's been split in two so and there's quite a big difference I guess one has um quarterly repayments at two percent the other one is paid at the end when the building sold with no no interest I mean a lot of that's obviously to enable the trust to actually be able to to meet some of the requirements therefore if if the historic buildings fund has a 850 000 wouldn't it be there for better um to actually put that loan up to 850 000 um and then reduce the the community loan to 350 to make it easier to service for the trust that could be an option uh the downside might be that it would fully exhaust that fund so which was which was used last yeah so cheer I'd just like to when we get to the point move something that actually adjusted those amounts just additionally to that thanks to my colleague john uh the two percent interest charge on on half of the total loan council providing felt like a fair uh middle ground and and was around the mark that we felt that they'd be able to service that loan until the building was sold um um do you want to then change mine so it doesn't put a specific value in there so that if mike's one comes through it just it applies to the regardless of the ratio or the proportion it's effectively just to add two percent to the interest on the heritage fund noting that at the end of it you know it's capitalized and it sorted at sale like the staff have talked about um yeah yeah that's I'm happy with that if it just if it speeds it up um so I'm just concerned that we had another heritage group come this morning and if we don't sympathy for the amendment that um counselor david's no no no I'm just trying to give you the context of the question while I've got sympathy for what's been put forward as an amendment I'm concerned about the impact on another public participation that we've had this morning can staff give us some sense of what the response has been to that because it would have seemed logical that this fund could have been used as a potential loan option for them as well the balance of the heritage building fund I can uh give you advice on that this is very high level and uh incomplete so I've I've met the group and uh in assistance with uh diane brandish discussed their finances and uh the group were requesting a uh a council contribution of five hundred thousand dollars a write-off of any uh uh development contributions and uh a write-off of a uh a council loan the uh our response was that uh in terms of the building heritage because the building had come down there was very very little the endeavor was to build another community center our advice was a community center is not needed in that location at that time primarily due to the proximity of other community centres the uh a council owned one across the street uh a center in sydney park and other developments nearby so I respectfully the uh the answer was not what they wanted to hear we then gave them advice and said if you'd like to discuss the issue with elected members make a deputation to this committee your best place to do it slightly ahead of the long-term plan and also make a submission in the long-term plan which is exactly what they've done our relationships have been very cordial very respectful but uh they uh it would be inappropriate of me to give definitive advice on something they've submitted this morning because I haven't seen that but that's a general tenor of the conversation that we've had today yeah so just just to follow up on that putting aside the requests for an additional grant just the clarification on the outstanding loan off or is that still on our box I can't answer in that level of detail the moment counsellor I need to go and compare an answer for that but in terms of heritage funding that could be applied to that loan balance right that loan was for a heritage bill no again I I'd have to go back and uh check I'd have to involve the heritage colleagues on that so can I just just clarify so we've requested advice um back on the public forum for this morning but the advice is that it wouldn't likely qualify for heritage funding but if they chose to they could apply for a community loan is that right um but it wouldn't qualify for heritage funding because there's so little of the heritage fabric of the building is is this the is this the uh presentation this morning yani was trying to work out whether he wanted more money left over in the heritage buildings fund yeah or not all I can say is that uh I think it would be wrong with us this morning that we haven't had the chance to fully discuss with our colleagues because this committee may use that information to influence decision making we're not confident that what we're giving you is robust or sufficient enough we haven't checked it so we probably prefer not to great thank you for those reasons yeah you've got a question for staff so you've obviously been working with the the trust not that one anna's one um and were they happy with your recommendation and they felt comfortable they could service that I'm not sure it's my place to answer I'm happy to um ask them um anna um are you happy with the current staff recommendation or would the the current sorry she said she was happy I think the trust is very happy to have the assistance of the council to be able to have a loan how are you how you uh allocate that loan is your decision my question is actually anna to for you paying 2 on the 600 000 as suggested are you happy with you thank you but if we can get it yes and another question for staff too if I may and that'd be john um there are often leading questions that's the intention um and also john um is there likely to be any other applications coming for this fund if we were exhausted today this is not for you anna this isn't john anna thank you very much if you could sit back now so john if we were to um john if we were to exhaust the fun today there'd be nothing left for another any other applications that came for that heritage fund is there likely to be any other applications sorry are you talking about the heritage or the community loans maybe carolyn should answer that one yeah so so brendan and I just had a um had a quick uh discussion we're not aware of anything um and we our recommendation would be that council should manage its existing heritage portfolio um well before it starts adding to its um its heritage portfolio yeah the report says that there's no um so mike you had a question did you want to it's unfair to call anna down again but if you can you opt use here do you also have a question well I had a question because she there was obviously a leading question about the the staff's recommendation um and we've actually moved something different um and I guess my question would be to the trust actually is is reduce keeping the same amount of 1.2 but then reducing the actual amount you have to pay back and quarterly installments um with interest a better outcome for the trust that's a leading question yes it certainly would be thank you and it would be much appreciated if that decision was made and that amendment was passed thank you thank you I'm happy with two leading questions not a problem okay are there any other questions for clarification of either the promotion or questions of staff can we see the whole motion yeah yeah but I can't see the phrase just thank you that's just in terms of how soon could we the sudden heritage trust because because that was used for heritage initially right I just want to get advice back and if we can get it today or in a tea break because although I've got sympathy for what my council davidson is proposing I do feel uncomfortable that we've got this unknown quantity of this loan that is possibly being able to pay be paid off by this heritage building fund okay so I'm afraid I couldn't give you an answer to that I'd have to go and and and have a uh I look to see where the uh uh where the information is the uh it's not the sort of thing I could uh commit to running away and doing by tea time so john just clarified process wise if if the council is asked to write off a loan do we need to find the funds from another fund or is it um written off within um the financial system so sam you might know that I don't know because there are a number of ways council can write uh uh for us we'd like to get some finance advice on that there are a number of different mechanisms depending on how the loan structured and the terms and the conditions I think there's always a lot of leeway in what we can do as council um so you may see that that has a bearing on your decision today um but we're not able to get that information for us today and I'd quite like us to be able to make this decision yeah and thank you just wanted to clarify with staff so are you saying that I hear you say that you feel um that it's better for us to put extra money into this now from the pot that with the cash pot that we've found um rather than um anticipate through the need so address what we need now so the trust the trust oh no I'm not necessarily commenting on that I think we've run we've we've outlined the pros and cons right of what's in the fund what it was for ability to repay and the decision sits with council right sorry I thought I heard staff say that they felt that we should manage our what we have already um well I i did I did say that the current council has a portfolio of heritage buildings and I think that um the advice from the heritage staff would be that managing that well would be the first step before you use this fund to to quite deliberately go and purchase a building at risk that would even temporarily add to that portfolio that would then mean that council would have to find funding to strengthen um bring up to build and code whatever was required for the building that you um you purchased you may purchase yeah thank you melanie and then jamie so you're not suggesting though that this heritage fund could be used for council buildings though are you no no no no that's good james thanks um I have read this in here but now I can't find it um how much is left in the community loan screen there is heaps isn term uh yes so if this grant is made there'll be about 900 thousand left in the yeah so I guess real simple question then now look they've come along to us with a community loan stream application 1.2 million dollars um why have we got all so clever with it when everyone's actually pretty on board with the fact that this qualifies for the community loan stream pretty well it's a good cause why don't we just give them a loan of 1.2 million dollars at two percent and then move on it's just it feels like we've got now two amendments and possibly a third for two reasons one is our assessment is that they cannot afford to service a one point two million dollar loan at two percent yet they made an application for one point two million dollars to the community loan scheme correct and when we receive an application we assess it for repayability and risk but they'll be charging market rentals will they not for the tenants on if if the restoration is completed with the our assessment is based on the rental valuation and the costs of trust etc is that two percent on 600 000 there's an appropriate risk level for them to service additionally 1.2 million dollars from the community loan scheme would be by far the largest loan from that scheme and would make up over one-third of the entire pot which is a really high kind of risk in terms of keeping that community loan scheme available to others to apply so we aren't comfortable giving community lines of that size okay anything further andrew just as a matter of um process can I note that if this fails I would be happy to foreshadow um moving the staff recommendation thank you that's fine okay so at this point we will move into debate and then we've got an amendment of sams which is one to include two percent scroll down two percent on the heritage buildings fund on the on the cash fund so we'll do the amendment first but we'll do we'll do one debate and then we'll move the amendment the foreshadow if needed okay so do I have any debate I'm just just really briefly look I've obviously put up an amendment today um just to effectively balance out the loan that's being provided the two percent over 10 years is actually a really good deal um for the organization and if you think I'm actually comfortable as well with the 50 50 split between so actually the staff proposal just with that interest being added and I think you do it for two reasons because the staff have clearly articulated uh that they can service the six hundred thousand dollar uh the they can they can service the six hundred thousand from the community fund over the 10 years and then they will settle the heritage fund at the other end um that makes perfect sense and I think the amendment will just strike a good balance between enabling the development that needs to occur um but at the same time protecting the rate payer at a minimal cost if you look at it it's twelve thousand dollars a year uh for the's three or four rate payers rates um and an award like mine so I just think we need to get that balance right and my amendment would do that so be great if people could support it thank you pauline then jake yeah well this this amendment here to the uh substandard puts me in a difficult position because um I'd I'm happy to support the original staff recommendation because I believe that it's a good uh balance I think it's a good recommendation and the the trust is happy with that and can manage that we've been told they can't manage the two percent on the other 600 from the heritage fund and I don't want to stress them out on that I don't see any point in exhausting a fund just because it's there either so I'm happy to support the original staff recommendation because I really do think this is an incredibly worthy project the work that's gone into this has been just amazing to watch and the end product is brilliant it's shaping that the trust can manage the staff recommendation of splitting it into two lots of 600 paying interest on one lot and not on the other so I'll be I'll have to vote against this one sadly but I'm not voting against the project itself so I want that to be clear it's an awkward position thank you jake following on from pauline I won't be supporting the amendment I think we should be doing everything we can to make it as easy and and and stress-free to protect heritage in our city I'm delighted to support the substantive moved by council davidson which is something I don't often get to say about something moved by council davidson and I just wanted to say that it'll be great to see these two buildings progress it's a slice of um history that will be maintained and not left and ruined and these two buildings are actually in an area of our cbd that has a lot of such history and it's going to be great to unlock this this city block you any further debate james thanks look I ironically I would have supported a 1.2 million loan from the community loans scheme at two percent interest like what was applied for um which sam's amendment uh results in however I'm going to vote against the amendment only because I think you need to be consistent with the purpose of those funds and historically there hasn't been interest charged on the historic buildings fund so I can't see how we can just start it now for for someone else I think you know that sets a dangerous precedent that um that halfway through uh a scheme that you you change the rules so I'll vote against this amendment but I think there's merit naturally just having that fund closed up so I'm probably leaning more towards supporting mike's amendment and then it can be done and dusted thank you any further um phil I sorry andrew then phil then in thank you um in my view what we've got in front of us is a sensible and pragmatic approach it allows the for the trust um and that sees interest rates on the community loan covering councils borrowing borrowing costs um on the matter of the interest for the on the heritage buildings loan so sam's amendment um or on the whole amount being paid from the community loan scheme the whole 1.2 million our draw council's attention to paragraph 4.1.2 in the report which clearly states um that the trust's ability to service the loan at that level is not there um we shouldn't be setting them up to fail and this paragraph in the report um certainly supports that and I'm very happy to take that advice um we've heard it several times this morning as well um it's the trust clear intention to sell the buildings once they're completed which will allow the heritage buildings fund loan to be repaid at that time and I'm pretty confident based on past projects that um we should be confident that that will occur so I don't support charging interest on the whole amount um and for that reason I don't to fail clause 4.1.2 makes it clear that that's what we would be doing if we went with a um scheme that charged interest on the whole amount so I'm pleased to support what's in front of us has been moved and seconded it provides the best support to getting these key buildings in a key site in the centre of the city completed and supporting the trust in their great work to do that I think it's important that we do acknowledge the work that the civic trust have done on other projects around town as well as these two buildings we're fortunate to have a group of this nature in town we lost a lot of heritage um some of it unnecessarily as a result of the earthquakes what we've got left is very important and I think it's absolutely right that we should put our strongest support behind what's here today that's the reason I'll be supporting what's in front of us thank you um phil uh andrews just more less said what I was going and echo I'll be uh supporting the original recommendations as well because I think it acknowledges the work that's been done behind the scenes which staff do to to build relationships with different groups they they see the big picture and say they come with recommendations with it from that understanding I think it also acknowledges and supports those who are passionate about preserving our heritage we don't uh we want to give them as we want it to make we want to make it as easy and workable for them um and it's it's about preserving our heritage which is what we're here to do this morning that's the point of this is actually to preserve our heritage for our future generations so I will be supporting the original recommendation anyone else before I do mine and then there's mike um so it's an amazing project and I've had a quick look through the work of the trust has been phenomenal and the goal of just saving the heritage um and not necessarily owning it but just having it'll be voting for what's in front of us but not the amendment and my issue with the two percent um on the heritage part of that is that actually it doesn't cost it it doesn't cost council anything um we're not having to borrow for it at this point and I um object to us trying to make money from a not profitable community group and so that's why I won't be supporting the amendment of adding two percent um to that even though it would be at the end of the time when the building is sold so with that I'll switch to um councillor davidson thanks I think everything's pretty much been sorry yeah I asked it before yeah continue mike pretty much everything's been said and um you know you could thoughts of councillor turn and turn around mclellan the reality is one of the things the good thing about this debate we're having is everyone actually agrees about supporting um these heritage buildings and actually funding or giving a loan to to the trust which try and put forward the best outcome we can for the trust to ensure that they have the best opportunity not to fail um yeah potentially I not supported the 600k split if no one fell over but you know you start creeping up there that increase the the risk I want to try and make it easy as possible for the trust we've done some fabulous work and they should be acknowledged when you look at manchester street you know there's a couple of buildings that stand out and that's because of the dedication and hard work of a number of people thank you and with that I will put the amendment initially which is to add two percent to the heritage component heritage fund component of the loan those in the amendment yeah there's only one amendment and then can I just have clarity around how we record concern at the quantum that might shifting so we'll do the amendment first and then we will move to the substantive but we need we do need to see the amendment okay anyway those in say aye any against I declare that last no no division thank you very much um any obsessions no okay in that case we'll move to the substantive um and what we might do at this point is just look at uh number one we have to do the whole lot and then you have to move the whole lot again that's fine there's a full sheet of motion to move the original staff recommendation okay all those in favor of the motions please say aye aye those against carried thank you very much yep that's fine so who hands up for those against um sam catherine james and pauline for different reasons I think yeah so I'll just have mine record against two okay and cancel your hands like is recorded against two good times okay before we have a quick break if we move to we're trying to get one more um paper done can I just have a quick um gauge from people is there likely to be much discussion on the submission on the submission no okay we'll go're here to talk about the climate change commission submission which council has prepared I'll just quickly uh run through the process for you um we got staff feedback from across units from parks transport um planning the policy team three waters and waste we then had a tuesday briefing with councillors we've had a very good session with the council's climate change working group in which we um incorporated feedback from councillors on the submission um we've also spoken to colleagues from some other councils that are making submissions um and also early conversations with lgnz and also fed back into the mural forum submission as well which I believe you've got a copy for overall we're asking for stronger ambition from the climate change commission in terms of their early budgets the key points really that the first three budgets they've set will not really get us on target to reduce to get us to the 2050 goal of net zero emissions for the country council itself's got a goal in 2030 to halve the emissions across our district but only about a 17 emissions reduction by 2030 which we believe uh leaves too much for future generations to kind of make up in the in the later part of the decades to come so we'll welcome any questions that you have on the submission thank you pauline and I'm sorry I didn't bring this up earlier but as you know I got dropped out of the email trail last week but I've got just a question on and it's page 55 on your plug-in electric hybrids and I have to declare an interest because I've got one but this is a bigger picture that um obviously you're supporting and incentives for people buying electric vehicles but you're recommending that they not offer them for hybrids because you can't guarantee that people are always going to use the electric side of it rather than petrol but my question is couldn't we have some recommended a gradual scale so a lesser incentive for plug-in hybrids because I don't think anyone would buy a hybrid intending to run it on fuel for us than our climate change targets so now a good question um I think it's all down to real world use and and the research has shown that particularly in fleets etc that they don't get used like they should be used they don't get plugged in a lot of them and there's potential um issues overseas where they have put incentives into plug-in hybrids where they've brought them for tax incentives and don't even plug them in it's a suggestion so you get a cheaper vehicle but you're not actually saving emissions in a lot of the cases some of the plug-in hybrids also in those links in the document no no kerry that was the link he doesn't he just turned them off don't touch is that right don't touch good so the evidence and there's a few links in there in the document around some of the evidence coming overseas that but um definitely yes in the past good transition who had utes at a battery electric good little transition like the mitsubishi there are battery electric um vehicles utes and other vehicles come in cars they here already good range so we do know with battery electric vehicles that it will be zero exhaust emissions with plug-in hybrids you just can't prove it with um likes of yourself you will be doing it but you can't across the board particularly with fleets evidence of showing that they're not all right with that clarifies it oh that's great any further questions on the submission no in that case oh so you wanted the the wording on the oceans stuff just you just raise the issue we haven't actually added that in but you're welcome to table any additional wording at this time because it was already on the agenda so um we could note it and then uh melanie and I can sign that off yeah is that all right could you talk to everyone else about it though so they're comfortable with that so we do it with the agreement of with the meeting it would have come through the office of the chief executive yeah I would like to talk about it because um I read an amazing article on the weekend about the importance of the ocean and sequestering carbon so three years of work has found by by a dozen ocean experts that um that they and they've also built the first global map of carbon stored in the sea floor and discovered that marine sediments store twice as much carbon as terrestrial soil and how important it is to actually protect our marine sanctuaries so that we don't have bottom dredging bridging up all this sea floor and being such a coastal country we've got a huge amount of coastline so we need to protect it so the extra wording that staff have suggested is that council notes new research on the importance of protecting carbon stores and marine sediment and suggests the carbon the commission investigate this further and include it in further advice to government large amounts of carbon stored in marine sediment is released when the sea floor is scraped during bottom trawling a process which also severely damages the marine ecosystem so we request advocate for the protection of sea floors as a way to both prevent the release of carbon stores and protect the marine environment if international agreement is reached an opportunity also exists to count the protection of marine areas as part of country's carbon savings under the paris agreement and I think that's fantastic wording and thank you very much for doing that so I'm hoping that the rest of the community were happy with that was that we know it up there thank you okay is there anything further from people no do I have a mover melanie am I any debate on this one I know it's been hours and hours of work for you all but thank you very much for all the work it's been really interesting I'm sure you want to say something similar yeah just briefly I think one of the cool things okay I think it's really good to see that we've actually put forward a very strong submission you know but I was reading the paper and it's quite right where professor brahma quite a strong submission we're consulting right now in a climate change strategy that potentially is not that ambitious so I really hope when we're actually saying this to to central government hey we need to be ambitious and strong when we get the feedback from our communities to be ambitious and strong and bold that we listen to them and actually do that too thank you for that I think one of the most important things in this submission is the fact that we are asking the climate commission to make sure that they put forward advice on our nationally determined contribution which is the contribution as a nation that we sign up for to through the paris accord um to be much stronger the advice from the commission is that it's not strong enough to actually meet our contribution our fair share for keeping the climate at 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and actually our submission goes a little bit further and says that but that's what we should be aiming for as a country for our nationally determined contribution not just net neutral and still not do our part to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees and so the climate change commission need to really focus on that 1.5 degrees and us doing our fair share making more cuts sooner um to make sure our planet is safe for future generations and with that I'll put the motion all of us in favor please say aye aye all right close against any abstentions carried thank you very much aaron would you get recorded put your diving mask put your diving mask on okay we will take a 10-minute break now so everyone back here at 10 past welcome back we're going to get started we've got quorum so we now move on to the art strategy implementation update um nigel if you're able to and nigel and kitty if you're welcome if you could um give us a quick talk through you know this had been a couple of questions through um so if you're able to talk to us about those that'd be great thanks thought I'd intend to go through start with a the report to go through if that's okay and then kitty you'll give a bit of no view of to tahi and then in terms of uh a brief briefing on what we've done so far so just wanted to clarify that in terms of 5.4 and turn it was supposed to say the 19th of february 2021 not february 19. we haven't been two years since the approval and principal so it was february um 2021 from the 19th that that happened the other one is just to highlight the importance of this being a co-created strategy so in terms of this was a co-creator with partners but for the ability for anyone and everyone to participate and be part of the implementation of torah to tahi so it's not a christchurch city council strategy that we're driving ourselves we're a partner to it but with others um and the other one intended to go through the figures that that are in this plan that were proved in principle by the partners in february in terms of the 130 000 that's rounds with those partners council's contribution to that is about twenty thousand dollars um which is in existing budgets and it's work that we already do that's been aligned to toatu tahi so just wanted to clarify that and that's on top of all the other work we've done and you would have seen by email this morning just as an overview some of the work plan that the arts team has going on and how they've aligned that to the outcomes um of toyota as well that's great thank you very much could be anything to add oh just um the work plan that we're developing that we had developed as a team in council is responding to the key priorities from the strategy and we are in a way redrafting that to bring the partners on board with to support the delivery of the strategy and that's the work that's underway at the moment with partners that's great thank you very much do we have some questions jimmy yes 5.4 I just want to know that you's under the action plan or implementation plan of art strategies part of them or separate so so in terms of the the agreement principle is aligned specifically to the art strategy so in terms of the funding from partners will contribute to in terms of delivery purely against otahi and this is in addition to what they already do so right for example creating already provide funding to the sector this is um over and above that but in a moment we have no least action plan in our right this strategy or implementation plan a moment we have no no this one we have an internal one that the arts team um deliver against in other parts of council of course are supporting the delivery of the strategy um we are working on a joined up plan and that's that's what's uh again current conversation with the strategy partners okay thank you thank you yani yeah thanks um I'm just looking at the document that we got sent through I presume is that the one that's coming out of the arts office this front of you is an indication of the the items that are in front of the different partners to be funded so in terms of when we talk about the funding of the communication plans websites community art participation huis workshops residencies and master classes and research and projects they are part of the things that the that was agreed in principle in february uh to be done uh what we're waiting for before that's actually confirmed is for each of those partners to go through their funding rounds to have the funding confirmed and committed and it's not just a 12 month it's over a period of of four financial years but three calendar years if you went through that so so things like for example where you list certain neighborhoods is key creative communities how do we have input into where those areas are so we're undertaking as an arts team at the moment some desktop analysis of what's happening where in christchurch because that's that's of use to us and it's of use to to communicating with citizens home um but we're also interested in those areas which have um perhaps a higher density of arts businesses or arts organizations and inactivity based and so we're just starting to look at what what they what those neighborhoods look like what's going on and what is attracting so we're at least like littleton cinema in new brighton is that an assumption that work will happen in those areas ahead of areas like wallston or um sumner or mount pleasant or wherever else the idea is that all neighborhoods uh included in the initial assessment of what's going on where so that we can map that because we don't have a comprehensive map of where activity is taking place what we're also noting though is that our initial analysis would be that there are areas where there are pockets of either activity and businesses established such as sydney and areas where there is some reputation or heightened activity or conversation between the arts community around those places for having a creative vibe perhaps okay and the other question I had was around natoi yeah we have a representative of manafenua participating at the the steering group level and we are working on on further engagement so that we develop a plan with the maori arts sector in particular so is there a sorry um for my ignorance but is there a specific group that's set up in terms of the maori sector or no no um there isn't one overarching group that that that we could go to and have that conversation um in the mighty arts sector I mean I mean I'm not on the committee that um you know the um te hongo committee but maybe maybe people want to raise it there who are on it and see how they can work together I i would have thought with things like the red house and all the other things that we're looking at so yeah you're starting to get quite a long way beyond the scope of the actual report today this was the document I got that was about what we were doing so that was additional to the actual report that's on would be really good for us to generally have an update on the broader um in in one place rather than um ad hoc I think so so rather than getting the detail today then is there a process for the actions that are proposed to come back to us for governance input and if so what would that be I've just asked for an update a broader update which we can have either a briefing session or something like that um on the arts implementation and it may be that we're able to have a look at we can't have a look at the um sorry the staff implementation plan that you're looking at and whether we need to formalize that I think you're missing the point so um so the strategy partners have agreed in principle to a plan right yeah what I'm trying to understand is at what point do we see the detail of that plan and have the ability to put things in or change things that is beyond the scope of today's report which is why I include that information right so there's no risk of agreeing to this today just then be told that the plan has already been agreed with our partners and we're unable to change it the purpose of today is to provide an update in terms of where we're at we're not asking we're not approving anything yeah we're receiving information this work is currently delegated to staff and so we will be getting an update at some stage soon so we'll make sure we book that in sorry if you go to 5.4 a meeting of strategy partners on feb nights was held staff presented a proposal for a three-year program of activity um and and so there is a proposal for work all I'm trying to understand is if when it comes back to us will it be too late for us to make changes to that program of activity or will we be within scope to do that in terms of to for that in terms of to go through what that's relying on is funding and commitment from the when I said at the start they searched for 130 000 towards the implementation of council's contributions about 20 000 so in terms of the partners and what they were committing to to do we can bring that back once that's confirmed and to let you know but in terms of our the council's ability to change what those partners have committed to will be limited yeah it's not our role to improve what other partners are doing in the art space no and to add to that part of the the question today I think also is once we have the funding rounds completed and we know exactly what's going to happen until at the same time we have some benchmarking work that's been complete at the moment it was funded by creative nz to actually be able to articulate what difference toyoto tahi has made to the creative sector in tahiti so we'll work through that and we'll bring that back so the intention is that there will be one report that will go to all strategy partners to the difference that's been made as opposed to a list of tasks that have been completed we actually want to have some benchmarks but just so clear we're being told what's happening we don't have any governance input into the priorities because what I've heard is we've got an agreed program and um our staff presented the proposal for a three-year program so you can say it's not just council it's our staff that did that program as governors we have signed off on the strategy so that is some high-level governance that we've given a direction staff have delegations and we are going to get an update you have heard this about four or five times now we will be getting an update on the stuff that you have asked for but it's not within the scope of this report today so do I have a mover yep thanks sam tim thank you very much any debate we've got to get out we've got to get out of just being told what's happening I mean honestly like some governance oversight of the implementation of those strategies in a position to know what's being done when what's not being done and why and what priorities are being put forward but at the moment for us to be told that a program of activity has been presented to our stakeholders to have had no governance oversight or input into that program and then be told that you'll just get an update and be told what's happening I just find that unacceptable I think you know as people that were involved in development of strategies and starting off on strategies as a council that it is our role at a governance level to look at how those strategies are being delivered and to have an ability to raise concerns around where the priorities are if things aren't happening or things are being redirected unfortunately I think um the the report in front of us today is asking us to agree to a program of work which we're now being told we cannot have any input into and and will only simply be given updates make decisions around funding priorities that will be something we could do on an individual basis as the applications come in but there are some wider issues in the arts sector that I think we should be absolutely turning our mind to so I can't support this today I support the intent of what staff are proposing but I do think that we should have had a briefing on the proposed program of activity and an opportunity at a governance level to provide them but it is clearly that our strategy has been signed off there are things that are not happening things that are delayed things that have changed and I think it's only fair that we have an ability to influence that thank you any further debate tim thank you I totally disagree I think that it's for us to partner with the arts community that's what we've instructed our staff to do that's what they have done I don't think any anyone around this table could really call themselves an artist um but I don't think well well yeah won't go there but I just our staff have gone to the community arts community they've gone in with an open mind they've gone there and talked with them and with regards to the meeting of february the 19th I just can't understand why this is just such an issue it's an issue by one person I think that it's great it's going to be good to hear from our community and the arts community are notorious for being divided in unity so let's just put it that way so I think our staff are doing the absolutely outstanding job there is never enough money in the arts there's always a lot of support but the money is an issue but um I think the staff have done an outstanding job trying to get them all together and move forward with our strategy and I look forward to the update as the chair has mentioned what five or six times now thank you anything further jimmy if we review the council the community outcome particularly regarding to the resilient other communities and recreation that's very very crucial you know to comply you know implementation and our resilient community I'm happy because council we adopt this kind of art strategy probably at least one year ago so the how to implement those strategies more effectively efficiently and can totally achieve our goal of our community outcomes very very crucial and important but at least today we are happy to listen to from the office you know feedback to us the this update status of the other implementation but still we can go more a better you know what is all the action plan implementation what is a time frame because I reveal those uh paragraph 5.4 in the 5.5 5.4 we emphasize for the next program and the three years activity about 5.5 we establish financials four years let's how about one more year where the funding uh come from that's my my particular concern even next time staff or office can flip us more clearly regarding the time frame regarding all those actions even pay pension plan give our overall picture not give us more confidence to no so all of those in favor of receiving the information in the report please say aye any against oh so I declare that carried kimber's record yanis vote against thank you very much right we now move to the heritage incentive grant approval for the new city hotel building I'll take the report as read but are there any um new bits of information or additional things you would like to add no are there any questions jake's happy to move tim second any questions in that case I will move to debate any debate andrew two words please support tim it's great to see this building and it's it's it's history it's kind of like the last one really standing at these old pubs and that's got such history with regards to the rooms and the stories etc so it's great to see it being supported to choose well I hope they're not going to make it too flash because I kind of like it the way it is but anyway I'll support it okay and favor please say aye any against I declare that carried thank you very much right now we move to um the heritage incentive grant for 82 billia's eliza's manner anything to add to this report no any questions are you having to move yeah mike's moving second melanie any debate no in that case I'll put the motion all those in favor please say aye any against declare that carried thank you very much okay and now we move to the heritage incentive grant for the why offense okay so james and pauline are moving and seconding this one uh do we have any questions from council no yes I just said the wire fence okay that's the question yeah okay um right and that has any debate pauline I'll never look at why offences the same way again I'll take far more notice in the future this was fantastic to see and I'd never thought of a wire fence being a heritage item but I just think it's fantastic so I'll be supporting this thank you very much jamie money on a wire fence it's the principle of this absolutely not yeah it's a wire fence though no as a matter of principle okay and with that I will put the motion those in favor please say aye those against no no division put your hands up just record it though hands up for recording against so counsellors davidson goff chu and mcdonald okay thank you very much thank you very much and now we move to the social housing update report thanks bruce okay could you just quickly run us through some highlights yep um so this is just a regular quarterly report um some of the key aspects and key changes um that have occurred either in the report or just slightly outside the period include we have completed the sale of the cecil courts complex which has released about 2.3 million dollars worth of funds that we'll be looking to reinvest back through the housing fund into the lifting the quality of other units so that's been very helpful there's been a significant amount of work done on on maintenance activities a significant amount of discussion and planning work with particularly our partner ocht but with other agencies around how we can continue building new social housing and one of the key things that we're working on is just doing some minor adjustments to the security arrangements for their properties that we've transferred to ocht which will allow them to borrow against those those properties that will be taken to the the delegates in this case the delegates of the chief executive and the chair of finance and performance to get approval for those those minor changes but if they succeed they will free up some funds and allow for a mortgage to be entered into to allow for further development I'll save the details on that because that really should be ocht making those announcements once they've got confirmation of all of those funding in places so I'll probably stop there um and uh open up for questions uh are there any questions not that yeah I just see with cecil course that it appears that the person that's acquired is just repairing them or there was no restrictions on what could be done no restrictions we left that up to the market our assessment was that to meet the needs that we have including the standards is going to cost too much to um to do that and with poor design outcomes that were there somebody else may have come to a different conclusion that's up to them we have taken the return and will be looking to improve other units that are better designed and provide a better long-term benefit to the community all right okay any further questions if not do I have a mover melanie secondar pauline is there any debate no nick wait haste I'll put motion those in favor please say hi okay thank you very much and mike can I call on you for a clear place thank you very much thank you everyone and please stay seated for the finance and performance briefing next you
Thank you very much and now we move to the social housing update report thanks bruce okay could you just quickly run us through some highlights yep um so um this is just a regular quarterly report um some of the key aspects and key changes that have occurred either in the report or just slightly outside the period include we have completed the sale of the cecil courts complex which has released about 2.3 million dollars worth of funds that we'll be looking to reinvest back through the housing fund into the lifting the quality of other units so that's been very helpful there has been a significant amount of work done on on maintenance activities particularly in the exterior of complexes we've also undertaken a significant amount of discussion and planning work with particularly our partner ocht but with other agencies around how we can continue building new social housing and one of the key things that we're working on is just doing some minor adjustments to the security arrangements for their properties that we've transferred to ocht which will allow them to the the delegates in this case the delegates of the chief executive and the chair of finance and performance to get approval for those those minor changes but if they succeed they will free up some funds and allow for a mortgage to be entered into to allow for uh further development I'll save the details on that because that really should be ocht making those announcements once they've got confirmation of all of those funding in places so I'll probably stop there and open up for questions uh are there any questions not that yani I just see with cecil course that it appears that the person that's acquired is just repairing them did we have anything that required them to be um demolished or there was no restrictions on what could be done no restrictions we left that up to the market our assessment was that to meet the needs that we have including the standards is going to cost too much to do that and with uh poor design outcomes that were there um somebody else may have come to a different conclusion and we'll be looking to improve other units that are better designed and provide a better long-term benefit to the community all right okay any further questions if not do I have a mover melanie secondar pauline is there any debate knock both hands I'll put motion those in favor please say hi okay any against no to clear that carried thank you very much and mike can I call on you for a clear choice thank you very much thank you everyone and please stay seated for the finance and performance briefing

We're trying to get one more um paper done can I just have a quick um gauge from people is there likely to be much discussion on the submission on the submission no okay we'll go to that we're here to talk about the climate change commission submission which council has prepared I'll just quickly uh run through the process for you we got staff feedback from across units from parks transport planning the policy team three waters and waste we then had a tuesday briefing with councillors we've had a very good session with the council's climate change working group in which we incorporated feedback from councillors on the submission we've also spoken to colleagues from some other councils that are making submissions um and also early conversations with lgnz and also fed back into the mural forum submission as well which I believe you've got a copy for overall uh we're asking for stronger ambition from the climate change commission in terms of their early budgets uh the key points really that the the first three budgets they've um to get us to the 2050 goal of net zero emissions for the country council itself's got a goal in 2030 to halve the emissions across our district but the budgets and the climate change commission's recommendations are only about a 17 uh emissions reduction by 2030 which we believe uh leaves too much for future generations to kind of make up in the in the later part of the decades to come so we'll welcome any questions that you have on the submission thank you pauline and I'm sorry I didn't bring this up earlier but as you know I got dropped out of the email trail last week but I've got just a question on and it's page 55 on your plug-in electric hybrids and I have to declare an interest because I've got one but this is a bigger picture that um obviously you're supporting feedbacks and incentives for people buying electric vehicles but you're recommending that they not offer them for hybrids because you can't guarantee that people are always going to use the is couldn't we have some recommended gradual scale so a lesser incentive for plug-in hybrids because I don't think anyone would buy a hybrid intending to run it on fuel the whole time and it is a transitional uh plus for us than our climate change targets so now a good question um I think it's all down to real world use and and the research has shown that particularly in fleets etc that they don't get used like they should be used they don't get plugged in a lot of them and there's potential um issues overseas where they have put incentives into plug-in hybrids where they've brought them for tax incentives and don't even plug them in this is a suggestion so get a cheaper vehicle but you're not actually saving emissions in a lot of the cases some of the plug-in hybrids also in those links in the document no no kerry that was the link he just he just turned him off so the evidence and there's a few links in there in the document definitely yes in the past good transition who had utes at a battery electric good little transition like the mitsubishi outlander no public publicity about that but things are changing there are battery electric um vehicles utes and other vehicles come in cars they hear already good range so we do know with battery electric vehicles that it will be zero exhaust emissions with plug-in hybrids you just can't prove it with um likes of yourself you will be doing it but you can't across the board particularly with fleets evidence is showing that they're not all right with that clarifies it oh that's great any further questions on the submission no in that case so you wanted the the wording on the oceans stuff just you just raise the issue uh we haven't actually added that in but you're welcome to table any additional wording at this time because it was already on the agenda so um yeah we could note it and then uh melanie and I can sign that off yeah is that all right could you talk to everyone else'd do it with the agreement of with the meeting it would have come through the office of the chief executive I believe so if you talk to people about it yeah I would like to talk about it because um I read an amazing article on the weekend about the importance of the ocean and sequestering um carbon so um three years of work um has found um by by a dozen ocean experts that um that they um and they've also built the first global map of carbon stored in the sea floor and discovered that marine sediments store twice as much carbon as terrestrial soil and how important it is to actually protect our marine sanctuaries so that we don't have bottom dredging bridging up all this sea floor and being such a coastal country we've got a huge amount of coastline so we need to protect it so the extra wording that staff have suggested is that council notes new research on the importance of protecting carbon stores and marine sediment and suggests the carbon the commission investigate this further and include it in marine sediment is released when the sea floor is scraped during bottom trawling a process which also severely damages the marine ecosystem so we request the commission suggests that the government joins international efforts to advocate for the protection of sea floors as a way to both prevent the release of carbon stores and protect the marine environment if international agreement is reached an opportunity also exists to count the protection of marine areas as part of country's carbon savings under the paris agreement and I think that's fantastic wording and thank you very much for doing that so I'm hoping that the rest of the people were happy with it up there thank you okay is there anything further from people no do I have a mover melanie and mike um any debate on this one um I know it's been hours and hours of work for you all um but thank you very much for all the work it's been really interesting I'm sure you want to say something similar yeah just briefly I think one of the cool things okay've actually put forward a very strong um submission um you know but I was reading the paper and it was quite right where professor brownwood hayward actually kind of called us out um for putting in quite a strong submission we're consulting right now in a climate change strategy that potentially is not that ambitious um so I really hope when we're actually saying this to to central government hey we need to be ambitious and strong when we get the feedback from our communities to be ambitious and strong and bold that we listen to them and actually do that too thank you for that I think one of the most important things in this submission is the fact that we are asking the climate commission to make sure that they put forward advice on our nationally determined contribution which is the contribution as a nation that we uh sign up for to through the paris accord um to be much stronger the advice from the commission is that it's not strong enough to actually meet our contribution our fair share for keeping the climate submission goes a little bit further and says that but that's what we should be aiming for as a country for our nationally determined contribution not just net neutral by 2050 we could get to net neutral at 2050 and still not do our part to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees and so the climate change commission need to really focus on that 1.5 degrees and us doing our fair share making more cuts sooner to make sure our planet is safe for future generations and with that I'll put the motion all over this in favor please say aye aye aye those against any abstentions carried thank you very much aaron would you like that recorded okay we will take a 10 minute break now so everyone back here at 10 past
Okay so thank you very much now we move to the community organization loan scheme application so welcome to the table sam and john so if you could just um talk us through this briefly I know that there's been some questions through so if you're able to kind of answer those proactively for us that would be great sure um thank you uh the loan reports in front of you the request is for 1.2 million dollars um to allow the trust to restore the buildings as discussed the loan would be to the christchurch heritage limited which is a wholly owned company of the trust um so it fits the criteria of the community loan scheme 100 uh our recommendation is for two loans to make that happen uh both of six hundred thousand dollars one is from the community loan scheme uh which would be charged at two percent the interest would be capitalized until the point would tenant the buildings in which case it's our assessment that they'll be able to service that um six hundred thousand dollar loan at two percent than that hence this usage of the heritage building fund which sits on uh which is um could be done as a loan at no interest um because the money is sitting in the council as cash um so that that's the basis of the recommendation and happy to take questions around us thank you sam then mike yeah thanks for that and thanks for sort of preempting a lot of those questions um just a couple so the first one is the two percent interest rate on that have we looked at just charging I mean we don't borrow it anywhere near two percent for a lot of this stuff have we looked at just charging them a margin on our cost of borrowing so we had a paper to council in november last year around setting the interest rate for the community loan scheme and that was certain at two percent right now there has been other larger loans outside of that scheme that have been done at the cost of borrowing plus a small margin and we've done that the council's done that larger loan possible but loans from the community loan aren't done in that way it's done out of council's costs I don't want to dive too deeply into the council's financial operational systems but that loan is set at two percent to cover cost of borrowing long-term yeah and and be a um low-cost loan as per the intention of the community loan scheme okay and then so just if the uh interest rates were to go up over time do we effectively wear that hedging we do okay um and then just to delve in I mean I look I agree with granting the lines you really don't want to I wouldn't stand like that I'm just trying to understand why we wouldn't pot I put interest on the heritage loan so two reasons one is uh that would create increased risk around the trust's ability to repay or could and certainly to service interest on that loan until the point where they sell the building that's our assessment uh and two the the heritage fund is cash the purpose of our recommendation so in terms of it being cash I'm just trying to understand how that exists when we have over two billion dollars of debt again we've been through yeah actually we've asked for a memo and some advice yeah I was just trying to do it in public rather than yeah yeah the unequivocal advice that we've received from our finance partners who admittedly are conservative is that loaning the trust 1.2 million percent at two percent uh they will have problems repaying and there's a risk that will set them up to fail now john the question was um how does this fund exist um when we've got so much debt um so maybe you could give a bit of background that was given this morning on the sort of history of the fund and why it's still sitting where it is um I think carolyn ingles is probably best placed to do that great thank you so the the um the fund was set up to um purchase for council to purchase and on sale buildings as far as we can um tell since probably the 70s and it has been used to purchase buildings in the past the old government buildings the coachmen I think it was it was used as a facility in the methodist church at sydney and grub cottage we had under from that from a heritage perspective it doesn't exist inside the budget that I manage it exists and is held at a corporate level we had assumed that as a result of the 2011 earthquakes and that the council looking at its finances then that that fund had effectively been discontinued and absorbed into um the consolidated fund okay so probably so it was a surprise to us a that it existed in b that it existed as cash because we had assumed that it was always a loan facility right okay and probably the final question then if we're you know in the context of 1.2 million if we're concerned of 12 000 a year being an impediment on them their ability to service everything how comfortable are we in the entire ability to repay the the ability to sell the building so the plan of the trust is to restore the building tenant it and then sell it because it's in their belief going to sell more successfully if it's tenanted so here's the structure of the loan so once tenanted we think they can service half that loan at two percent and then it may take who knows how long to make that sale it might not happen immediately so there's some time building yeah well can I just signal I'd be keen to amend number two and I can flick it through to aiden thank you so obviously I can see the reasons to okay I can see the reasons why that it's been split in two so and there's quite a big difference I guess one has um quarterly repayments at two percent the other one is paid at the end when the building sold with no no interest I mean a lot of that's obviously to enable the trust to actually be able to to meet some of the requirements therefore if if it be there for better um to actually put that loan up to 850 000 um and then reduce the the community loan to 350 to make it easier to service for the trust that could be an option uh the downside might be that it would fully exhaust that fund so which was which was used last yeah well it's a surprise to a lot of us so cheer I'd just like to when we get to the point move something that actually adjusted those amounts just additionally to that thanks to my colleague john uh the two percent interest charge on on half of the total loan council providing felt like a fair uh middle ground and and was around the mark that we felt that they'd be able to service that loan until the building was sold do you want to then change mine so it doesn't put a specific value in there so that if mike's one comes through it just applies to the regardless of the ratio or the proportion it's effectively just to add two percent to end of it you know it's capitalized and it sorted its sale like the staff have talked about um yeah yeah that's I'm happy with that if it just if it speeds it up um so I'm just concerned that we had another heritage group come this morning and if we don't have the advice back on that so while I have sympathy for the amendment that um council david's no no no I'm just trying to give you the context of the question well I've got sympathy for what's been put forward as an amendment I'm concerned about the impact on another public participation that we've had this morning can staff give us some sense of what the response has been to that because it would have seemed logical that this fund could have been used as a potential loan option for them as well the balance of the heritage building fund I can uh give you advice on that this is very high level and incomplete so I've I've met the group and uh in the group were requesting a a council contribution of five hundred thousand dollars a write-off of any uh uh development contributions and uh a write-off of a uh a council alone the uh our response was that uh in terms of the building heritage because the building had come down there was very very little left to constitute a heritage building the main purpose of the endeavour was to build another community center our advice was a community center is not needed in that location at that time primarily due to the proximity of other community centres the uh a council uh owned one across the street uh a center in sydney park and other developments nearby so uh I respectfully the uh the answer was not what they wanted to hear we then gave them advice and said if you'd like to discuss the issue with elected members make a deputation to this committee your best place to do it slightly ahead of the long-term plan and also make a submission in the long-term plan which is exactly what they've done our relationships have been very cordial of me to give definitive advice on something they've submitted this morning because I haven't seen that but that's a general tenor of the conversation that we've had today yeah so just just to follow up on that putting aside the requests for an additional grant just the clarification on the outstanding loan balance how much that is and have we written that off or is that still on our box I can't answer it in that level of detail at the moment counsellor I need to go there and answer that but in terms of heritage funding that could be applied to that loan balance right that loan was for a heritage no again oh yeah I have to go back and uh check I'd have to involve the heritage colleagues on that so can I just just clarify so we've requested advice um back on the public forum for this morning but the advice is that it wouldn't likely qualify for heritage funding but if they chose to they could apply for a community loan is that right um but so little of the heritage fabric of the building is this the is this the uh presentation this morning yani was trying to work out whether he wanted more money left over in the heritage buildings fund yeah or not all I can say is that uh I think it would be wrong of us to give this committee any more information on a deputation this morning that we haven't had the chance to fully discuss with our colleagues because this committee may use that information to influence decision making and we're not confident that what we're giving you is robust or sufficient enough we haven't checked it so we probably prefer not to great thank you for those reasons yeah you've got a question for staff so you've obviously been working with the the trust um not that one anna's one um and were they happy with your recommendation and they felt comfortable they could service that I'm not sure it's my place to answer I'm happy to um ask them um anna um are you happy with the said she was happy I think the trust is very happy to have the assistance of the council to be able to have a loan how you how you allocate that loan is your decision my question is actually anna to for you paying 2 on the 600 000 as suggested are you happy with that yes great thank you thank you very much thank you thank you but if we can get it yes and another question for staff too if I may and that would be john um there are often leading questions that's the intention um and also john um is there likely to be any other applications coming for this fund if we were to exhaust it today this is not for you anna this is a job thank you very much if you could sit back so john if we were to um john if we were to exhaust the fund today there'd be nothing left for another any other applications that came for that heritage fund is there likely to be any other applications sorry are you talking about the heritage or brendan and I have just had a um had a quick uh discussion we're not aware of anything um and we our recommendation would be that council should manage its existing heritage portfolio um well before it starts adding to its um its heritage portfolio yeah the report says that there's no intention to be using it for other things thank you um so mike you had a question did you want to it's unfair to call anna down again but if you can you opt to use her do you also have a question well I had a question because she there was obviously a leading question about the the staff's recommendation um and we've actually moved something different um and I guess my question would be to the trust actually is is reduced keeping the same amount of 1.2 but then reducing the actual amount you have to pay back and quarterly installments um with interest a better outcome for the trust that's a leading question yes it certainly would be thank you and it would be much appreciated if that decision you so I'm happy with two leading questions not a problem okay are there any other questions for clarification of either the motion or questions of staff can we see the whole motion yeah yeah but I can't see the place just that's good okay just in terms of how soon could we find out about the loan outstanding loan balance amount for the synonym heritage trust because because that was used for heritage initially right I just want to get advice back and if we can get it today or in a tea break because although I've got sympathy for what my council davidson is proposing I do feel uncomfortable that we've got this unknown quantity of this loan that is possibly being able to pay be paid off by this heritage building fund okay so I'm afraid I couldn't give you an answer to that I'd have to go and and and have a uh I'll look to see where the uh uh where the information is the uh it's not the sort of thing I could uh john just a clarified process wise if if the council is asked to write off a loan do we need to find the funds from another fund or is it written off within the financial system so sam you might know that I don't know there are a number of ways council can write off a loan this is probably not a question for uh for us we'd like to get some finance advice on that there are a number of different mechanisms depending on how the loan structured and the terms and the conditions I think there's always a lot of leeway in what we can do as council um so you may see that that has a bearing on your decision today um but we're not able to get that information for us today and I'd quite like us to be able to make this decision yeah and thank you just wanted to clarify with staff so are you saying that I hear you say that you feel um that it's better for us to put extra money into this now from found um rather than um anticipate through the need so address what we need now so then the trusted no I'm not necessarily commenting on that I think we've run we've we've outlined the pros and cons right of what's in the fund what it was for what it's doing and the impact on the their ability to repay and the decision sits with council right sorry I thought I heard staff say that they felt that we should manage our what we have already um well I i did I did say that the current council has a portfolio of heritage buildings and I think that the advice from heritage staff would be that managing that well would be um the first step before you use this fund to to quite deliberately go and purchase a building at risk that would even temporarily add to that portfolio that would then mean that council would have to find funding to strengthen bring up to build and code whatever was required for the building that you um you purchased you may purchase thank you melanie this heritage fund could be used for council buildings though are you no no no no let's go I'm just not good james thanks um I have read this in here but now I can't find it um how much is left in the community loan stand there it's heaps isn't it it's an excessive heaps is a nice term uh yes so if this grant is made there'll be about nine hundred thousand left in the yeah so I guess real simple question then now look they've come along to us with a community loan stream application 1.2 million dollars um why have we got all so clever with it when everyone's actually pretty on board with the fact that this qualifies for the community loan stream pretty well it's a good cause why don't we just give them a loan of 1.2 million at two percent and then move on it's just it feels like we've got now two amendments and possibly a third for two reasons uh one is our assessment is that they percent yet they made an application for 1.2 million dollars to the community loan scheme correct and when we receive an application we assess it for repability and risk but they'll be charging market rentals will they not for the tenants on if if the restoration is completed with the 1.2 million if they can find a tenant and then our assessment is based on the uh rental valuation and the costs of trust etc is that two percent on 600 000 is an appropriate risk level for them to service additionally 1.2 million dollars from the community loan scheme would be by far the largest loan from that scheme and would make up over one-third of the entire pot which is a really high kind of risk in terms of keeping that community loan scheme available to others to apply so we aren't comfortable giving community loans of that size okay anything further andrew just as a matter of um process can I um note that if this fails um I would be happy to foreshadow um moving the staff recommendation thank you fine okay so at we've got an amendment of sams which is one to include two percent scroll down two percent on the heritage buildings fund on the on the cash fund um so we'll do the amendment first but we'll do we'll do one debate and then we'll move the amendment and then go to the substantive and then potentially to the foreshadow if needed okay so do I have any debate I'm just just really briefly look I've obviously put up an amendment today um just to effectively balance out the loan that's being provided the two percent over 10 years is actually a really good deal for the organisation and if you think I'm actually comfortable as well with the 50 50 split between so actually the staff proposal just with that interest being added and I think you do it for two reasons because the staff have clearly articulated that they can service the six hundred thousand dollar uh the they can they can service the six hundred thousand from the community fund over the ten years and then they will makes perfect sense and I think the amendment will just strike a good balance between enabling the development that needs to occur um but at the same time protecting the ratepayer at a minimal cost if you look at it it's twelve thousand dollars a year uh for the interest on the six hundred thousand um you know that's three or four rate payers rates um and an award like mine so I just think we need to get that balance right and my amendment would do that so it'd be great if people could support it thank you pauline then jake yeah well this this amendment here to the uh substandard puts me in a difficult position because um I'd I'm happy to support the original staff recommendation because I believe that it's a good uh balance I think it's a good recommendation and the the trust is happy with that and can manage that we've been told they can't manage the 2 on the other 600 from the heritage fund and I don't want to stress them out a fund just because it's there either so I'm happy to support the original staff recommendation because I really do think this is an incredibly worthy project the work that's gone into this has been just amazing to watch and the end product is brilliant it's shaping up every day so um I do I feel comfortable that the trust can manage the staff recommendation of splitting it into two lots of 600 paying interest on one lot and not on the other so I'll be I'll have to vote against this one sadly but I'm not voting against the project itself so I want that to be clear it's an awkward position thank you jake uh following on from pauline I won't be supporting the amendment I think we should be doing everything we can to make it as easy and and it is stress-free to protect heritage in our city I'm delighted to support the substantive move by council davidson which is something I don't often get to say about something by council davidson and I just these two buildings progress it's a slice of history that will be maintained and not left and ruined and these two buildings are actually in an area of our cbd that has a lot of such history and it's going to be great to unlock this this city block for full protection and public immunity into the future thank you any further debate james thanks look I ironically I would have supported a 1.2 million loan from the community loans scheme at 2 interest like what was applied for um which sam's amendment uh results in however I'm going to vote against the amendment only because I think you need to be consistent with the purpose of those funds and historically there hasn't been an interest charge on the historic buildings fund so I can't see how we can just start it now for for someone else I think you know that sets a dangerous precedent that um that halfway through uh a scheme that you you change the rules so I'll vote against this uh amendment but I think there's merit probably leaning more towards supporting mike's amendment and it can be done and dusted thank you any further um phil I'm sorry andrew then phil then thank you um in my view what we've got in front of us is a sensible and pragmatic approach it allows the projects to be completed in a way that's affordable for the trust um and that sees interest rates on the community loan covering councils borrowing borrowing costs on the matter of the interest for the on the heritage buildings loan so sam's amendment or on the whole amount being paid from the community loan scheme the whole 1.2 million I'd draw council's attention to paragraph 4.1.2 in the report which clearly states that the trust's ability to service the loan at that level is not there we shouldn't be setting them up to fail and this paragraph in the report um certainly supports that and I'm very happy to take that advice um we've heard it several times this morning as well it's the trust clear intention to sell the buildings fund loan to be repaid at that time and I'm pretty confident based on past projects that um we should be confident that that will occur so I don't support charging interest on the whole amount and for that reason I don't support the amendment we shouldn't be setting them up to fail clause 4.1.2 makes it clear that that's what we would be doing if we went with a scheme that charged interest on the whole amount so I'm pleased to support what's in front of us has been moved and seconded it provides the best support to getting these key buildings in a key site in the centre of the city completed and supporting the trust in their great work to do that I think it's important that we do acknowledge the work that the civic trust have done on other projects around town as well as these two buildings we're fortunate to have a group of this nature in town we lost a lot of heritage some of it unnecessarily as a result of the earthquakes what it's absolutely right that we should put our strongest support behind what's here today that's the reason I'll be supporting what's in front of us thank you um phil andrews just more or less said what I was going to say okay thank you very much short and sweet and echo I'll be uh supporting the original um recommendations as well because I think it acknowledges the work that's been done behind the scenes which staff do to to build relationships with different groups they they see the big picture and say they come with recommendations with it from that understanding I think it also acknowledges and supports those who are passionate about preserving our heritage we don't we want to give them as we want it to make we want to make it as easy and workable for them um and it's it's about preserving our heritage which is what we're here to do this morning that's the point of this is actually to preserve our heritage for our future generations so I will be supporting the mike um so it's an amazing project and I've had a quick look through the work of the trust has been phenomenal um and the goal of just saving the heritage um and not necessarily owning it but just having it there for the city is is admirable I'll be voting for what's in front of us but not the amendment and my issue with the two percent um on the heritage part of that is that actually it doesn't cost it it doesn't cost council anything um we're not having to borrow for it at this point and I object to us trying to make money from a not profitable community group and so that's why I won't be supporting the amendment of adding two percent um to that even though it would be at the end of the time when the building is sold so with that I'll switch to council davidson thanks I think everything's pretty much been sorry yeah I asked it before yeah continue mike pretty much everything's been said and um you the reality is one of the things the good thing about this debate we're having is everyone actually agrees about supporting um these heritage buildings and actually funding or giving a loan to to the trust which is really good my my motion is really just to try and put forward the best outcome we can for the trust to ensure that they have the best opportunity not to fail um yeah potentially I not supported the um 600k split if my one fell over but you know you start creeping up there that increase the the risk I want to try and make it easy as possible for the trust I've done some fabulous work and they should be acknowledged when you look at manchester street you know there's a couple of buildings that stand out and that's because of the dedication and hard work of a number of people thank you and with that I will put um the amendment initially which is to add two percent to the heritage component heritage fund component of the loan those in the amendment yeah there's around how we record concern at the quantum that mike's shifting well that will be when you I can't see it on the screen so we'll do the amendment first and then we will move to the substantive but we need we do need to see the amendment okay anyway those in favor of adding two percent um with the amendment please say aye any against I declare that lost no no division thank you very much um any ascensions no okay in that case we'll move to the substantive um and what we might do at this point is just look at uh number one we have to do the whole lot and then you have to move the whole lot again that's fine there's a full shadow motion to move the original staff recommendation yeah okay all those in favor of the motions please say aye aye those against carried thank you very much yep that's fine so who hands up for those against um sam catherine james so I'll just have mine record against two oh okay and cancel okay
Uh so now we move to item seven uh the minutes of titakuhiku and welcome chrissy williams thanks so much for coming along chrissy thank you it doesn't feel like it was three months ago does it flies by um just thank you to aiden for um having those slides ready to go um and and and as I can I don't know um as I start presenting the minutes for the last three months I just really want to acknowledge the staff that support us so we have um brennan winder here in the city in central in this building as red zone manager but also the staff at shirley seven center who provide um supports and reports the reports that we get so um just really want to acknowledge them so um we've tried to minimize my presentation today by including in the report some summaries which I think presented as powerpoint last time of the leases and licenses that we've made recommendations to linz about um presentations we received and grants from the um for the redzone transformation transformative fund so you can in that the front report that you have we have also deferred a couple of recommendations where we think that we one we need more information about or we consider that the site that the applicant has applied for is not appropriate for what they want so we've suggested they go back and talk with lindsey and the city council to see if there's an alternative site within the red zone that that they could use the other thing we're noticing about applications is that they're coming through because the land is effectively free for people we seem to be getting applications that I would question whether they really need to be in the red zone so um that's I think a question that should be asked early on in the process you know why why do you need to be in the red zone I mean for example I think we might be going to see one about a show home so does that need to be in the red zone or could it be somewhere else but the land is effectively free and time goes on especially for commercial type of operations whether that land does continue to be free for lease um so I've just got three issues I thought I'd raise with you today one is that an um in a meeting we had with lin's in december that um a subgroup of the kahika and the city council they told us that they were going to limit leases to six months so this is an anticipation of the land being handed over to council I don't think it will be handed over in six months I'll be I think we'll all be surprised if blinds have got all the 29 um sub bits of land ready to hand over but what they are then saying is to people whose proposals are for longer than six months to go through to council for their application so two things I think arise from that one is that the council needs to be ready you you consider the policy in november um for how council will process applications so they've got the policy sitting there but is used so that people can can apply to council and be considered for transitional and possibly permanent uses so that needs to be ready and there has been some discussion I think but I think it would be good to progress this is is that the council negotiates with linds maybe with the minister um so that just the decisions on transitional land uses can be taken from london delegated to the city council for the next x months because at the moment it's incredibly messy for um proponents they don't know whether to go to london's whether they don't know whether to go to the council lindsay really pro only considering transitional uses though many of the applications are effectively permanent uses so um I you know I think that's that may be underway but I think it would be good to expedite that um the second item that's being discussed a lot with people in the community is around the long term governs so I know there's a lot of work happening on this and some of us have been it's unlikely to be in place before december and maybe even take longer than that so it's important that um for your policy to work that te kahikuhiku continues um the terms of reference did set it up for three years but not all the appointments are in place for that so I think you'll be receiving a report from staff on ensuring that and because of the late start of the group mostly because of covert the two-year budget has only been partially spent so I think there's a proposal in the draft for for in your draft ltp to carry forward the the surplus budget so that um she has got some funding to to operate and also to to grip make grants from so just letting you know that it'll be hidden somewhere in the ltp it's a tiny amount compared with what you're mostly considering and I think just a reminder that you know there's a lot of talk about the co-governance group but for it to work you're really going to have to consider and be that I know that can will be really hard um but also to provide significant funding to provide staffing and money for them to do some work so it's not just setting up the co-governance group there's a lot of sort of think policy thinking and funding thinking just that beside behind it and then the last issue um and you should recall that the greater christchurch regeneration act um 2016 was amended last year um but the parts that are relevant to regeneration plans and recovery plans are planned will be revoked on the 30th of june this year so when this canterbury earthquake recovery act moved across to the greater christian regeneration act in 2016 all the recovery plans in place were carried forward so the littleton port recovery plan the lerp um the chris central recovery plan or whatever its name is I always get the names wrong about the cranford basin recovery plan so all those got carried forward and since then the um the otaku avon liver corridor regeneration has been um developed under the greater christ future regeneration act um you'll the provisions to for the region plan have been inserted into the grace register plan so there's a section um for the special purpose of otakura avon river corridor in the district plan so the district plan really does say what the recovery regeneration planners want him to achieve but I and just um just and thinking through this I mean I think council has accepted that and looking at your submission to the amendment last year is that um you don't feel a need for those regeneration recovery plans to continue because they have been inserted in the district plan mostly but I think it would be really helpful for for you and for us if the regeneration plan was somehow taken on board as a council I don't know whether it's a policy strategy plan you mean your staff can work out what you would call it but that all the work that went into this isn't lost because the district plan what's in the district plan is very sort of rules based whereas this is more about intent and visions helpful rather than trying to seek legislation to continue it that you somehow take it on borders as your plan and you may want to think about some of the recovery plans I don't know whether staff have done the analysis of if there's anything still useful in those that isn't in the district plan um that you might want to consider adopting some of those recovery plans as as your plans as well so um and that's probably getting a little bit outside my mandate but you know having worked on these for the last um x years I think it's important that all the work that went into them isn't isn't lost by the revocation of a other regeneration act um yeah so that that was all I wanted to raise with you so the sort of pretty meaty um issues probably more than the sort of the day-to-day work of of the our group but they do pertain to our ability to be effective um and having plans in place and having that that um knowing that there's going you madam chair that's my presentation happy you can ask a question thank you christie um so we do have some questions yeah um thank you very much chrissy just looking at the the minutes and the granting of temporary lease for grazing um the finns and our port hill rangers have the biggest concern about where urban meets rural and so I just wonder in those lease agreements and I know that only for a short time to may 2021 because of the trends hopefully the transfer but if not there's if there could be something in there just with regards to um keeping the grazing down because I know that our ranges are over grazing at the moment to keep everything down and safe and it doesn't seem in the four points mentioned there doesn't seem to be any anything mentioned there so I just wonder in the future if you that could be of a an issue that you'll notice that we've also um further down in that those minutes we've um we've agreed that any grazing applications in river corridor really um would be a staff delegation so they won't even come to our group okay because you know we're talking about avocado valley mostly where they've been um they're single single site sections and the staff have to put a huge amount into each report for grazing that just you know we don't even discuss it just goes through so it becomes an operational matter and um I think that the ability to discuss with the people about um how much grazing happens to keep the grass down you know probably sits with brendan moore so he's not suddenly appeared beside me thank you yeah I just wanted to just raise it cool thank you thanks I think anything to add brendan uh no I take your point though um the the grazing is deliberately done in those areas to deal with the fire risk so it's not explicitly in the uh in the lease agreement that's a implicit requirement we're certainly checking on it so there shouldn't be any issues but we'll talk about changes interested in um several I guess high level points um one is um I've noticed that we get the minutes but I've been told that I have to go through lagoima to actually get the reports of the agendas of the meetings and it seems a very non-transparent way to kind of provide information I wondered if the committee had considered like we do at council releasing things when there's no you know having a proactive system to release the applications and the information in the report um like the agenda reports um when it when it's able to do so rather than waiting for people to to lodge I'm not even sure we're subject to nagoyama actually but um it's probably I think we're official information I think that's part of um the transition and again we might want to add to this is that when council council's policy that you agree agreed to in november um includes publicly advertising applications that have come in for two weeks so people can make comment on them so the council's so um I i think that's a real opportunity for we then to consider whether the reports that come to our group then do become public even before we consider them but um or even after you like we often do but after you consider them then have a process to actually have them released yeah and we may need to redact um some personally confidential promotion but I think some of the built-in uh delay there is to do with the lin's involvement so the sooner we have it's streamlined that's going to make the whole process easier right and the second question high level was where activities impact on a neighbouring property and a private owner not not a public owner what's the process to engage with them is there a process where they're involved in in sort of being able to provide feedback or being aware of what's proposed and the impact on them is really adamant that there needs to be consultation um with both neighbors but also neighbouring communities before the lease is granted again um lin that once it comes over to council I think that will be easier we we have had some discu our staff have had discussions with lin's about advising proponents about what kind of consultation would be necessary depending on the level of their application like some things are an event and and some things are quite quite long term so um but yeah there's definitely that requirement there's also the requirement about um consultation with manafenua and we've cut we've got a hierarchy um established with manifeno for that so that people don't have to go again if it's for something so just to be clear at the moment there's no requirement because it's latins but when it comes to council there will be a requirement and our recommendations we we usually we try and say that there should be consultation before the leases is granted um but how what how that eventuates is really hard to know so some people do a letterbox drop some but that some some of the applicants don't add even aware of residents associations or link them with the right people and we haven't_''_851.68 we haven't had a lot of success with that so um andrew and I'm aware that we've recommended this in consultation it hasn't happened final question is a bit more specific but on number six on the um february 2021 report third of february the temporary land use application for the moon river flower garden and it states that it's um that it doesn't fully align with the regeneration plan and the initiative is commercial um in nature and then I noted there was quite a split in the vote can and then there's some discussion about the fence can you can you just kind of give us some sense of something like that um why that's been approved and you know again like with fencing going on to neighbouring property what the process is I don't know why the concern was raised about the fencing but I was interested in that in that in terms of the people around it having some input and whether they did so it's on the edge of the of the um red zone right on the edge of the green spine um it does require fencing for security reasons so the split in the group was about one being in the greens and the green spine and one about it um being fenced in and excluding public from that area because those are really strong intense for most of the applications for most of the people in the group for the applications um this one went through because it was on the edge it's it is of temporary nature um that land is is um and the regeneration plan is set set down as a stormwater management area so it can't stay as a garden for the whole time so it was because of um knowing it was temporary that that the consensus well it wasn't even the consensus in that stage we couldn't reach consensus the vote was that um we did to continue with it so um there was quite a lot of community participation in anticipated in the application involving um school groups and early childhood and things like that so it wasn't just a commercial operation and although it's called commercial I would say it was probably an it's not a not-for-profit but I wouldn't have been making you know wouldn't have been a really highly profitable venture so and we try and work under consensus um it's a you know 13 people you know what it's like to try and find some kind of middle ground um especially when it's in the green spine because we have quite you know we do have extreme views but it felt that it was going to activate the area and because it was on the edge it um it wasn't going to impact on people's access too much if they had any chance to provide import whether there was any discussion with neighbours about what type of fencing went in but I saw that that was something that that committee discussed and I wasn't quite sure why they discussed it or what it was discussed by us to say that my mum if I'm wrong on appropriate fencing the original fencing uh proposal was uh 1.8 metre wooden pale fencing which would have provided no ability for anyone to see and or so yeah that was from I think I understand from a security perspective they wanted that the applicant then went to our team leader to talk about having hurricane fencing which was seen around the city there which enables the community to see what's going on it's far cheaper and helps activate that area so if we put everything behind that fence it kind of reduces the benefits of the community of seeing these beautiful flowers and growing in the garden so that was where the advice came from whether or not the fencing material to be used was discussed with the neighbors I don't know I suspect probably not I mean it seems like a pretty sort of normal thing you do if you're putting up fencing you talk with the neighbor on the boundary you would certainly only if you're asking them to pay for it yeah okay that's fine thank you and by having looks more temporary than putting up a more permanent fence as well so anyway that's cool thanks for the update thank you anne thank you thank you chrissy thanks for um all the work that you're doing and the way that you've you know outlined the issues that you're facing that's really helpful I'm just wondering um you talked about the fact that people were uh aware that the land was free and we're applying is there a really clear criteria about who can actually use the land and who is eligible where do people it's not so would that be helpful to have a much clearer criteria well anybody can apply um and I and my the way I look at the applications that come through linds encourages anybody to come and use that land in a tree in a temporary way if they possibly can so for groups to get funding they need to if it's over five thousand dollars they need to be part of a incorporated group so but an individual can apply like with all the's no stipulation about who can apply um there's no need for those people to have any kind of track record about having done a project like this before so no it's it's pretty it's pretty open right and again once council is doing it because of the connection with your community development advisors and your recreation advisors I think um there'll be a bit more intel about some of the applicants that will probably make it helpful right and that would be helpful too for the applicants to know you know there's no point in continuing because we don't fit this criteria that would be helpful as well I would imagine I think you're getting on to difficult grounding right criteria around who can apply them who can't okay all right genuinely commercial operations don't have any security of tenure so most of them see it's in temporary nature and look elsewhere anyway so there's a natural filter built in okay that's great thank you it's helpful are there any further questions if not there that address some of the issues that uh chris has raised so the first one is on the adoption of the alt even on the other avon river corridor regeneration plan as a council plan giving some advice on that one uh it might whether we do that ahead of um ahead of the the june cut off um potentially um the transition plan and the work of the tetera kahikuhiku group getting some advice on that and working with lins to delegate decisions on transitional users to the council ahead of the land transfers um to make those processes consistent make it much easier and clearer for the both the group the council and for the community to work through those processes um do you have any concerns about those you're quite right to abc yeah I know chrissy used the term guiding document would that be a better term or is a plan I don't know I don't know what the right terms yes I'm just wondering what's getting advice so you might call it something different in the advice okay yes it with rma plan so yeah it's probably more of a policy doc but absolutely honestly and so if we were to get advice that we could adopt it as a as a guiding document that would come back again for another minute okay that's right I welcome those additional resolutions I think two more would be good one is um a d which is around advice on proactively releasing the reports and the second one is getting some advice on minimum standards of consultation and engagement with the community over the proposals I'm just concerned that there's a bit of a gap with lins and it would be good to try and even if it's just in the short term to try and just improve that so the delegation to us from london would help with that we'll just get some releasing the minutes could perhaps be redressed in the report that will respond to abnc about the continuation of our group so we could address it in there but literally do we know brendan who owns the minutes whether it's us orlands a wee bit opaque and I couldn't give you an answer right now I'll find out yeah okay yeah so there would need to be some work done on that so we could put up a resolution which asks for some advice or some proactive work on on how to do that and then brendan can work through it should okay so we've got some technical glitches again but there's a wooden going up um asking about the proactive release of the reports no minutes are out already the agendas and I'm um and the only the uh the consultation stuff should be covered within the transition the advice on the transition and all the work that's happening from now it just seems weird well they're only giving six months now which is also too short for many groups chrissy would it be worth us um asking them to extend that if they're not willing to delegate would that be useful for your group okay they can come through the transition stuff okay okay any further comments on those no do I case I'll put those all in favor please say aye any against clear that carried thank you very much thank you chrissy and I just want to acknowledge damien um damanna anna and I were counsellors together we used to sit beside each other and try and keep each other under control you know that's great well it was just me keeping cell phones and laptops
Okay any uh so there's no presentation of petitions that's all good and uh so now we move to item seven uh the minutes of tita and welcome chrissy williams thanks so much for coming along chrissy thank you it doesn't feel like it was three months ago does it flies by
Okay um and next we move to deputation from the christchurch heritage charitable trust so welcome anna and shawn and this relates to the community organisation loan scheme report on today's agenda mr cross nice good morning councillors I'd like to introduce I'm anna crichton I'd like to introduce my team sean stockman and chris houseman trustees of the christchurch heritage trust and I'm chair of that trust I'm not going to say a lot excellent report in front of you it's detailed it's got everything on it that you could possibly want and I'm very pleased that of the high standard of that report it's it's it's really good so thank you to staff for that I just want to say two things there's an image up on the screen and that's shan's that's how we found it now shan's is a loved building in central christchurch now how many private investors would take that on and restore it move it somewhere else and restore it not many not many at all had it in and now it's fully restored earthquake strengthened fire sprinklers in it and ready to go the other slide I would put up is the interior of trinity now this is a beautiful beautiful timbered vaulted ceiling that is not seen anywhere else in that iteration anywhere architecturally within probably the southern hemisphere and this building was two weeks away from being demolished so what I'm saying to you is the christchurch heritage trust saved these two buildings for the city of christchurch because that's our objective that's our mission to save heritage for the people of christchurch as tangible reminders of our past we are a non-profit charitable trust and that is why we have come to you for a loan so that we may finish the work that we've already invested in these two buildings I think that's all I need to say but um I'd be very happy to take questions from you should you have any thank you thank you do we have any questions from people no just like that thank you very much um and um today so if you stick around that'd be wonderful thank you thank you okay any
Thank you very much and now we move to the public forum so welcome we've got uh two groups today who get five minutes each for public forum to raise issues so the first one is the on barrington mall so jill kearns welcome you to the table thanks very much for coming along today and raising this for us dear counsellors today I'm presenting you with a suggested bylaw for your consideration which I have outlined below the intent is to eradicate the ongoing issue with beggars lingering and basing themselves on council property the recommendation is for council to put in place a bylaw whereby no begging can take place near or at public entrance to businesses and all council owned community facilities the main reason for this bylaw to be introduced are public health and safety allowing the community to enjoy our community facilities without being harassed intimidated or verbally abused the eradication of potential traffic incidents involving members of our community general safety of our community and likewise the safety of the individual bigger beggars thank you thank you very much and I know so that's really important I do have any questions got time for one question thank you thank you for your presentation and realize that it's an ongoing issue for you and I see that gary's sitting with you so I'm wondering if you've had conversations about how this is being approached in the inner city gary and I have actually spoken um because it is a problem actually christchurch-wide today I'm I've got two hats on I've got my hat on as a a member of our community but also I am the centre manager of barrington shopping centre and I see this being an issue right across the city at every shopping centre but also um other strip shopping as well so gary and I used to have spoken about it it's a growing issue that's great now that we do have the time up there is there is a bit more time so mike look thanks for your deputation and obviously we're seeing issues of anti-social um behavior my question is actually not to you it's places by-law we made a resolution in there to actually request staff to investigate a regulatory mechanism in regards to anti-social nuisance behaviour and I just haven't heard any update of what happened to them that was actually a number of years ago so I'd sort of like to know because that's if we had that tool you know in our tool kit we may be able to do something actually where there is a nuisance behaviour actually occurring um so I'm just wondering if we can get an update on actually that resolution that was passed by council a number of years ago so I would probably have to go back and check um it may have been um the proposal that when paul lonsdale was a councillor um no no no it was down here it was the hearings panel that I cheered so it was last term um and it was passed by council to actually investigate this um but I haven't seen any update of actually what happened with with either I would chase it up with policy not sure where for jill or a question for staff um well uh probably probably both but just probably the first to gel um thank you for the deputation have you contacted the police and if so what's their response been uh I've exhausted we've exhausted all avenues I look um our shopping centre is privately owned so the so the whenever we have a beggar we trespass them from our property our property is not the issue it's the issue out on the footpath and all other council facilities that's why I'm seducing this bylaw because at the end of the day the police cannot enforce anything until you pass a by-law because legally they are not doing anything wrong the problem being is there's probably a dozen or so people they are not homeless unfortunately they're feeding a habit they're not very nice people and we don't want these people in our community doing what they're doing why should we have to put up with it they're saying they're homeless and they need food but actually they're city we all know that it might be helpful to get uh like where they actually are where they are are they well the police have actually have known they know exactly where they are they know the people they know what they do they do a circuit of the city they have someone drop them off in a car the the police have all that information okay so we will take this offline because we've got to the sort of the end of the not enough time for a full question and answer and we've got some other constraints this morning yeah um so gary you'll chase up on the absolutely the regular thing that um counselor davidson talked about and um and if you want to send something through I i just think I'd like to suggest that we have a briefing to actually look at this together as a as a city-wide issue and look at what's actually happening what we are doing and what we can we'll take it offline can we that would be great thank you thank you next up we have the sydney heritage trust so we've got david rankin coming to speak and people have been given a an a3 piece of paper and some other bits and pieces with some information from the trust there so welcome unfortunately it's only a five minute um slot but we do have a lot of additional information too so if you'd like to sort of highlight the key points that you're really keen to make today thank you very much um good morning I'm david rankin and I've been authorised by the trustees presentation and I'm supported by chair dorothy hello trustees on the 27th of april 2001 the trust was formed in cooperation with the council to restore the former heritage church which was acquired by the trust in sydney with the support and assistance of the council including a mortgage of four hundred and twelve thousand five hundred dollars in an email date of the 18th of october councillor sue wells stated good news the church is insured and that was 2010 she also stated the loan has been does not expect payment for it but if the property was to be sold for example the loan would have to be repaid history shows that the church was demolished without authorization following the 2011 earthquake after the trusted spent considerable funds on restoration and much work including re-roofing of up over 750 thousand dollars the insurance was arranged by council through its associate civic insurance which proved to be totally inadequate providing an insurance settlement of 334 000 plus gst which was paid to council as mortgagee funds from this have been made available to the trust to help with the site clean up and saving of stonework and historical items leaving just over 206 000 available in credit on the 11th of march last year the trust wrote to the council requesting financial support of 500 000 spread over two years to release the insur and to release the insurance funds held and to waive council charges to help facilitate the erection of a replacement building to go on the site for a museum meeting room plus cafeteria incorporating original stonework and stained glass windows I think you and provided provides an exciting opportunity to create an entrance statement for the commencement of the main sydenham commercial area as set out in the project rationale provided your support for this project is a continuation of the partnership established between council and the trust in 2001. this project if one looks at the objectives of this committee would provide a strong sense of community active participation in civic life safe and healthy communities celebration of our identity through arts culture heritage sport and recreation valuing the voices of all cultures that could be made available to all in all ages and it would be building as part of the strategic priorities enabling active and connected communities to assist with their future we have a lot of support for this project and free engineering and we believe that the amount that's being requested of council to help facilitate this project is a very small amount compared with what similar other facilities have cost over the years the sydney community is growing immensely with infill housing and it's known that and recently reported that one in 13 people in do to strengthen our resilience in our community the better our community will be for the future already this site has been developed and there's car parking associated with it and the subdivision has taken place and the the trust is expected to have some funds on hand but we consider that this is a very appropriate project to justify council support and so we ask that you consider favorably providing the funding that we've requested spread over two years which will be the 2022 and 23 years so thank you for the opportunity thank you very much for um coming and updating us on that today uh we've run out of time for questions but um that we will request some staff advice on all the issues that you've raised and make sure it comes back to us as well so that we can be fully informed and up to date on that process can it terrify how much they want against it got a bit convoluted with the loan how much are you needing we were sitting five hundred thousand dollars and it would make it a loan we've even suggested in the proposal that you have before you with the papers that um we're happy to transfer the property to the council and take a lease back on it the same as what happened when in 1979 when the old stone house was developed I was actually involved in that project at the time thank you very much what we'll do is we'll request staff advice back on all of those issues and the processes and the stage of the application at the moment all right thanks pauline thank you very much for coming along thank you just a quick question sam or john um are you able to get that advice through I don't know is there an application actually in the processes here yeah we uh uh we we have done some work with the uh the trust and we probably will be in a position to uh get advice across we'll have a closer look and uh I'll get back to you yeah so that'll be great thank you very much okay
Yes right so it was moved sam seconded andrew all those in favour any against all right carrie thank you very much uh any declarations of interest for today all right uh confirmation of previous minutes you're not happy to move those pauline second to tim all those in favor any against I don't clear that carried thank you very much and now we
Um look I'll just kind of because of the good progress this morning I'm just going to whip over to uh item 29 which is the mayor's monthly report um I'll take it as read and would someone like to move it uh jake and uh pauline um is there any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much um
So I'd like to I'd like to move the resolution to exclude the pub the public set out on the various pages to the agenda and supplementary agenda uh do I have a seconder for that uh jimmy chen I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried you
Say no it's carrie thank you very much thank you I've got the multicultural committee minutes um particular we should discuss thoroughly and in response to the royal commission their inquiry also the investigation report and the accommodation so first one the staff already to organize on the 8th of march you know we have a kind of zone meeting with the two ministers in royal communist commissioner representative next uh the stage we will host a meeting and engage with the multicultural advice group as well as some other relevant organizations to consider and have further discuss more detail then we will feedback to the council that's a main main point thank you very much are there any questions uh discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed and no it's carried thank you very much jimmy um and now
Presentation review initial proposal and if I could have staff at the end of the table thanks john and I have the foreshadowed motion from james gough and I have a an amendment from mike davidson so I feel that just for the interests of getting all the issues on the table we should just acknowledge what they are so that uh councillors can ask questions about any of them and can debate questions about any of them so essentially mike's amendment and that has been seconded that that's been moved and seconded so the amendment is have you got the amendment there mike's speaker sorry say that again joe um it's not moved or seconded until we're actually in debate okay so we'll we'll get sorry and I had the foreshadowed motion as well so um the amendment is to um not approve the recommended initial proposal and request staff develop a new initial proposal that the city is divided into six wards as per the currently proposed community board areas with the population of each ward electing three members apart it's saying that the councillors would be elected at large as opposed to um in the individual um yeah within the community board areas yeah the mayor remains selected at large so that's the um that's the uh amendment which we will uh vote on uh first and then the um um well actually is it an amendment or is it a foreshadow motion now the way it's written oh well I'll take some advice on that it may be another foreshadow motion and the other one is to the original wording was an amendment I don't know put your mic on put in just put your mic on hey this was an attachment to the report and this second if this is a new if this is an amendment you probably need to say the new attachment one that's better right but can't say does not approve the recommendation it depends if it was going to be and unfortunately you're amending an existing resolution yeah can can somebody play around with the wording essentially it was the way I had an amendment and I indicated that it would be accepted as an amendment um on advice the second one is um the foreshadowed motion which is the uh agreement and principle to um that to set the number of um elected members as one mayor eight councillors and twenty community board members requesting staff to make necessary arrangements to consult on attachment one noting that indicative boundaries have been identified by the dark green lines on attachment one the mayor remains elected at large the proposal consists of four awards each of the four awards is established as a community board two councillors and five community board members will be elected by the electors of each ward um the two councillors elected per ward are appointed as members of the respective community board there will be no central ward there is no specific bank spencer can we expel that correctly that would be really nice um or identification is an isolated community and each water is within a 10 plus or minus population variance and that's that's been established for the draft that's been attached has it so so mics will be converted to an amendment which will be put first a foreshadowed motion is put after the substantive motion only if it's lost if it fails right if it's lost yeah so um so but that they're essentially the two um alternatives to the two other elements that uh we're being asked to consider today but the primary approach is to consider the um the amendment uh the davidson amendment we'll call it followed by the um substantive uh resolution um whatever that is whether that's accepted or not and then um if if this if the substantive motion is lost then the foreshadowed motion comes to the comes to the fore all right so I'll open it up for um for a presentation perhaps if if if staff could just run through the legal process sometimes it's actually quite useful to remind people that we're in a process um and if you could describe uh where we are and the legal you know the steps that we're taking in order to comply with our obligations you leanne we are uh here asking council to resolve to accept an initial proposal should council accept this uh the proposal will be consulted on for eight weeks full community consultation at a city-wide level and a board level after that there will be a submissions hearings process all of council will be on the hearings panel two days have been convened for this because we do anticipate a lot of community feedback following this a final proposal will be drawn up and presented to council for adoption the uh there is a right for the community to uh appeal uh against the uh anything in the final proposal it is likely that the final proposal will cover the fact that banks peninsula is a separate ward are with considerably less population 62 percent less than the average so the proposal will have to be considered by the local government commission who will uh come up with a uh a final determination so we are at the very beginning of the process are seeking approval for an initial proposal and there is a a substantial journey ahead of us got to this point the we had an initial conversation with council around about july last year we engaged council over two related but not intimately connected matters firstly the electoral system and secondly the question of whether to uh create a maori ward the that happened over august and september last year kicking off on the 3rd of november we undertook a total of 15 workshops with councillors and community boards councillors were invited to all of the community board workshops those workshops iteratively worked up the initial proposal that is being presented to you at each stage of the process different elements of that proposal were discussed and we got sign off to proceed we were asked to deliver and did deliver on the 23rd of february a final wrap-up workshop for councillors summarizing and presenting all of the elements of the initial proposal and seeking a level of comfort to develop the proposal draft the council report and take it to this meeting on the 11th of march and this is where we are good well look just to get things on the table I'm going recommendations in front of us in the paper and andrew's going to second that so we'll now open it up for questions and as I said we can ask questions about the foreshadowed motion as well as the amendment as well so james aaron my question is just one around statutory time frames I'm just a bit unclear so can you help me is there a statutory deadline around when the public notices and also is there any statutory deadline or basically when does the final proposal have to be done so is there time to to make changes if there was a will to do so um the public notice has to be given 14 days after the council decision and the statutory time frame I think is the 9th of september that the council must have have to have given that's public notice I might be wrong there it might be the eighth of six okay so it's actually a long time though it is a long time the local government commissioners certainly encouraged councils okay two I had thought that I'd my mind but I wasn't sure if that was crete so thanks for clarifying thank you aaron so um depending on how the vote goes today john is it possible rather than going out to consult on one option which is just do you want to just keep it the way it is and this is what we're working with can we go out with the two options because one's quite radically different and if not why not no the statute provides for the council to resolve an uh initial option it has to be an option it's one so we cannot go out with two options this came up as a question through the office of the ceo and at a couple of briefings and we've been reasonably consistent with that advice so so then the some members of the public that might be slightly more cynical would say why bother going out they'd probably have to talk with the government on the legislation we're following the the statutory process we we do not have a uh any leeway in this those for the government probably yes that's council current yeah but the the count that comes back to the council after the well it comes back as a that we we meet as a hearings panel yes and form a recommendation from there and the last time we did this we made quite a substantial change as I recall involved akaroa bunks banks peninsula debate um as a significant focus jake um thank you thanks for the hard work you've put in over many months um from your early pre-engagement that you did in the survey that you had 900 and something responses to what was the preference split for single member awards first multi-member awards we'll looking up the details there was a strong preference for single member wards thank you I'll just follow on from that then um so I was approached by several people who had participated in the survey and were concerned that we would be looking to increase the number of councillors and their impression was the wording multi-member awards was designed to put more members in each ward that already existed in that wording we've only received that feedback from our one one one party and that's through south council at templeton they uh I'd surveys can always be a bit ambiguous but we would certainly take that on board as feedback it certainly wasn't feedback that was uh communicated by anyone else because you wouldn't know if you didn't know no is the whole point but it was ambiguous thanks I've got andrew and jimmy and mike um referring to paragraph three in the report the council must provide for effective representation of communities of interest there is a possibility today that the foreshadowed motion might be the thing that carries that we end up asking you to prepare a report to um bring back for approval um would you expect to be able to provide advice that the content of the foreshadowed motion provides for effective representation of communities of interest given that one of the proposed wards goes all the way from the akara heads to cathedral square I i counselor turner the uh our advice would be that uh council this work so it's uh very difficult to contemplate providing accurate advice I mean people are going to ask questions that are really just um surrounding the issue so we'll steer clear of that and and focus our attention we'll save that for debate as would be said in a parliamentary environment so um I've got ann about mike's amendment is it now yes just wondering if if so what he's suggesting here is that the community board areas now become wards is that I'm correct and so there is a potential is there a potential for within this system that there could be three elected members from well in our situation hornby that represent hallsville rickerton and hornby so three of the elected members could come from the same suburb is that correct yes yes it is okay thank you I just want to clarify so what you're saying is that if we um rejected uh the the recommendation uh that we've moved and moved to the uh foreshadowed motion that you would be in a position to report back a with a um an initial proposal that was capable of going out for consultation so you are we talking about the um council of davidson's amendment or we're talking about the foreshadowing the foreshadow motion and but well in both instances both of them would require you to go back and do work and report back and I can see that the foreshadowed motion is considerably more work but you are capable of delivering that if required delivering advice excuse offering advice delivering advice to us disagree is just yep we would have to go away and we would have to consider whether we had sufficient information to develop a proposal if we didn't we would have to have more workshops possibly more pre-engagement to get that information so it may take longer capable of putting that advice together for us even though that one will take longer but within the statutory time frames yes yes yes good um I just wanted to clarify that jimmy okay first one uh regarding to on page 188 those criteria plus a minus a hundred ten percentage I'm a 10 10 percentage plus already but this one will be you know still in uh process until uh if even you know that we are a proof you know alex now that uh consultation or next year take effect in october but still go on for the uh at least possibly six years well review again possibly just example in that written new subdivision of this kind of already passed over the 10 percentage even 15 percent is still possible how to mitigate those effects yeah the uh council chen firstly the uh we've done our best in our modeling to understand the growth areas of the city the areas that are likely to uh increase the uh uh secondly we have at a local representatives request added an area to ricketton so it is uh so it is full no it's uh not uh we're not capable of looking through a crystal ball they uh but were were reasonably comfortable with where we are bearing in mind that this will go out for public consultation if you'd just like to pause one second are that might be relevant to that answer that we've provided are at june 2020 so they are the uh the newest and the most current information available okay thank you second question I'd like to follow jake the question you replied to jack earlier I just want to know you engage with those uh before you mention a 1600 community or kid a residence but regarded enough you know counselor you know in that the the area or it's a single count or a single word for one counselor what's their view your informal consultation just saying that that uh as the same answer or similar answer we answered before there was a very small number that that uh suggested large awards so you estimated when where it's it was three percent through the survey so 48 said that they wanted the status quo um eight percent said at large across the whole city 41 said by a mix of both wards and at large and then three percent said multi-member awards so majority is a single one your council okay thank you three yeah you anne no okay you're back up you're back in the round okay mike sarah and anne sorry just my question relates to that it's just to correct something you just said john the majority of people did not actually our respondents did not actually support status quo of a single council award so we're just just confirming that they do yeah and and also it is very unclear about the multi-member awards um and that question was actually added in a bit later as as well it was so the three that were in there are the three that are in the legislation around how we can elect members so we kept it very clear that those are the three options we didn't have it in there because it wasn't something there well that's fine and in hindsight we could have made that clearer that it was yeah if we'd headed out there initially thank you sarah thank you just popping back to something that um ann checked on before um under the current system with single counts awards are councillors that they're currently elected to and do we have councillors around the table who are elected from outside that's a public record because you have to state it on your thing yes yeah yeah but we do we have councils that's not currently you can look it up yourself is your provision for rhetorical questions I mean this is getting a wee bit I don't know well that was one question at the time and I don't need assistance thank you so the other um so the the guidance that the local government commission gives for the representation review um for this year for 2021 um which I just came across the other day and we hadn't kind of gone through as a council um one of the things it looks at for when we're looking at boundaries for um boards subdivisions those kind of things is that supports communities of interest all of those kind of things which we've had a lot of amazing information on it's been really really good seeing those heat maps has been incredibly useful really addresses is um the encouragement of participation such as voting or standing as a candidate and I'm just wondering in what way the potential for these things to be used to encourage participation such as standing as a candidate has been taken into account or being raised with us during the process no the uh on the uh the third of november the uh the project team I spoke with council and uh outlined a proposal for how this process would run the uh uh we got the feedback on how it would run and uh we decided uh the feedback we got was not to do a uh super comprehensive process going back to basics the uh we agreed with what we were going to do and we followed the uh are spending a lot of time considering the matters that you've raised council templeton uh uh wasn't raised and we haven't uh spent a lot of time investigating that or reporting back yeah it's just that um while we gave our feedback on what the proposed process was we didn't have an for us to do from the local government commission I've just come across that I'm just I'm just saying so we haven't been able to take into account during this process um encouraging participation such as voting or standing as a candidate because that's not what we chose to do as a process but you you raise a point the only thing I could say that at all times we've uh asked for any questions or any suggestions items of interest to be sent through to the office of the chief executive again that hasn't been sent through as a concern or a factor I think that it's it's just it's a set of guidelines accepted the council has just said that she wasn't aware of them at the time she's become aware of them and she's perfectly entitled to raise them by way of a question and your answer is is that that element hasn't been taken into account because it will be relevant to one of the issues that we will debate today um then jake thank you so just clarifying that uh did you did you say I mean since the 3rd of november we've had 15 workshops yes for counsellors no they uh they've been five workshops that have been exclusively for councillors there have been uh 10 workshops for community board members the the including councillors except for one on the 12th of february that was limited to community board chairs and deputy chairs so that was uh the opportunity for councillors to ask questions to clarify things about the information that was that was given that that's what the point of the councillors and community board members in different forums and different settings some centrally some city-wide uh some in here and some locally are just with the uh the community board themselves so it would be so what we're being presented with today in terms of your recommendations as a result of those workshops and the feedback that you got from councillors yes those as I said in the probably the the last uh that the last summing up workshop on the 23rd there's call it that we really weren't unable able at this stage to uh accommodate and council's direction was let's have a look at that with all the other potential changes through the hearings process thank you um a couple more that I've just thought of is it possible that if you were to go away and work on either the amendment or the foreshadowed motion that when you come back that the advice might very well say this is undesirable we don't think this will fly with the local government commission you know perhaps for example grouping too many different communities into one big ward the they I understand the the amendment and the uh foreshadowed motion requires us to come back with a initial proposal and that's what we do and the rationale behind it right um and my other question is in terms of the the survey you sent out and the results you got back was there any hint of pro forma or like-for-like type answers in there nope so that sample was randomly selected off our research panel and it it was very randomly selected and there was no option for people to ford it on and have other people complete it so it was managed pretty tightly perfectly perfect thank you sam just a quick one on so two e the resolution which says use of gifted tadeo uh maori names so community boards recognize the gifts the relationships and formalises the use of the names just so I'm really clear that'll still be like for our one waimea or depending on how the resolutions go to that waimea fendelte and waianae hereward yes yes so that it wouldn't just be waimea would have no yeah okay thank you uh yani so just to be clear when was the um initial proposals final boundaries presented to council for the first time today so the last two the last review that we had the workshop the uh the the final workshop was the 23rd of february they uh I would just need to check with my project team whether any of the boundaries presented at that workshop were different from any previous allow me to do that if I just won't be able to answer your previous yeah so deep yeah they are so that the boundaries in the report today were presented at the last two workshops uh yeah the final workshop was a summing up right that's as I understood it so why is the lynnwood one changed why have you changed the boundary to always road when that was never raised with me right because the feedback we've given previously and the one on the 9th of february showed really clearly the changes and now on this one you've got a completely different boundary allow us to double check that and we'll uh come back to you right um and then the other thing is um there's a number of the wilson um in the columns you've got wolfstein referred to three times in three different wards for the same area so you've got wolfson south wilson east yep boston west yep I think it's probably just a typing era or something but no no they uh possibly they're different communities of in sorry't necessarily align with what we would expect to see for our communities and because christchurch doesn't have many official suburb boundaries it's really difficult to define those areas so every single spatial data set that you come across is going to have it in a different place with a different name so those might not match up exactly with what you would expect to see but they are what we have to have in there and other steps instead you say two boundaries okay so here was the presentation we got on the 24th of february so why so that's as I understood the yellow I think john's said that he's just going to get some additional advice on that ashley's just gone upstairs to double check the maps no just here so that is good up some steps no no he's uh somebody that's gone up upstairs so could we move on and come back to that answer okay all right good thank you um were there any other questions it appears to be the interquestions so um I mean I'm a little bit unclear as to what that means in terms of um proceeding to the debate you've changed like a massive part of the linwood ward that everything up until now has given the impression that it was completely different we've we haven't made any changes you've put the boundary down baldwin's road when it was in the diagrams it looked like it was going in here so you've taken phillipstown and charleston out of linwood the officers sure that the change hasn't been made since the last workshop yeah so there was a whole bunch of changes made between it would be working I was told that that feedback had been pretty substantial to take phillips down out of the linwood and charleston as well and charleston that has not been made since the last workshop on the 23rd but it was made private I raised the feedback because initially you took phillipstown and put it into central and feedback was given that that should stay the sun and then we had to ensure that the preston's ward so that change had to be made to accommodate keeping preston's within burwood in a single ward so yeah it's only two places but that was made before the 23rd yeah what what unequivocally saying is the the ward maps presented at the uh at the summary that was asked for on the 23rd are the maps in the uh in the initial proposal uh we're just getting the absolute iterations of the map so we can prove that no I get that so what I thought was that the boundary with the black line was the ward right so the black lines the ward and this was the feedback that you'd had and you changed it look at that not the other way I'm not gonna have any more of this so ann you've got a question clarify that through the submission process isn't that the sort of feedback that we expect and that's what why we have the submission process so then we have the hearings and then if there's enough support for that then that's what happens excuse me yani yani um it is clear that um that the this uh this particular change uh was misinterpreted by councillor johansen and um and as a result this has been a surprise to him but he's had these papers for as long as everyone else has had them um and this is the first that I was aware that this was a concern so it does make it very difficult when people don't notify in advance that issues of substance are being raised at the end of the day this is an issue that can be dealt with in the hearings process and I'm sure that both um that the community board and members of the phillipstown community and charleston community will be very alert to this and will be very clear about where they believe their communities of interest lie so I'm not going to predetermine it here it's it's a matter that went through a particular process but we are at the beginning of the legal process now and that means that we are not putting out a a proposal putting out an initial proposal we will be calling for submissions as I said before the last time we went out to with with an initial proposal in 2015 when we went out with an initial proposal and that year the final proposal um was very different from the one that went out so um and that's that's actually a good thing to to know that substantial changes can be made so yanI's concerns can be addressed his communities may not feel the same way and we have to allow the process um to proceed so that's the end of the questions we have the questions from two members that come in we've got um I'm I'll well I don't know I'll just catch you up so essentially we've got an amendment on the table uh which will um allow for a debate around um electing uh at large across the wider community board area and that's um that's uh that's councillor um davidson and then we've got a um a foreshadowed motion if the substantive reduction in the four-way yeah and the advice that we've had is that the only difference is that that amendment would take a lot longer to come back to council for signing off but we have got till the 9th of september or whatever the date is in order to put up the initial proposal but we don't really want to push it out that far because this will excite a large number of submissions positive about that now which is a good thing and and as a result um we need time to make a final decision and then to allow for the objections process to take it through to the local government commission if necessary okay well thanks for that update I was gonna that was gonna be my question where are we at yeah but and apologies for absence but we've been current awards and um got really good news for you later excellent I was hoping you'd come back with good news good um so uh so so um so we've got a motion on the table and uh we and'll formally move the amendment and who's seconding that amendment sarah templeton um and we have a foreshadowed motion and we can have the foreshadowed motion councillor golf seconded sam mcdonald right good okay let the debate begin and just be clear we're just having one debate and we can talk on the amendment for sure nice and substantive cool easy sorry well I'll I'll kick off the debate since I've um moved it pro forma uh first of all I'd like to acknowledge uh staff having gone through what is a very significant process to get to this point and as I said before this is the start of the process which is where we go out and engage with the wider community whatever decision we make today um we're at the beginning of that process which is to formulate an initial proposal we're under relatively um strict requirements of the of the legislation in terms of effective and fair representation and fair representation is determined by a plus or minus percentage of 10 percent around the average size of the the past has been and the proposal is that we maintain that in the akara world bank's peninsula ward being a separate ward but all of the debate around the foreshadowed motion has actually guaranteed that this in itself will be a major uh source of submissions into the process uh as they return for the third time to battle for uh the retention of what was their old district boundaries there was an agreement reached so that christchurch city would basically subsume the bank's peninsula district council it was something that was voted for by the um by the by the banks peninsula residents but voted against by the christchurch city residents so christchurch didn't want to have banks peninsula it was they called it a shotgun wedding um but essentially it was they were the two the two were merged and undertakings were made at that time about the representation that would continue to exist we did have to fight for the representation last time in front of the local government commission as well but as I said the the recommendation changed all all of are subject and open for discussion and and genuine feedback we made substantial changes the last time this happened so I welcome the debate I think it's really important and I look forward to hearing how people want to approach this and hopefully a way that enables people to feel that they have something to contribute something to say and that they will be listened to and thank you so I will be supporting the recommendation the officers recommendations I think this is about fair and effective representation for individuals and communities and these recommendations will I believe will best ensure that fair and equitable representation the changes in the award boundaries reflect uh communities how communities affiliate and with neighbouring wards and form larger communities of interest and I look forward to to the involvement of our communities in this discussion through these submissions and being involved in the hearings panel in the discussions that come from that aaron um I'll raise a couple of points and then but I'll start by before I do saying that I'm actually going to listen to the debate up my mind um and I say that because for many elections now the voter turnout in christchurch hasn't been that great is the system we've got uh doing that well is it engaging enough people um so essentially we're a minority elected minority running the city not the majority more than 50 people didn't vote so uh do we we hadn't even have a mandate but we're here um it would be interesting to look at uh the system that james is proposing I personally wish we were going up with two proposals so the public had two different cats to look at and go you know what I want to put my money on that one or on that one but that's not the system we work in it's conversation with the government with all the other conversations with the government which brings me to my other point in the term that you sometimes hear when you suggest radical changes the drain the swamp um a great president once said that um not the one that's springing to mind politician to use the term uh and it refers to um washington dc because it's built on a swamp and you drain it get rid of all the mosquitoes and uh christchurch built on a swamp as well and so when people say drain the swamp in christchurch it's an interesting term to use because geographically we're very similar um I wish we were proposing both and today I will uh listen to the debate of everyone and see see where that gets us christians doesn't have oysters though so there's a geographical difference sarah um we have work to do on representation diversity and inclusion in ototahi christchurch in the lead up to march 15th anniversary we should be looking at taking clear steps to enable the wide range of people in our city to take up the opportunity to help shape the city in 2015 there was a strong desire to address this and in 2016 for all the right reasons we moved to single council awards however the impacts were not as expected we have had fewer candidates standing and fewer women diversity but we should in 2016 we had four councillors elected unopposed in new zealand's second largest city and in 2019 only seven of 46 candidates for council were women we need to do better single council awards favor the incumbent so I can see why my colleagues might be wary of change and more competition but I for one would rather have more people that more people were willing to stand and felt like they had a shot having more candidates also encourages more people to vote they have more choice and they see that they have more influence on how council is made up single council awards have also led to patch protection and a loss of wider perspective on the city they have clearly not met the local government commission guidance that our electoral system should encourage participation such as voting or standing as a candidate one thing that we could do to address the diversity inclusion and participation and patch protection would be to go back to having councils elected at large across community board areas though with community board members still elected in small the last change but changing the one thing that didn't voters would have the freedom to choose and hold to account three councillors not just the one that they do now and they would be more likely to have at least one councillor that shares their values and priorities and that three councillors could work together across the board area it would also encourage more people to stand with three seats up for grabs there is a lot there is less of a barrier and the statistics bear this out in the four elections prior to the 2016 we had an average of 3.9 candidates per seat and 48 women councillors around the table and since the 2016 change we have had an average of 2.6 candidates per seat and only 20 of female councillors single council awards are anti-democratic and we're not proposing to even try and help the local government commission is clear that multi-member wards provide greater choice for voters and following the election provide greater choice for residents on who to approach on local issues and allow sharing and specialising and responsibilities between councillors council davidson's amendment and I'd encourage people to submit if they want more choice and better engaged and more available representation when we began this process I think we were all totally aware of the amount of stuff that's going on in our city and in the country generally not notwithstanding an ltp year as well on top of our covered stuff as well so we decided and I think we all agreed that just a tweak at this point would be the best option but within that we decided to equalise the community boards so that they were all um three-ward boards we had to do that to equalise pay parity um and so as a result of that um it's become a little bit bigger than we first anticipated um I i won't be supporting the amendment I'll be supporting the original staff recommendation that we have today after 15 workshops where we thought we were all working well together and achieving a unified stance to put out this is all surprising to me at the last minute I'm very wary've experienced when I was in a double ward when at one stage I was the only one out of uh seven representing my area and the rest were all from the other ward and um and those were incumbents who were favored and repeatedly elected so um I don't support um being um elected at large at all I think it's a very dangerous situation and it does end up with some people not having any representation at all in their local area so I'd be very very careful of that one so I'm not going to say much more today except I urge you to be careful of the amendment and support the staff recommendation that we have worked so hard together on to go out for consultation and let's hear back from the people sam yeah thank you leanne um look I don't need to speak for too long on this other than to say that I'll be no surprise I'm obviously supporting um james goff's foreshadowed uh proposal um and I think you do it for a signal to the city that actually we're prepared to make change as well um in the end if we can be far more effective and far more efficient I think that can only be a good good thing for the city um certainly the thing that stood out to me as everyone would probably expect is these cost savings that come with it as well um you know three million a year conservatively uh without even looking at those additional flow honor costs and if you look through it you know reducing eight councillors saves us 920 000 a year reducing 17 community board members is another 340 000 a year and losing three community boards would save us another 1.7 and I can see people shaking their heads and go oh no they'll put the put the remuneration up we'll go and have a look at auckland you know if you have a look at that the per capita up there they represent 70 000 each so it's certainly not anything like that I think the key thing though is that if you have effective community boards as well so I'm really surprised that people aren't keen to see some drastic change I think it would send a real signal to the city uh allow the staff here to actually get on and do their job and not sit in meetings with us all day over thousands and thousands of questions and I think you know finally the challenge really would be that in the end if um you know I think we should really look for more competition it wouldn't hurt some of us uh to go back out to the real world and so I'd certainly hope that you would uh you know be pleased to progress the foreshadow motion anyone else andrew thank you um unsurprisingly I favor the initial programme in the report it keeps democracy as close to the community as possible it increases the opportunity for people to elect someone that they might actually know and that might actually genuinely know their community and it holds their elected member clearly accountable to the local people that elected them um our city's got many communities a diversity of representation that reflects those different communities and in my view the only way that we achieve that is by electing community board members and councillors by ward each ward having its own particular needs and issues and I would suggest we do that rather than any concept of electing at large whether that's over the whole sitting whether it's over a quarter of the sitting or whether it's by a large over an area three times the size of the current wards the size of the current the size of the ward influences the kind of people who stand for election running for election in a larger ward inevitably requires greater resources more time more money that in itself limits the number of people that are able to do so limits the ability of genuine grassroots community people to stand for election limits the opportunity for real community knowledge real community connection and also limits that diversity and representation that we're talking about any large model by design advantages those with greater name recognition and greater resources and disadvantages everybody else so the deliberately advantages the well-resourced and the well-known for the reasons that I've just described it therefore then concentrates power into a smaller and likely less diverse group of people and interestingly and this is particularly notable concentrates and distributes the existing remuneration pool of about 1.7 million dollars across that smaller group of councillors so has the effect of doubling the remuneration of that smaller number of people to over two hundred thousand dollars per annum half the councillors half the remuneration twice the pay I don't see the saving in that and I can't see how that could be better for christchurch how it could be better for representation or could be better for anybody other than than those well-resourced and well-known people who would benefit from this particular model it seems it started with a claim of a bloated council but on closer inspection it seems that the only bloating here would be the salaries and pockets of this smaller resulting number of councillors um I also don't know how the claimed um three million dollar saving the proposal has been arrived at if boards or losing a number of community boards as has been said um I don't think that really is in the spirit of um effective representation and it worries me that that might be a wider end of the narrow end of a wider wedge that might see community boards gone altogether at some point thank you uh james thanks I'll just really expect the foreshadowed motion um it's quite quite simple and that's what I think is the attractive um idea around it city split into four quadrants or wards with cathedral squares center point north west north east south west south east pretty easy to understand two councils elected in each ward five community board members in each ward the broad geographic lines take into account the 10 plus or minus population variance may as elected at large and the community boards are made up of seven in total with obviously two appointed councillors from those respective wards you know I'd like to see this proposal truly empower the community boards and I don't think that has happened uh actually ever since ltp on local projects and the capital program uh delegating it to the community board to prioritize uh within their own ward and if they deem it a priority they can bring things forward but equally they would then need to decide what goes back and I think that that would be you know a real step forward in empowering community boards and we could do that uh with a prize such as this so for me all of this is about striking the balance between good representation but equally good governance if you have many elected members it's very good for representation but it's not so good for efficiency or making good decisions if you have very few elected members it's great for efficiency keeping things focused and you get far better collective decision making but it's not so great for representation I feel that the I feel the balance thank you point I feel that this gets the balance right it enables a council of nine to bring city-wide strategic elements together in the best interests of christchurch as a whole in each community at a local level and make meaningful decisions in their own right each community board member would represent around 13 or so thousand people in their ward so by no means is that a number uh un unreasonably you know manageable or out of sync with other metropolitan centers I don't believe that would be harder for good people to get elected admittedly it makes it harder for people around this table to be elected because there's fewer seats higher competition but that's the point it's the entire point of this and I see this as a good thing good candidates will do just fine big election expenditure consistently doesn't translate into big votes but performance generally does and right off the bat the structure saves around three million per year and salaries and admin costs alone where are they where do you find that in in our own budget in the 2021 financial budget so remember as well as operational so five million equates to about one percent in rates so it's not an insignificant figure and as for the ream authority and numbers um look at history we added more councillors at the last rep review 13 to 16. did salaries go down then no no they they went up actually and you're actually breaching the act if you bring remuneration into this decision as the act clearly stipulates that you need to focus on the representation elements of it and not remuneration so even going there is clearly in breach of of the act and I'll touch on two final aspects of the proposal if I can that's all sorry is that all she wrote yeah that's all she wrote all right I'll go for it it's next time you can read about it however I did find out that um they they switched off my um they switched off my timer at uh at three minutes yes but the beginning of the debate it's five so I'm just going to take the other two minutes just to just to clarify a couple of things um just the one the one thing I did want to clarify is the question of remuneration so polls so the pool's disappeared the the remuneration pool which says that x number of councillors you divide the pool by the number of councillors there's one exception here and that is the deputy mayor is paid uh um an additional part of the remuneration pool in order to to cater for the fact that they are the um the person that stands in when the mayor isn't available so uh there is a um that that's the requirements under the and under the legislation so the truth is is that um essentially if you have the number of councillors they will get double the pay so let's be honest about that and just put it out there could we be honest about or legal advice whether or not we're actually allowed to bring remuneration I'm calling a point of voting myself actually sarah if you're allowed to bring remuneration into our decision making on the representation review you brought it in and it started and so we were clarifying I speak to the people well I want some clarity then on making we're getting of anything that should influence the decision in fact you're not allowed to be influenced by that measure but for someone that excellent advice have you got advice that says it will double sorry for someone that acts on advice have you got we're not here to debate this um a point of order has been raised is the point of order that um you've been misrepresented or what you've said no james goff has raised a point of order on my comments which relate to the effect of the um remuneration pull and I'm not saying that we should take the remuneration impact into account but I thought that it was important that the remuneration impact were clarified and I i want clarity on if I may on whether impact of remuneration is allowed to be factored by members as they make a decision on the representation review no but I'm not I'm not suggesting do you mind if we can actually get the advice and then you can take it from there talking about remuneration isn't want to refer to remuneration as part of your discussion on numbers number of councillors number of representatives if you want to refer to remuneration I don't see anything that says you can't no could I just clarify I i do I'm not trying to contradict the legal advice but the legal advice is correct there's nothing to stop you discussing it but it is not a factor that is in consideration for the rationale for the proposal and so that's why you will not see it featured in the proposal that the team have put up and it's so it's not one of the rationales you would make and plus in the argument that discussed reducing the council being what the point which is not true when I was speaking was simply this that a reference was made to the reality that remuneration packages weren't altered by the remuneration authority when the number of councillors increased at the last remuneration review that wasn't there wasn't a pool operating in that year there is a pool operating again now and and the exception is any higher rate that's paid to an individual member of the council and in this case it is just the deputy mayor who is in that category so I was just simply clarifying what the what the situation was there's no such thing as a point of clarification clarifying that we're not allowed to take into account the um the the potential savings when we're looking at representation no you're not allowed to take remuneration into account so I'm sorry the savings of human regeneration go to the individual counsellors in that regard we would be conflicted all of us so we aren't allowed to take it into account in our decision making that was the advice that we've received it's the advice that we've operated on and I was simply responding to a um comment comment that was made that that could have been misinterpreted and I felt that it really deserved to be clarified I should have just finished my debate now yes please the last thing that I wanted to um say in the amendment and the reason I'm going to support the amendment is that I wanted uh very much for um the issues that pauline cotter raised actually to be addressed and and I was a supporter of changing it to the individual wards I've changed my mind because the implications for encouraging people to stand was not an intended consequence it's an unintended consequence and I think sometimes when unintended consequences occur there is always an opportunity to review them I'd rather that our initial proposal went out with the idea that we are changing from individual wards to across the community board area I rather we went out with that and invite people to submit on that basis rather than the other way around thank you melanie today has been um I haven't really written anything down because I'm surprised by today we have gone through all these workshops we've gone through community boards and we have got to this place where we're at to something that's similar to what we have today and we're um there's a and central health get bored and now we're talking about completely different things that I had no expectation of a week ago let alone maybe even the beginning of this week and now we're talking about something completely different and the community boards have had no input and if we put through either the amendment or the foreshadow motion there's been no community board and put into it we're just expecting them to come back during the submission process and I just I'm not understand that one bit and back to what I was going to talk about to start with is that it is important that we have small awards in my opinion because it means that each counselor is responsible for the area they should be accessible and people should be able to go to them and they should know about their local issues and if we don't do a good job well we get not elected the next time and that's how it is if you've got it's very like everyone said before if you have an elected get two people from cashmere it's what we used to have and the whole you know areas are just left unrepresented as particularly the lower socioeconomic areas and it's really important that we represent those and that we are a diverse group of people you can't get that when you're voting for at large and but community board areas it just is not possible and if you're a new candidate if you wanted to run individually you could not do that on on a community board wide basis because it's just prohibitive to anybody new coming in it's disgusting to even think about it in my opinion tim yeah thank you I'm actually really disappointed by today I really am by my colleagues we've worked really hard listen to a lot of information I was elected unknown politically because I was known in my community that is why I got elected into a community board I was also elected unopposed because I worked bloody hard like a lot of other people around this table and now we're sitting there going think it's really important I think you've got to stand up and be counted in front of those meetings that are really hard I'm the only councillor I believe that went and visited most of those families that were affected than flooding that had their homes either taken because of the flooding and we had doctors certificates etc and were in tears I went with staff that's because I am a ward counsellor and I believe that is why I got re-elected because I do the hard yards I I've been listening to this table and I think some of you have actually forgotten about what we're really doing this for anyone in this country can stand for elected office I leave school illiterate look where I am so you know I listen to all of this and you know the real world I know the real world really well and that's why I can represent all aspects of my community and I'm really proud to and I will be supporting stinkers jimmy this is another kind of the game theory a setback the advantage in large one looks like the elector have a greater choice like uh manually mentioned earlier great choice flexibility in elections also western have a large number of counselors to approach with their consent but the the setback is because while the campaign is a big area probably you need to spend much time you know more cost but to the rich people not too difficult but to poor people maybe it's difficult to spend much time even we have a kind of serious hope this one but the other one is the kind of the tech into account who is you're the kind of local uh counselor but in that one we have three council all local council bahu is truly you know to be engaged accountable he said still need to consider this morning you can see my pic picture there I'm the towns of homby if we have three who own behalf council of hong ki this will also need need to consider this this I think about it even now our local mp in a big area but each mp essential so this is my concern consider the campaign you know particular small areas still can give the people not easier you know it's high quality one can can can make make it happen but I'm not disappointed it's still regarding the boundary of the uh coming for each country because even we have a 15 times particular emphasis oh we changed this when we consider they were never feeling but who knows this I still don't know that's not a fully truly open transparent this is my predicament I just not not not not not agree with the draft the boundary but regarding small and bigger one probably compare advantages I still prefer smaller anyone else might oh sorry james thank you um oh mike sorry and you've got five minutes I think is that right yep oh okay last time yeah okay not a problem well I guess firstly I want to respond to some of the comments from counselors appear a little bit angry about how this debate is shaped up look I've raised numerous times throughout a fairer representation and also like to acknowledge caster goff who's also done that at times as as well I also signaled at the last workshop that I would be raising an amendment so it's actually disappointing to hear some of those comments directed at us today um my amendment actually what it does it only affects councillors and if this process through the consultation process and was adopted we would all still be ward councillors with the initial appraisal proposal I still support status quo the community board members being elected at a geographically smaller local level at the grassroots and I support the initial proposal of having all the community boards being of similar size and and make up and I support the proposal of banks financial retaining being an isolated community I'd also like to acknowledge all the work that has been done I believe my amendment although will need a little bit of tweaking is only minor tweaking um it won't actually affect the ward boundaries I do personally have some concerns um about the impact on redwood but I'm actually happy about it themselves but for a number of reasons I believe that councillors should be elected across the community board area so one thing to make clear is this amendment it does not change the total number of councillors it doesn't change a population per member and the work already done on boundaries it does however actually allow for a few important factors that will I believe create better and fair representation and encourage people to participate in the election this amendment provides greater choice for voters after the election if resident residents will have more choice on who to approach for local issues meaning is more likely for at least one of the local elected councillors share the views and values of local residents and this will actually help improve public engagement it'll allow local councils to share and work together on local issues while at the same time being stored accountable to the people who have elected them it will spread skill sets of different councillors over a large number of residents it will encourage people to stand a number of good people decide not to when there's only one position this in turn may lead to more diversity around the table by through thought and people diversity the data across a number of elections show that the average money spent on an election campaign between small and large wards is minimal and often candidates who spend the most do not get elected and for those who believe fewer counsellor is the way to go then this would be a lot easier to get that outcome through the consultation process than actually if we elected to consult on status quo and finally I think importantly the majority of people survey did not support retaining status quo of single council awards thank you okay uh james kiara look I'm glad I wasn't here for the questions because councillor major and I were being productive in our joint wards but here we are with this on on our table and I'm surprised and disappointed and I accept what counselor davidson just said about raising it at previous workshops but it's hard to remember what happened because we've had so many workshops on've been out to count our staff have been out to community boards as uh councillor coca has mentioned and so I think that we have traversed the various options on this representation review so as I say I was surprised and disappointed that we have the amendments and the foreshadowed motion so that's ironic and rich coming from someone who speaking of money spent on campaigns who spent just a little less in council major and so being well resourced and having good name recognition is one of the reasons that I'm here and it worries me that that's how it could end up and you should be worried that I'm here as well but but I take the you know I ca I know I have jokes and laughs and things but you know I do take the role really seriously it's a it's a privilege it's a responsibility and I think that we've thrashed this out and the staffs I don't agree with the staff's recommendations but I support them thank you jani yeah um just as known as hagley ferrymade and looked at the voter turnout statistics what was really interesting to me was that the ferrymade side had a voter turnout of about 65 and the hagley side which is the kind of inner city east linwood uh central city area had a 35 voter turnout if you don't think that's gonna make a difference in an election um you know if you go to at large then I i just can't comprehend that the reality is that when that happened to the city when we went from smaller local wards to bigger wards that took in multiple wards and had multiple candidates uh elected across them so we went from 24 to 12 and they were still across those big awards you saw quite clearly that the wealthier areas tended to get better representation so I just think the point that um counselor coker made should not be lost on anyone so I do support the idea of local representation but I mean I guess I'm in the view similar agreement with councillor daniels there's been a lot of in it it's a proposal that's getting put out and let's get it out and let's hear what the people have to say I think at this late stage to come up with a new proposal um is not really the right thing to do otherwise I'd start moving amendments on all sorts of things um but I'm not going to um I just wanted to make two other comments which is I'm really sad that the proposal has been to get rid of the linwood central heathcote community board I don't feel that we've really thought about the options uh through the process and so obviously we'll wait and see what the feedback is on that but that is a thing that I just I don't see the need to get rid of that community board in its entirety I understand that there may be needed some changes around which wards consist make up that community board and the other thing is there are some quite significant changes that I'm disappointed have not been brought to our I represent but again I'm happy to hear what the community have to say and and go through that process rather than make the amendments today look thank you very much um I'm actually thrilled with the way the debate's gone uh that was a high quality debate uh it was and that was because people actually talk passionately about what it's all about and what what what drives them what motivates them and and yes what gets them re-elected which is that very direct upfront and personal uh connection to their to their um their residence uh and the the way that uh people conducted that debate I thought was um was exemplary uh so I'm actually going to thank councillor davidson and council of golf for putting other items on the agenda I don't think that the amendment will pass but um I am going to vote for it simply because I do believe that it would be a very good way of drawing people into the process the substituted amendment I mean the um foreshadowed motion that that particular one has they have done before but my final point is this and it's really to pick up on yanI's point that things will change in the process that we now enter into and the reason that it will change and I want to use the example of akaroa in 2015 we proposed a sumner banks peninsula ward that's why there were so many um representations from them that's why we made the changes uh to the awards that we had gone out and proposed and that's why the final proposal was able to um you know withstand uh the uh the challenge that was made in front of the local government commission so we're on our journey and hopefully I will now put the put the motion and I'm going to put the amendment first so so those in favor please say I i those opposed say no that is lost well and truly didn't sound like it was but now we move to the substantive motion um and I'll put that motion you just be clear um sorry lynn just that vote against yes the substantive correct correction just for anyone yeah just repeat so for you he has a foreshadowed motion so the motion is to go out with the with the initial proposal that we've workshopped that so that's that's the vote on the table and what james is saying is that if people would prefer to vote for the um foreshadowed motion then they would vote no to this one no no no all right so we're all clear I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no just record it so hands up for no so mike james um catherine oh hang on it was your debate and actually I'm just against one c yeah just one secret yeah yeah I don't so maybe mike and yani I think have got specific ones that they might then yeah I wanted one recorded against the community board yeah that's right so there's a community board resolution as well could I ask that we just take a division on that then I want to't want to cancel davidson against one c against the resolutions regarding the community board rj I declare that carried
Every multi-use arena elected members update so um first and foremost for those that don't know I'd like to introduce chris thomas he's the cmua pd limited project director for delivery of this so welcome chris I'm not asking him to speak to this just put names to faces so that you can uh you can see but if there's anything you want to ask them please do um do you want to take the update as red or we just want to give you a quick update on our current status at the moment I think we can take the update as red it's just if there's anything to add that's happened since the update was prepared we can talk to uh we've just completed obviously um the rfp closed on in on 29th of january we've just spent probably the most intensive reading of document period for about three weeks and we've gone through some fantastic presentations from three great uh opportunities um it's been a highlight a highlight of my career today to to to to see the level of um capability that's wants to come here and do this particular and carry out this particular project um we obviously can't talk much more about it really we're in the process of a due process that we have to go through in order to appoint so we will be bringing that back to council on the 25th of march so which will be an agreement to proceed with the pre-contract services agreement so that's the status of the project today with regards to on-site works um enabling works are completed to a degree they're now within the site boundary um the cone cones or the permanent bollards that are in place on litchfield and casual street are part and parcel of the permanency and the road stopping exercise that we're going through which is being is underway and the signage that supports that and the warnings to people and the signing of that um I did speak to councillor johansson just before and I've had an update from our project manager regarding ongoing discussions with our transport team and improving that sequence sequencing so that the traffic flow can be enhanced so that's ongoing uh the only other thing we haven't spoken about is uh signage and and further signage to assist the public and I'll I'll investigate that over the next day or so so that's the latest update on the actual project itself excellent thank you thanks very much are there any questions just the one off the transport one which was um surely the lights that casual um barbados can actually be removed now because it's just a t intersection yeah so that's underway it's more around the flow on barbados and madras which is being impacted by the sequences of the lights so um the team are currently talking to transport about how they improve that so I think we're it's a can you can you actually switch those lights off in the meantime before they're removed that's exactly what they're talking about right now okay because I mean there's just been a little bit of chitter chatter around it right arrows out of all the other lights thank you we'll address it thank you um yani you've got a question I just um I mean I know we've kind of considered that but it does seem quite sad that the ng building is is having to be removed is there any opportunity what's the opportunity within the design to incorporate that is there any um I mean it's just being in the media again recently so is there any solution that could be found possibly to retain that heritage building I i think I have to refer you back to lens and lin's acquiring that as part and parcel of the original um recovery plan and that's where we're at with that with with that particular property at the moment so I mean I guess I just read like you know the 10-year reflection of the quake and there's some been some pretty interesting and reflective pieces on the loss of heritage the manchester majestic theater for example is is there any way that if that property is acquired that that we don't lose the opportunity to incorporate it if it's possible it's I suppose the the intent of the precinct as a whole is not just the pre the precinct as a whole is clear by that one property um and the uh to maximize the benefits to the community we've got to give that opportunity to the design team and the period that we're entering entering into at the moment is that design consortium phase which is about maximizing the opportunities for the whole of the city and how we place the eventual arena on the site and locate it is yet to be defined uh totally we've only ever been under the we've only ever had a proof of concept which we've had which was about um ensuring the quality of the investment case that we put to the crown and council so yeah that building is sits with lens at the moment I can't really comment sorry all I was trying to understand is if it's acquired does it have to be demolished straight away or the design mr chairman that that's for lindster as mary says we probably have this discussion when we come back yeah I think it would be you know I mean yeah I don't know if others read the pieces that were written about the lost heritage in the city but it was I just thought it was quite important but it's also about it's also about the future but let's yeah let's pick it up at the appropriate time yeah all right thank you any further questions on this particular report all right so I'm happy to move receipt of the report 10 mule second any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried aleister thank you very much indeed thank you right now we move to item 14 the closeout report on stapleton's road
We've finished the agenda no we haven't okay the draft development contributions who's sitting here waiting gavin will be here gavin will be here in a moment so um the draft development contributions policy we haven't got a presentation though have we so we have been briefed and everything if it would help I would move it out for consultation I'm happy to move mike zappy to second it's been pretty thoroughly yeah no but we we had we've done a lot of again we've done a lot of work so I'd like to
Much jimmy and now on to the regulatory performance committee minutes um tim skandra thank you I'll take the report as read just a couple of highlights with regards to the concern with many communities with the infilling the the unit's still reaching 92 satisfaction so I think that's quite outstanding um there's a lot of pressure on them at the moment um the unconsidered car park um parking issue that's gone out 90 litres went out to land owners etc so that's underway and they've been contacted one of the hangovers I guess from covert 19 and being isolated and being back at home is noise complaints did increase about 40 and that will just take a bit of time to get back to normal whatever the normal is for noise complaints so that's being managed we did receive um some spot um correspondence one from the pepin illness community board with regards to the rma process review we have a specialist barrister taking undertaking that that is underway but I stress it's about process and the process that has memory there are about 25 decisions that he is reviewing so um that's underway which is great to see we also received a petition from auburn's residents with regards to their concerns over some of the infilling plans and from those um the committee did ask council staff to um work directly with one's family that had a um severely handicapped family member so we've asked council staff to work directly with them because the community had concerns about them getting access in and out for their fam um have their family member so um I'm happy to move this if any questions etc I've noticed staff aren't here but you know I'll do my best um do I have a secondary um aaron cuen any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry thank you very much tim uh
Well I'm not being working on the um the resolution so the these um standard resolutions adopting the tree policy requesting staff to update the council public facing website I'm happy for three to remain the way it was and in fact it's um it should just have the words two community boards added to the end of it and um and then we've changed the wording for uh the the remainder and then the final two ones are as per the one in front of us so essentially the adoption of the tree policy uh the essence of it and the others are um they're not required as part of the adoption of the tree policy but they're all issues that were considered by the by the hearings panel and we've looked at a way to make them a meaningful uh program of work so that staff can actually implement them so um and report back is required so I don't know whether um you want to perhaps if you could circulate the final draft effect so counselors can put and um um I'll open it up now to questions for stuff unless staff would like to comment at all no we had the report from yani so I'll open it up to questions from from councillors uh sam yeah thanks just a quick one and I just thought it's useful if we can do this in public particularly because it does affect our areas quite significantly so 4.3 where it talks about uh tree removal will be considered where the tree is causing or likely to cause significant damage to buildings could you could you end you know in the rest services property in that can you just talk me through if because we get it raised I've had four in the last sort of seven days uh if so if there's a tree on a boom that's either wrecking the footpath or creating uncertainty um this allows for that to be um I guess I'm trying to understand what does the word considered mean in terms of the likelihood of that tree getting removed so can someone just explain to me of the damage what engineering solutions are available and whether the footpath or the property can be fixed without removing the tree so there'll be a balancing act of what's the importance of the tree the value of the tree versus the infrastructure around it and how import how critical that infrastructure is to fix it right so and then just the only other one is around if so if you have that situation and the community board now have approval to um I guess you know approval to remove the tree um how does that fit in with the rules within the district plan so if we go down this process where a tree's causing significant issues what again what would the likelihood be of that getting a consent if it's needed to to remove it so there'll still be the district plan requirements just came with it um so yes the district plan requirements um are such that it could be a permitted activity if the damage was uh significant enough so that's the sort of consistent wording with policies we're so when we talk about considering as toby's pointing out we've got to take into a number of factors and then whether it meets the permitted activities of the plan and whether it's a staff delegation so it could be a decision that's made by staff if it's though even above that then it probably doesn't meet any of those tests and so it would come to the board for a decision one final one leonardo so just so I can be really really clear the policy now gives us and again it's more for people that have raised it locally than necessarily answering myself the policy now gives us a really clear framework on if there are issues outside somebody's home to work through how we remove that tree and replace it with with something else is that fair to say yes and it'll be a pr it's a pragmatic approach it's not gonna we're not gonna end up where we are now where we have significant issues trying to move things along it's a pragmatic what to assess it on and how to come to an end decision it doesn't mean you're going to get a binary result at the bottom you know yes no I suspect because if if the tree is clearly causing damage to infrastructure and there's a bit of a value for money equation going on here can we mitigate that this is the the you know in terms of the impact on infrastructure or not um a lot of those decisions are made under staff delegations so you'll go you are going to get the trickier ones to deal with um but there are clear criteria for you to evaluate now which were missing up until this time okay thank you any more questions uh james very briefly it's just my own clarity so in the event that um we've gone through actually just what sam just articulated and the community board was of the mind to make the decision for that tree to be removed actually am I correct that's the decision or because it's outside of the policy is that it's probably a legal question actually no she's gone um typically if community boards are making decisions that are um not consistent with council policy yes it would be a party so that's a recommendation then that then goes to council for them to make the decision it's a pretty safe assumption yeah okay aaron and just as a follow-on from sam and james the um so if a community board decides to remove the tree does that then trigger a resource consenting of so who pays and it would only be in some circumstances because some trees aren't protected so so only the ones with the orange tags would require because I thought under the district plan once over a number of meters that's it you're protected they are protected that's what I mean they have to be a certain size etc well it's basically just in the power lines and that's it they're protected they make it they're free so then that would require resource consent so now it costs thousands of dollars to remove the before that except we got to say can we remove the track it's gone through a whole lot of checks and balances before it gets to you generally so we deal with the majority of them and yes when they come through to you it would have we would have looked at all the other engineering possibilities for retention of the tree or whether that damage if you're talking about damaged infrastructure whether it is critical and it would have gone through that assessment already before it came to the community board to make that decision but yes if the community board and the same as the question now yeah then the report because the report will normally say um this tree is healthy it stays unless they're really manky like the ones in belfast don't even know the ones I mean but the majority will pass the test and be recommended to stay but if the community board's open mind to still remove that tree there will be a resource consent requirement and what's the cost of that it depends on the processing to pay for that or the council or I don't know the answer to whether I thank you for for the community board to make a you know well-informed decision I think it'll be important for us to put those facts in front of the community what is the true cost right so the problems that have been raised for the last several years not don't really itself today today I don't know the problems that have been you've been dealing with the last several years but it is a case-by-case basis yes I think remembering too there's not that many I know you I know you different boards get different types of inquiries we're not talking hundreds of reports coming through here yeah it's exceptions can I just be really clear for members we had a policy that wasn't a policy that has not been in the council for well it depends which years you want to take 18 or 25 years we now have for you a clear policy which we can then assess against the requests wherever they or they won't but there is also a clear line in which decisions can be made they will go to the community boards advice will be given by officers clearly that needs to be and I think council mcdonough's world is word is right pragmatic and fair weighing up all factors you will be given that information at community board level you will then be able to see whether you agree with that advice if the advice is to remove and you agree with that or not and if the advice is to to keep and you disagree then there is a route to come to council as I understand it yeah so clear policy in which to be able to act um I had sarah but you finished your questioning because that was an interruption I guess it was an addition um but so that it doesn't seem really any different to what we've had because we're still going to go through the same process you still need a resource consent of it's like is it six meters four or four straight three departures yeah six and ten yeah I think it's important to sorry to recognize that um within the district plan rules what's a permitted activity allows council to undertake work as an operational activity so the policy tries to clarify what those permitted activities are by spelling out under these circumstances we will remove trees and those circumstances where we won't_''_625.04 which will then require resource consent and then potentially go to the board also to make a decision I can't imagine many circumstances where they will then go on to council to further that because the policy allows for those um criteria to be considered by the board to make that decision if that because the whole purpose of the policy is to clarify that whole decision-making process if it doesn't then so when the trees on our land damaging someone else's property who's paying for the resource consent a resource consent may not be required if it meets the test of doing committed activity yeah and if it doesn't do significant damage yeah which would need to be assessed or roading infrastructure footpaths curtin channel is considered to be low level infrastructure right we can fix it through our maintenance what we're talking about then is significant um infrastructure which has a um uh for the health and safety purpose um or then damages to private property which is then a matter we have to deal with the private resident over right so we're capped the damage to our property well we have to understand the trees yeah I'm just finding where the line is that's all yeah yeah it's understanding the damage it's low level damage to the degrees of significance we're getting into very specific and in you know it's all subject non-defined sort of matters but I i understand what you're trying to do what what what the guys are trying to explain is that you have criteria now by which you can assess that you didn't have in the past right yeah because we have four and five inch tripping hazards in our wards that people complain about constantly and I mean how do we need of a tripping hazard there which is a trapping it might be quite helpful because I mean obviously you're talking from the benefit of experiencing the the representations to you to your board and and um not feeling that the lack of a policy was able to achieve anything I mean I've just wondered whether we could take the two particular examples that you've raised offline and um see whether we can test them against the the policy um because that might short track um fast track we do have some stations I'm sorry we do have some specific things around uh repairs for footpath around pruning routes to allow that if it is a threat it's quite clear in the new policy yeah so we've got some really clear statements around that also around when we would uh removal would be triggered to repair infrastructure around it and that would depend on the infrastructure and the value of the tree so we have addressed that in within the policy as well but it might be that walking through the actual examples with the solve that problem you may recall at the briefing toby mentioned that he'll be going to the joint community board seminar and then available to work with community boards so we'll take live examples through through a scenario so you can sort of see it in action but I think there's nothing like the two irritants for the councillor to actually see how the policy would apply actually yep we'll take a chainsaw when we go to aaron's community yeah sarah thank you um just to get an idea I know we hear people come around you know um and prune trees on and off around around the neighborhood and things how much does it cost council to remove a large tree in the stream like yeah on the on the boom so with contractors traffic management all of those kind of things but what are some of the types of costs that you've seen in relatively recent times to remove a tree um the the contracts are presently uh priced on a schedule of rates so there is that there is a fixed size of tree yeah um the mature tree level of road level two level one so a mature tree on like a neighborhood street okay um typically about and then if you're including total cost stuff binding et cetera et cetera placement cost traffic management thrown in um since about one and a half two thousand dollars okay including replacing the tree or just reinstate them to the ground um just to including stunt and then replacements on top of that because the standard tree the the two thousand dollar mark okay the traffic management component everyone's going that sounds really cheap so what sort of size tree is that that is an over 10 metre size tree wow that's really cheap council gets good rates yeah yeah yes we do oh and what about replacement of the retail rate which what replacement experience is considerably more than that it's almost just because of the maintenance yeah yeah it's almost as much as removable yeah thanks all right are there any more questions for staff now um are we able to um yanni are you a bulk set of resolutions or does that not work for you yes what what have you done to eight in terms of the bottom one sorry okay we've got an I've added in enabling these issues to be considered as part of the tree policy implementation and development of the urban forest plan so I've repeated the words from the one above so that it's quite clear that in looking at potential changes to the district plan that we're we're reviewing that at the moment under the mps ud requirements but this will enable um that information to uh be dealt with this year as part of the treatment yeah I just want to get a clear time frame for when we can get briefed on that not the actual plan change yeah I'm not going to put a date in I just don't want to put a date in right now um but we can circulate a memo on the time frame I mean I'm not happy with that apart from it the rest are fine all right well it sorry sorry you're moving it and you're seconding it um so I'll just open it up for debate um so melanie would you like to kick off the debate yep um I wasn't really going to say um too much I mean we um we had a good um hearings experience I thought um and we spent quite a lot of time working through this and you can see all the wording changes yet me and yani between us had like 50 questions and it took hours so and what we tried to do with all those requests or noting provisions was to try and address all the um all the things that people came to us to talk about and the two I wanted to just mention in the um in this debate was um one was about trees and booms people talked about that having um and there's been another one we've had an email about just now where there's trees and booms they get taken out people want them replaced but then they can't_''_1095.2 be replaced because of we wanted to make sure they're sort of washed for the future because people want trees in their streets especially when they're streets called tall tree air for instance um and then the other point was a lot of people came talking about um natives versus exotics and a lot of people want to see natives and of course it's part of you know I tried multiple ways to give toby to ed and wording around having indigenous trees looked at first um but we do now have the wording in 1.3 um about including um council's other plans and strategic objectives so that will cover the urban forest plan when that's done and I'm hoping that will be done quite quickly because people are very passionate about this including my community board chair person as we know um so um otherwise I think um it's good that we've got this policy and and I'm happy to support it um in all the um all these other provisions as well sarah thank you um trees have an enormous value to a deception they provide habitat visual immunity and they provide shade and they provide shade not just for people but also to the road surface and help with roading maintenance and all the expense of that over time individual trees however can cause a nuisance to individual residents leaves on roofs a route coming causing uplift on the footpath those kind of things but these things can be fixed by regular maintenance trees have a value they have their intrinsic value but also an accumulated value to council and ratepayers in the purchase planting and ongoing maintenance and from the time on the tree policy working group a few years ago many larger trees will have had up to twenty thousand dollars spent on them um to get them to a large size and there are costs of removal as we've heard um although it sounds like council gets a much better rate than regular residents which is great contractors traffic management and then to replant boards have struggled with this for years they haven't had a proper framework to be able to assess things against and this gives individual trees if we make this poll if this policy made it easy to remove trees I have no doubt that boards would be inundated and we would quickly drop our canopy canopy cover from 11 to something even more disastrous look thanks sarah well said I'd really um this is an auspicious day actually because it has been a long time coming um and I like the resolution I like the way that we've managed to compromise and keep these future works built in and this is um well it's a growing policy let's say that but particularly I'd like to thank yani and melanie for the incredible amount of work that you put in I know it nearly drives you mad but you have put in a huge amount of work for us on this so I'd really like to express thanks for doing that and appreciate that this is an auspicious day thanks to you guys so I'll support it yeah thank you so uh thank you um I just want to start off with a quote um which is is going to get better it's not that's from the lorax right that was an overwhelming sentiment from the submitters what we were told very clearly is that people value trees but that we have a huge problem we have a huge problem in the fact that a huge number of trees post earthquake have been lost and that we need to act with some urgency and some care um here's just to quote one of the submissions I've lived in the inner city for 12 years I've seen a large number of established trees fell the reason given are always the trees are unhealthy the remaining stumps and branches show otherwise I'm outraged at the recent filling of around 8 healthy trees from the red zone around river road and havenside drive now there is no shade birds have lost valuable nesting places for a so-called garden city I feel we're headed in the wrong direction since the earthquakes we have had wonton destruction and removal of many prime trees by both council and developers what's really clear is that post taking an opportunity to protect our trees we weakened our tree protection we now have one of the lowest levels of tree canopy cover compared to other major cities in new zealand we do need to act urgently not just on public realm but on private realm as well and that's why I'm disappointed in number eight to have no clear date or time frame to act with urgency to care about the protection of trees within our city you can see the developments happening in the suburbs and especially in the medium residential areas where whole sites are just being absolutely cleared of mature trees and what we heard through the tree policy is that it will take decades and decades for the carbon that's been lost to be replenished by what's proposed to be replanted if it ever does at all so we are making some subtle changes to our tree policy to require when we do things on public land to provide a greater carbon compensation and I think that's to be welcomed so the idea of two for one isn't time taken to get um the loss of the environmental impact uh restored thank you so I just wanted to just just finalize with three points one is what's really clear is we need good data and there's a resolution to do it we need a better model of valuation that acknowledges the environmental benefits of trees and we do need to look at our private district planning around uh trees on private property thank you I'll um put the motion all those um interfered like yours um number eight um recorded differently I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carried how do you want me to record I'd mate then could you just do it just a note support yeah can we can we just note that yeah thank you thanks very much and thank you to staff too that's um it's been a journey my first week in council went to the community goals and they said to me
To deputations by appointment item 3.2 which is in relation to item 20 which we will deal with immediately following uh the deputations so could I begin by inviting canterbury cricket trust lee robinson to come forward thank you bishop and councillors thank you for this opportunity I have on my right trevor watt from fields architects who can answer any queries about the building itself and jeremy phillips from novo on any planning issues but this primarily is simply seeking the council's consent to the new building that is proposed uh the lease was granted in favor of the trust uh for sport and recreation in on the 31st of march to 2018 after which 17 after we purchased the building and this is an application simply to consent to the building that is now proposed it changes the footprint from what was originally agreed or proposed simply because the council in consultation with the trust sought and obtained funds from sport new zealand for the changing rooms toilets and showers that they agreed to fund provided those were in place by the time of cricket world cup facilities 200 square meters or thereabouts will be contained within the hagley sports centre building traffic and archery inquiries and relationships good morning so just sort of touch on increased footprint of 95 square meters so previously we looked at having the same footprint on the building so when this opportunity came up to increase the um functionality with the changing room and giving it the dual use to support the actual hagley southampton clark sports grounds it required a slightly larger changing rooms and also increased facilities with some showers and also toilets so we looked at trying to keep that footprint as tight as possible but still meeting the sport requirement sport new zealand requirements so a lot those requirements was based on there was a two million dollar fund in total around getting more gender neutral more accessible facilities for for community use but it is actually tied into the as a legacy project for qriket world cup so the facilities themselves will be used for it but it's not the prime focus of needing a change room for that event but it is a legacy where there's sort of the I guess the connection and likewise lincoln had a similar fund to improve facilities at lincoln university so that was and so the overall building area is slightly um reduced so we have least upper floor but obviously the footprint has increased because all the functions that require need to be on on that ground floor but happy to answer any other questions about children to sign that's good thank you councillors any questions I think some I don't know if you've seen the memo from all the email from die lucas that raised a number of concerns around the proposed design and had some I thought quite reasonable suggestions around reducing the visual impact of it have you got a response to those concerns because they did seem quite reasonable and just looking at the design it does seem by just being white it is quite obtrusive compared to what could have been done with more earthy tones yeah so I did respond to that memo I'm not sure if you got a copy of my response but I at quite closely around the coloring of the building and the analytic time into the in the context and we kind of it's not really a building that sort of sits within a sort of broader landscape when you look at it from the different perspectives from the north east from the car park you do see the building against the existing pavilion and also the car park with this tree line down the left-hand side from the oval side which is the north northwest you also see it in the context of the backdrop of trees but also see in the context of the pavilion itself and you don't see it from the hagley erv side because of the trees and from the southern uh eastern side you see it against the grounds when sort of shared to to degree but you also see it in relation to the pavilion so when we looked at this sort of context I kind of felt that it actually read better readings part of the language tying into the to the pavilion language itself as opposed to um you know to something else because when you look at existing building it has a number of sort of ranges of browns and and grays and beiges but it doesn't actually just because you paint a building a series of browns doesn't necessarily make it um blend into into the environment so when looked at holistically we felt that it read better having a connection with materiality with the with the other cricket pavilion on the adjacent to it right and then the second question I had was just in regards to funding are you going to apply for council for funding for the development we have enough funds either committed we'd expect by by the middle of april we have enough funds I've committed um or paid to demolish and build shell outside of the building we won't start unless we had those funds in place we're not applying for any council funds at all for this project it was purchased by way of a very generous advance by stephen block and his wife who advanced the money to the trust interest free and the zealand for example from this richard hadley trust um 800 000 and other donations that have been made across the time that we've owned the building and sought private funding so we're not seeking your council funding for this now you know thanks uh any other questions thank you very much and you know an incredible amount of generosity involved in that answer to that question so I just want to acknowledge that hands off hagley martin meehan welcome right thank you very much for listening to what I have to say first of all just a reminder that the purpose of hagley park is to provide open space for recreation for the citizens of christchurch and any building or expansion of a building by definition reduces that space and you can say it's only a little bit in whether it's this case or any other it's only a little bit it won't matter but that's uh you're sort of working on the theory of nobody will miss a slice out of an open loaf eventually yeah you do it's just facility the training facility is allowed and I have no objection to that it's under the ccrp but I am concerned about the proposal by canberry cricket trust for the new sports center which goes way beyond what was originally envisaged which was a cricket training facility indoor one so we've gone beyond that with futsal and netball etc and if you compare what's being proposed with action sports and what they provide they're strikingly similar uh canterbury cricket have a close relationship to action sports in that their admin offices are based at action sports in hornby uh and I believe their commercial manager at canterbury cricket is also the managing director of action sports so there's there's a lot of sort of cross-fertilization going on here and the the hagley sports center looks like a mirror image of what is actually a very well-run successful business action sports in in hornby and uh I believe canterbury cricket and the cricket trust have taken this approach and they claim that the income derived from any hiring out of the facilities is to pay original proposal which doesn't use any more land you wouldn't have to hire the hire it out to raise money to pay for it it's it's sort of a circular argument the sports center is proposed to be open from six am until midnight seven days and of course if you're charging for the use of it this makes it a commercial building uh you're not hiring it out as far as I i know to the the football association or the hockey association this is for uh just the same as action sports it'll be kids cakes bakers playing netball against the city council accounts team and and you pay a fee for that and and there's a need for that sort of thing around obviously but I don't think it should be in hagley park as a commercial facility now this oh sorry can we cricket trust claim they'll be providing public facilities well needed public facilities in in that part of hagley park in that they'll be allowing the public to use the uh the toilets it the the changing rooms are on the side of the building and the toilets are in the middle and you access the toilets from the changing rooms so you've got the door going backwards and forwards and the door to the toilets opens to the outside also so anybody coming in will have access to the change room so of course when the building is in use the toilets will be closed because you just can't have people running through the change rooms from the outside so you would wonder how much of a public facility this will be you know the uh they'll be available when not being used by the sports facility and the more the sports facilities used the less the toilets will be available and it means these sort of alleged public toilets will be open at various times between 6 am to midnight and if you're looking for a public toilet it's a fairly dodgy proposition you get there and places locked up because somebody's in there playing cricket or netball or whatever and the changing rooms also are the cricket trusts going to do are they going to say yes we can have school boys or something in there using the change rooms or we can take the money from people renting the facilities to help pay for it so I think it's you've got a perverse incentive there they say they'll provide these facilities but the incentive is not to provide them because they're using them for somebody paying for them so it's it's not really providing public facilities the upstairs area is an area designated workspace which seems to have a lot of desks in it and then two meeting rooms or boardrooms but you wouldn't think it seems an awful lot of workspace and what is it and we've been told that it's uh to be used by administrators associated with the facility which is fairly loose terminology who's going to be associated with the facility is this a move to get the offices of canterbury cricket back and and into hagley oval which makes a lot of sense from their point of view allowed to do that uh you know the size of this workspace slash office facility is about six double garages now this uh also provision for eleven new car parks along the side of the building I think I think it's ten or eleven but that's also more space that's lost from hagley park it's a grassed area that then becomes a car park but that's not included I don't think in the footprint it's just you know with canterbury cricket and the cricket trust there's always an element of mission creep we start off with one thing and the next thing you know we've moved on and moved on and there's always a timeline on it now the resource consents for the building in 2018 221 would describe it was described as a major sports facility and this has huge ramifications for hagley park a major sports facility is not allowed in there and it's about the third attempt by cricket to have the oval uh designated as a major sports facility and this gives you some sort're likely to be headed in 5 10 20 years time and just one one sort of thing that a major sports facility will allow is a building of 20 meters 20 meters high as of right in a major sports facility and that could happen in hagley park it doesn't say how many buildings but you know you've got to have be mindful of this and so I would ask that the council re reject the plans for this one and just encourage christchurch cricket trust to go back to their original plan and just bear in mind that you are the guardians of hagley park it's a uh it's the public commons of christchurch and if you think that's a bit of a quaint term it meshes in very very well with the the the maori concept of uh kaitiyanga tangy and it's you are the kaitiaki of hagley park and the decision you make sets the trend for this so yes thank you very much thank you we've got time for a couple of questions sarah templeton thank you you correct summary to say that the two key points you're saying are stay within the current footprint yeah and don't let other sporting groups use it well just stay away from the temptation to be commercial if you think there's going to be a need for all these indoor facilities I i would remind you that the apollo center in jelly park is looking for tenants and they're currently what is it they've got a full-size netball court strength conditioning gym 40 mil 40 meter running straight and showers and this is but the main thing is yes but the main thing is to stay within the current footprint okay so if they would you have an objection to them actually rebuilding the building within the current footprint the actual design and color and bits and pieces itself well I think the other the other side of that coin is the commercialization of but if that was up to them is it the it's not the design it's the footprint and the commercialization yeah yeah okay thanks thank you any other questions thank from christchurch civic trust professor chris kissling and so right that's been distributed now so you can begin the presentation thank you good morning marin councillors mr microphone thank you thank you for accepting our request today the canterbury qriket trust is no doubt expecting you to rub a stamp approval of its request on the face of it an apparently innocuous request to demolish and rebuild the hagley sports centre however as we all know appearances can be deceiving the christchurch civic trust contends that the staff report cannot be relied upon for the purpose of the council's decision making today it emits or obscures relevant information the canterbury cricket trust request must be considered in the following context the resource consent granted to that trust in 2018 for a major sports facility a non-complying activity in respect of the former horticultural hall building and the council's receipt of a resource consent application dated 3rd of march 2021 also for a major sports facility a non-complying activity in respect of that building under the heading legal implications paragraph 8.8 in the staff report confirms the report unit statements in paragraphs 4.1 5.16 and 9.1 relate to the avoidance of delay such statements in the staff report have the effect of placing you as decision makers under duress to approve the request today relying on the staff report alone the staff report states the proposed uses for quicker training and coaching together with community-based sports not disclosed in the report is the relevant fact that the canterbury cricket trust requires approval from the council as the administering body for hagley park under the reserves act in order to develop a major sports facility on the leased area occupied by the hagley sports centre a use which has never been undertaken on the site in the past such a use being inconsistent with the christchurch district planned zoning for hagley park not disclosed in the staff report is the relevant fact that the 2018 non-notified resource consent was granted to the canterbury cricket trust for a non-complying activity in the district plan namely a major sports facility in haiti park not disclosed in the staff report under the heading other legal implications is the relevant fact that the the proposed building is dated third of march 2021 and has been received by the council the canterbury cricket trusts application requests non-notification as in 2018 and consent for a non-complying activity namely a major sports facility in hagley park the staff report states the proposed building remains within the existing lease area the staff report does not disclose the relevant fact that the existing lease area is located at hagley oval and thus subject to the requirements of the christchurch central recovery plan the location of the hagley sports centre or former horticultural hall at hagley oval is confirmed in an appendix to the 2013 environment court interim decision in the 2007 happy park management plan and in published statements based on richard hadley the croatian city council and canterbury cricket and those are included in the in the attachment the 2018 resource consent for a major sports facility appears to have been granted in breach of section 60 of the greater christchurch regeneration act councils not to act inconsistently with plan in relation to the recovery plan and I quote any person exercising powers or performing functions under or recommendation relating to all or part of greater christchurch that is inconsistent with the plan on any of the following matters under the resource management act 1991 and includes an application for resource consent for a non-complying activity whether or not the application was first lodged after the plan was gazetted the chief executive mayor and councillors were all sent an email on the 4th of march 2021 last week from the christchurch civic trust which drew the section 60 legal issue to your attention it cannot simply be ignored the 2018 consent permitted a major sports facility a non-complying activity inconsistent with the specified outcomes and mandatory requirement in the cricket oval anchor project in the christchurch central recovery plan and I quote the essential village green character of hagley park will also be kept whilst providing a domestic and international purpose-built qriket venue including training and coaching facilities with indoor and outdoor nets the plan's vision of the scale of the developed cricket oval within higley park did not include a major sports facility we respectfully remind you of your particularly strong opposition to the use proposed for hagley oval in regenerate christchurch's draft proposal the council's 4th of september 2019 letter to regenerate christchurch stated that it quote would risk future development of a scale that is completely contrary to the village green and community park character of hagley park reference to a major sports facility in relation to hagley oval in the district plan was subsequently removed from the proposal to the minister the staff report refers to the 2017 assignment of the lease from the canterbury horticultural society the canterbury cricket trust however the second of february 2017 staff report did not disclose the wording of the mandatory requirement in section 115 of the reserves act regarding the transfer of a lease the administering body shall not grant its consent to transfer of a lease unless the transferee is a voluntary organisation whose aims and objects are similar to those of the lessee the staff report did not disclose the aims and objects of the canterbury horticultural society nor evidence of their similarity or otherwise or those of the canterbury cricket trust for the purpose of the full council's decision council assigned the lease to the canterbury quicket trust in apparent breach of section 115 in circumstances where a new lease application should have been made by the canterbury cricket trust the 2017 staff report did not disclose whether that report had been reviewed and approved by the legal services unit the 1991 lease for the area occupied by the former horticultural hall is no longer fit for purpose having been drawn up for the canterbury horticultural society 30 years ago a new lease is required a process requiring public consultation under the reserves act since the 1991 lease does not provide for or anticipate a major sports facility the council is less or cannot grant approval for a major sports facility proposal disguised and the staff report to you as a sports centre but disclosed in resource consent documents as a major sports facility a non-complying activity in terms of the district plan I will take the next section that you've got on that paper there which says away forward has been read and I'm substituting the paper which is the addendum in her letter of 10th the council of sarah templeton as chair of the hagley park reference group the chief executive responds on several operational matters one of which refers to the 2018 resource consent the chief executive says and I quote we apologize for the staff error in not providing a copy of the 2018 application to the hpig for comment however as the 2018 consent has been issued I see little value in litigating this further unquote an apology does not resolve the issue little value in litigating this further to whom we ask there is enormous value to the many users of haggy park now but even more importantly for future users who will have to experience their part with a major sports facility in msf at all its effects cricket might not want this anomaly to be revisited as it would expose the huge commercial valley to them of having a consent for a major sports facility in hagley park at hagley oval the msf is like yeast in bread making it helps expand the dough on the one hand crickets are playing a long game to consolidate their position within the need for haste to be able to meet the demands of pending international fixtures they have twice used special earthquake related powers to advance their cause and circumvent the hagley park management plan they sought their 2018 resource consent non-notified to avoid public scrutiny they are again today seeking haste and placing the council under duress with his current application it is cricket versus the rest with an umpire that has vested interest in the result that empire has the opportunity to demonstrate neutrality in an open manner the resource consent has not yet been implemented so you can do something that something is for council to formally review this consent to remove the msf element you owe it to the future residents of the city I think sorry just um comes to the conclusion of the ten minutes so thank you very much uh for your deputation today thank you the next is lindsay castle oh good morning councillors mia good morning welcome I've given you um what I'm going to say and I'll read it out bob but I might shorten a little bit came with it these emails have been collected a while back but they show the interaction between the council and canterbury cricket and other organizations I'll come back to them shortly um they were retained under the local government act so there's there was no nothing you know wrong there or anything like that and I will just mention there that they detail the interaction between the various groups here one of the problems with aging is that you lose some of your facilities and I can no longer read properties real paint on the book anyway part b christchurch city council star are not independent from canterbury cricket there is a close unfair and long standing and unhealthy relationship between the applicant and the council this is evident from the attached emails with the council staff have championed canterbury cricket in various stages of they had the oval developments ignoring the concerns of other groups the emails show the staff were not neutral instead were out of the public eye and and actively promoting the ambitions of canterbury cricket point c the decision this is what I application sits on will rest on the table until the resource consent has been application by canterbury cricket trust can be considered on a publicly notified basis because of hagley park status as a city-wide asset with the application first referred to the hagley park reference group and then referred to an independent commissioner for processing then a more fully considered and completed this purpose could be brought back to council further the public will be able to express their views representing non-cricket recreation users for the park that's really what I want to say but I just want to go over oh sorry there's a bit more there the council being the administrative body exercising delegated powers under the reserves act should take into account the interests of all stakeholders who use this city treasure it includes me too I quite go for a walking park the emails I'm going to go through all of them but there's a couple I would like to comment on page 11. I numbered them all so we could quickly get to them you got them there in front is right away back 2012. email simply says for your information minister mccully will be visiting us on friday that's all I knew nowhere else any other emails fine getting I asked the council they had no information I went to sport new zealand and they admitted that they had attended it but everybody was very reluctant so I had to get the ombudsman thank goodness we have an ombudsman in new zealand and he investigated it and he basically in his report when he got back to me and said that they had no records of it and he said went on to say that the breaches the public records acted he was referring it to somebody else but I don't know if anything actually ever happened after that but I spot new zealand because I kept pestering them did finally come back and they did admit that they were they had some information in their minutes meetings where they commented on what the visit counted um they go on to say he thought new zealand said to me that the council had declined a cricketer's now I never knew anything about that this is it also support new zealand which is what I found quite interesting the decision reinforced the tension between city council and central government over the park so this central government was involved in this also in a big way but a lack of record keeping already mentioned on that the public records is a real concern that the council was doing as well as support new zealand all right turn to page 19. here we have emails between staff with um between john pasell and michael eight kid came along for here and in thompson and it goes on to say that the legal opinion now there's there's build up to this sarah the legal advisor canterbury earthquake canada earthquake recovery authority their legal advisor suggested that you get a legal opinion the ministers agreed that a legal opinion was produced and the legal opinion said it's not as easy as you think it's going to be the minister will have to sign off on a um order in council the minister declined that and so it range of emails here where we have um an email they are going on about the fact that the legal opinion obtained just the ordinary council would be needed et cetera and that's why there was a discussion about roger losing interest in the whole oval project and the staff suggested how to get around the problem so the plan is in the blueprint therefore the the hagley oval management plan now allows for this to happen well I disagree with that anyway then on page 22 find a little piece there we have a letter an email addressed to me from michael aikens and the interesting part there is how he says there that to the best of my knowledge no staff member has assisted sarah gonna be earthquake recovery authority or is my case that's what I want to say except that please think very carefully what you're going to do with this this agreement I would strongly recommend that you get further information on it you that lie on the table thank you questions are sarah templeton thanks so much and thanks for being us to do both you and the previous group have provided lots of context to background information and some technical and legal stuff it's for you the same as the other group where it's the major sports facility framing within that 2018 consent that's the issue um is that what you want fixing in the consenting because that wasn't particularly clear why why do they keep coming back wanting this so but but what are you wanting fixing in the consenting in the lease what is it that you would like fixed in it before we before we um look at it again wouldn't it be better to to go through and get the resource consent part sorted out first then release so what is it about the consenting that you would like I'm just trying to be really clear on what you're asking us to do with the consenting well I would hope that getting the resource consent would be the first step rather than won't be doing it round back to the front okay but this is the lease is't_''_2261.839 be an effect until her consents granted what is it about the consent that you really want us to look at in detail the previous group are clear that it's the term major sports facility and the implications of that well I think actually the the term major sport specifically should be removed from any any documents okay it's got all sorts of connotations which which we don't know what where that would lead to and what it could lead to yeah that's that's great thank you that's just perfect in to the timing so thank you very much lindsay much appreciated thank you next we have susan williams yes see whether I'd be allowed to read it into the public record yeah for sure you'll have to sit at the table though so thank you so I'm speaking for sue williams council's long-term park service plan to 2028 approved by andrew rutledge and mary richardson who also approved today's item 20's report describes residents strong affinity with their parks and open spaces which is a key of that very large number of residents council reports are formatted but issues must still be thoroughly addressed at 1.4 it identifies two issues that led to a conclusion this decision is of low significance under council's significance and engagement policy I consider this a cynical minimization of hagley park the report itself identifies the site as high profile and it certainly is nationally and under international standards and in the box below you can see why and in the significance policy hagley park is a schedule one strategic asset in that policy considerations also cover likely impact on asset and consequences which must be applied here you also have management responsibility to us under five acts listed below in the next box and under the ccrp and the district plan today it involves a reserves x decision but that does not mean you should turn a blind eye to those other obligations not to consequences for hagley park because they are significant nor to consequences for hagley park because they are significant the report significance assessment also concluded the proposal is largely a replacement of a like the at 5.21 it is for a proposed use that has generally existed in the past and to some extent is likely to be of a similar scale to use as in the past although some increase in daily operation is possible and at 5.18 for other community sports users the frequency of additional use is not clear at 5 14 it states it will enable cricket double headers to be played i.e four teams to be hosted at one time if consequences are then factored in the like-for-like argument disappears with doubled intensity of activity greater public exclusion inconvenience for other park users and hospital access issues compounding today's decision is the fact that the building can be used as a major sports facility via the 2018 resource consent processed and approved non-notified for council and that changes everything an msf means bigger structures commercialization commercialism the activities of a scale frequency and intensity way beyond past users or like for like and with huge impacts and consequences for hagley park to make things worse the council-established haggy park reference group sits at level three and four on the kept even from our community representatives despite all resource consents relating to hagley park having to go to that group under its terms of reference before being processed by this council as a decision maker the report references the 2018 consent at 5.9 but for a multi-use sports centre with no mentioning of major sports at facility the park staff similarly fudged the issue at page 174 stating there is no reference in the consultation material to major sports facility instead cct's consultation document refers to a multi-use facility this created another issue that council did not fully inform the public in december 2020 what exactly they were being consulted on as the msf hiding in the wings of the proposal hadi building was not disclosed had the public known I consider critical responses would have flooded in in 2019 a strategic partner council responding to cctv regenerates gcra act section 71 proposal expressed its strong objection to a major sports facility in hagee park such that it was removed from what the minister approved it would be the height of hypocrisy if an msf established there now and for stated the council will suffer reputational damage if the facility is not completed for the women's cricket world cup I consider if you approve the decision today and leave the mscf element unaddressed the compounding intensification at hagley oval will make it impossible for council to sustainably manage haiti park for the community and reputational damage will most surely come from residents significance considerations also include the capacity of a local authority to perform its role firstly council's role of sustainability managing haggy park for current or future well-being of the community will be unworkable while the mscf elephant in the room remains secondly the council must make decisions that are consistent with the the report at 5.3 incorrectly quoted the ccrp by ignoring its requirement that village green characteristics are to be retained at the oval if you leave this decision on the table today remove the msf filament in the resource consent and then approve a building that the ccrp stipulates for training and coaching facilities with indoor nets and no more it could be timely built that would better retain the village green be maintain council's capacity to perform your role of sustainable park management council's obligations to residents and future generations rightly carry on across the electoral terms equally significant negative impacts on hagley park will carry on and compound if you as a group today box on without addressing the issues outlined please pause and treat this decision and haggy park the gravitas they deserve and thank you from soon williams thank you very much and thank you for having that read into the record much appreciated right now councillors we'll move on to item 20 and the
We've had advice that uh that I can put number two uh separately but if if number two is fails and I want to foreshadow a motion that asks that the matter be brought back for a decision once the resource consent is resolved so so I'll just foreshadow that I couldn't amend it can I foreshadow emotion okay all right so mike is moving that would someone like to second that is a foreshadowed motion all right no you can't aaron are you did you put your hand up so you'll you'll second that if if it's required yep all right so um so on that basis I will um split them out yeah okay so I'll deal with number two first um I will actually know I'll deal with one to five first and then I'll deal with number two number two so um with uh so this is resolutions one to five a prep approving the proposal to demolish approving the naming of the new facility when it's built um authorise the property manager to complete above approvals are subject to the lessee complying with all regulatory and statutory requirements including building consent and resource consent so I will put one to five all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried now I'll um put number two but given that there's a a different group around the table could you um poll the members on item two recommendation too councillor kewan oh yes councillor in the pilot yes johansson council of golf yes vote is 10 votes for the motion four against and one abstention that um I declare that carried um and so the uh resolution has been carried so thank you very much and thank you to staff um for uh helping us through the challenge of that last bit so thank you very much listen it's uh 12 54 so rather than commence another item or return to the previous item I don't think we'll deal with it in six minutes but we might get there but I won't take the risk so we will adjourn for lunch and we will return here at 2 p.m thank you you
Um so we'll have the uh we'll we'll start the hearings report and and we'll hear from so that's item 18 and we'll hear from the chair councillor nani johansen we won't conclude this by morning tea so we'll just um well if we don't conclude this by morning tea we will adjourn at 11 o'clock and then we'll um come back to this after we've dealt with the uh item number 20._''_23.76 so um we can't change anything though can you as far as you either accept it or send it back no no because there's a number of recommendations that are not included in the trade policy oh is this the ones that were sent through questionnaires is whether they can be dealt with separately but anyway yani if you could introduce the report on the hearings panel uh yeah um thank you um so just to highlight that the tree policy has been a long time coming uh it's been something that's had working parties and it it got to a community that did get engaged overwhelmingly were concerned that we needed to more to recognize the value and to protect our trees especially with a climate change emergency and the issue of ecology biodiversity and sustainability so as a hearing panel we and there were only two of us melanie and myself so I'd like to acknowledge um counselor melanie coco we listened to what people had said and we came up with a range of recommendations what's important to note is that the urban forest strategy is to be developed and staff to give uh feedback around a lot of the things that were being raised could be done as part of that but there were also issues around particularly around the impact post earthquake of intensification and development in existing communities that had lost a lot of the the tree coverage and so the hearing panel really we tried to balance the policies in terms of the true policy versus the need to get other work happening to recognize the concerns that the submitters had had raised just in terms of the city I mean I people would would like that but in terms of the tree policy um you know I think we've made a lot of um technical changes uh and there's a lot of detail in that and I think we're in a good place I don't think that there's much concern I hope with my colleagues around where we've got to with that we've tried to make it enabling to deal with the concerns that people may raise in terms of the damage to public infrastructure or the impact on a private citizen but we've also got some safeguards just to ensure that that process is robust so really um I think it's probably best I just talked through some of those other recommendations just to be really really clear on the table because the other recommendations are likely to be subject to some discussion so um it's hard to separate out the points that the submitters were making to just the tree policy um and so that's why we've added the additional resolutions so well I don't agree avoid uh amendments to them at the table so we're going to do that but is there anything else about the trade policy paper from the hearings panel point of view that you'd like with respect I don't see you can see these um resolutions as separate than the tree policy paper with deputation you
Not addressing the issues outlined please pause and treat this decision and haggy park the gravitas they deserve and thank you from soon williams thank you very much and thank you for having that read into the record much appreciated right now councillors we'll move on to item 20 and the recommendations from staff uh sit in front of us so if I could invite staff um to present the report I just think just a brief introduction and and perhaps uh addressing some of the some of the issues that have been raised that that need to be responded to thank you thank you and by means of introduction the report in front of you is to consider as landlord effectively whether or not you approve of the modification of the building or in this case deconstruction and reconstruction and also a couple of key points the modified building still sits within the lease area that the canterbury critical trust hold um a lot of the discussion has been about rma matters and I'll just point out that council has received uh the new application for a members of the hadley park reference group so that can be considered thoroughly and comment can be made back to the planners um the notion of or the question relating to do you do a landlord consent first or do you do a resource consent first it's not an uncommon one that we have around many lease situations for facilities on recreation reserves what we it doesn't apply here but I'll just make this comment what we tend to have trouble with is people go and get a resource consent and then they think they're away and laughing and then we have to remind them no you've actually got to get the landlord's approval so you can go both ways frankly um and that's that's something that you may wish to consider today with regard to the terminology major sports facility it is a technical term I believe that as it sits in the district plan that any facility over 300 square meters is termed a major sports facility we already have at least two on headley park we have the netball be termed major sports facilities so that's just to put it in context for you um felix you may wish to elaborate on that or um essentially um that's all we can really add to the to the conversation so far and um happy to answer any questions all right um councillors sarah templeton thanks for clarifying that andrew the so the major sports facility terminology that's used in the 2018 consent refers to the current size of the facility does it allow for a greater facility to be built in the future and if it did wood council still need to do a separate decision to allow that as landholder yes so it does allow for something bigger in the future because it's a facility or that we would still need to make a decision you need to clarify your question are you saying specifically would it allow the canterbury cricket trust to build a larger facility yeah it does just does just having the term maintenance not without further approval so they decided they wanted to put a third story on the building or process as the landlord you have to agree to any modifications to any building yeah okay and um the the footprint of the building does that take up the new footprint it looks like it takes some hard surface and a small sliver of green at the back or is that mostly hard surface that's going on so is it taking more green space away for example it's it's kind of gray space to be frank yeah yeah um yeah there is a moderate modification to the footprint and and you'll be aware that there's a total increase of 70 square meters yeah but no tree removal for any of the building work or anything no thanks um was it was the increase at that at the ground level was that at the request of the council in terms of the access to the the new facilities that would be made available not explicitly um council obviously um are very keen to be able to get access to those changing rooms in particular to support women's cricket on the on the number what we the point to remember is there's always a lot of cricket going on in summer 20 odd games through christ college apollo grounds and all of hospital corner and so forth and there are very few change facilities available so we are very keen to be able to access those buildings for the wider community the canterbury cricket trusts designers designed the building to accommodate that but not explicitly at our request right but it was they were aware that we had a desire to be able to utilise them as a public facility absolutely yeah okay same yeah thanks andrew just a quick one based off ann's presentation which I thought was really useful it just talks about the other under duress and you know the making of decisions are we comfortable in our legal position on proceeding proceeding forward today making a decision on this decision yes vehicle well I'm happy to move it if you need to just as a starting point yep um well I've seconded it then so no no it doesn't matter I'm fine um pauline you're footprint of you saying 70 square meters I thought I heard 95 I think it's 95. I was at 95. 95. my apologies so that's contained in the in the original lease agreement uh what is the usage of that in the lease is that there's green space primarily it is to accommodate those changing facilities so it's truly increasing has been driven by the desire to have improved change facilities and in particular the appropriate facilities to support one female athlete yeah okay thank you okay and then anne yeah I was just interested in the um in our report we were told that the city council on the trust worked on a range of funding initiatives for parks and community organisational projects and that resulted in a 610 000 grant how how was that decided like we've got other projects um that come to mind so we're where was that I can't answer that question sorry that was facilitated by the sport and recreation team um we'd have to get some advice from them the the question we're being the request to well approval to demolish and replace the building so the there is already a lease we're not considering funding no so but without that funding this project wouldn't go ahead no obviously without funding the project will not go ahead but there is no council funding associated to this project we've already heard that we heard that very clearly from the question that was asked so the funding from sport new zealand that goes directly to the trust it doesn't come through council no is that correct no the council has no rule okay um just wanted to check on the this whole issue of commercial use and your sense of what would be permissible under the higley park management plan well under the reserves act no commercial use is permissible right so the idea of having say indoor cricket you know professional um not sorry um uh commercial type people paying to go and play like indoor that's not technically considered commercial use if it's supporting that community sport level for example we have a golf course on hagley park that's consistent all over the country in terms of how community level sport operates so they can have a community level of activity yeah that people pay as long as you cannot go in and use those facilities for commercial gain yeah so as long as the revenue raised from that goes back into the charitable purpose then it's okay it must be a not for profit organisation right how does that impact on say our lease fees or license to occupy charging like how do we work out how much we would charge for the lease of the space I believe it's a pretty standard process that's just the least the rent is the terminal on the base of the sports company community groups policy which is a discounted rate for community groups and sports clubs you'll be familiar with that right this is a non-for-profit um operation but it will have professional use as well it's like all sports facilities do for example has an international hockey facility it can host but it's not the primary use you know those those the other question I had was did we get at what stage would our urban design team provide advice over during the resource contenting process right the application was received on monday it's been shared with the hagley park reference group and it goes through its normal rma process right so in terms of the controls over the lease is there's nothing that we could do in terms of urban design or control of say advertising signage um absolutely you can in the least you can you can state um that there should be no advertising signage that's not uncommon and reserved yeah so have you got any sense of what's permissible and what we may like to restrict look off the top of my head no it is a challenge all over the city if you drive past burnside park right now they have a very large sign for a commercial operator on the community facility yeah um I don't have that policy in my head sorry okay I mean I guess the concerns we work quite closely with clubs to try to support a whole bunch of you know private advertising in hagley park wouldn't be something that would be no that wouldn't be committed under the terms of the lease certainly not in terms of the landlord approval okay not just hagley park all of our parks we we apply consistent policies to all of our parks thank you um we've heard a lot about qriket but um my understanding is that it's also going to be used for other sports can you talk about that a bit more um that's probably a question for the trust actually you know our role here is to put in front of you the modification to the building not the use of the building um in a sporting context yeah it's a very common thing whether it's a school gymnasium or a council building or whatever they tend to want to fill them up and use those spaces so I guess I'm trying to get at the the fact that it will be really beneficial not just to cricket but to the whole community you know youth it can facilitate other activities just like the horticultural hall did yeah exactly um you know remembering it used to be cricket nets and then it was modified yes yeah okay thanks andrew thank you in the um supporting notes and in the deputation from the civic trust under the discussion about the use of the term major sports facility there are a number of bullet points that refer to matters that are not disclosed in the staff report so the requirement of approval by a council of a major sports facility um the 2018 um consenting and also the fact that the resource consent required for the proposed building is dated the third of march 2021 rather than been application pending are any of those things omissions and things that should be reported on or any are any of them relevant to the particular matter we're considering today that's the first of two questions I've got so I guess the biggest challenge whenever you consider a landlord's consent is is the obvious interdependency of an rma decision but technically you are making a decision on and the rebuild of a replacement building on the same side it's very you know council typically doesn't have a role to play in in terms of councils sitting around the table in most rma decisions they're done by independent commissioners so it's very difficult for me to sort of say things are missing because the application for the rma has just been received long after this report was written what I can say about the rma and there are people behind me that can correct me if I'm wrong I'm sure is that the conditions that were part of the consent that the horticultural ball had were the conditions that were no baited across to the trust is that correct so um some of those conditions we're quite uncomfortable with because they are not consistent with the with with the lease that the horticultural society had nor have been transferred across so now that we have a new resource consent application we have that opportunity to address those inconsistencies but through an rma process not this process does that make sense yep made um and I think and I'm gonna ask some clarification here that you andrew referred to in some of your opening comments um lindsay asked the question why would you not get the resource consent approval first and then deal with that these matters and I think I heard you in your opening remarks saying that's an approach you might decide to take and I think it was that matter that you were referring to I mean this is about timing and sequencing but you know is there merit in waiting for the resource application a resource consent application to run its course and the decision to be made prior to granting the approvals would there be any merit or advantage in that um it's hard to say that there's merit or advantage we always encourage people typically to get the landlord's consent before they go to the significant expense because and not for profit before they go to those significant expenses to get a resource consumed so if the landlord has no interest in in adopting a change um why would you go's very difficult to sort of keep the matters separate and we've had this with several situations that have come to the light particularly with hagley park whether it was lights or other matters because I have no idea what the commissioner will look at what the planners will do in terms of applying the rules I don't know if I can honestly answer that question I'm sorry yeah and I mean what you have done is given some rationale for the way that it would be set out in the way it is today and the timing would be in the order that's proposing the paper that's helpful thank you is it appalling mine is probably more a question of the trust but I'll ask andrew anyway but would it be possible for this project to proceed without extending the footprint they would obviously have to that is very much a question for the designers and you can't answer that happy to take advice but I'm quite happy to have the trust come back and answer answer that question if thank you the only reason for the change or the increase was that the specifications for the changing rooms toilets and showers had to be a particular size and and with by if we didn't increase that footprint to accommodate that number one we wouldn't have got the funding and it wouldn't have been a legacy project for christchurch and number two we would have to compromise on the five lanes that we've designed and put in place as a result of the advice that we've received both from new zealand cricket and dale hadley who did international cricket indoor facilities in dubai and elsewhere so for it to be effective for full training situations we need to keep what is regarded as a minimum in terms of the size of the five lanes the size of the changing facilities took it about took it over that over that amount so as has been confirmed it's 95 square meters on the footprint but the ground with the whole building is reduced in size and it's well within the least area of of what least through to 2044 so we're not encroaching on any green space or anything else it's simply within that footprint yes I think it's that we obviously had a design which meant the existing footprint and then the change rooms beefed it up so two two ways we looked at when people asked a question about you know how do you reduce the 4.1 as you do away with the I guess that larger change room and just have a smaller one serving the the training space or you could in theory just carve off a bit of the extra area in the main sports hall when you actually look at what tangible benefit that would be you'd probably take it away from the kind of the stream side or the riverside which the trees and from all public perceptions of the building it'll look exactly the same as what it does now so if your carbs say two meters off the sports hall or three metres reduces the functionality of the main sports hall but you know from practical terms it will look exactly you'll just have a bigger amount of I guess open space between those trees in the building so practically it will still proceed but you would potentially lose a lot of functionality and potentially the dual use and potentially the community use which we just see is beneficial um I'd just add as well for the resource consent process one of the key considerations both in the application but for council and ultimately the commission are deciding will be the differences between the proposed building and the consented building and the existing building so looking at where um comes back in or where it goes further out what space it's occupying what it looks like and whether it's appropriate or not having regard to what the district plan expects for higley park in that zone thank you and certainly would will they also be looking at the issue of creep that we hear about in in brief use um yes that and the appropriateness of the activity yep thank you is this a question for the trust or um right okay will the the with the of that lost open space be to to the trust in other words like what has it been used for I guess over the period up till now uh what was it clarify that the the the land that the building is increasing in its forefront so there's the outside area at the moment what has that that that will be lost when the footprint increases what has it been used for up until this point so the building footprint sits within a larger lease sort of footprint so one point of note that comes back in relation to green space we're actually providing we are providing afterwards the same amount of impervious surfaces so the buildings get bigger but we are providing some more green space on the carpark side to offset the bit of the green space currently there in the building on the on the southern side so the amount of I guess hard standing areas being at ashford or building is exactly the same between now and what we're looking at proposing to do so in theory not the amount of green space yep but my question is what is that exact piece of land used for currently okay so on the south side of the building it's it's just a grass strip against the building which the um groundsman uses for sort of storage space and um and in the past uh on the between the building and the river again it's being used traditionally as outdoor sort of storage space for goal posts and and other sports sort of stuff at the moment so so will those things then be stored inside well the new shed groundsman sheds on around there have been built um now so I believe the intent is a lot of those storage um aspects are will be included within the in the council's grounds sheds we'll get andrew to answer the council site thank you very much for coming back hendry so there's currently a very simple bit of grass type and space there are services under that land um some of that land or just to the side and there's a gravel pathway we are currently putting in old house I'm not sure if you're familiar with with the driveway up to the um the current building on the right that was the old groundsman's house that's where our staff operate out of right now and so once those shedding facilities are finished that will get all removed and returned to open space to improve the overall aesthetic so in terms of what's it used for very little other than storage of a few goal posts and various other so my question for you was going to be why was the lease area including that extra land in the first place why wasn't it just for the footprint of the original building originally all of it that's consistent with all of our community leases we always have a perimeter around the building I'm not sure why we do that felix nice um but that's that's that's exactly how all the leases work all right okay look thank you very much for your um taking of questions sorry sorry um andrew the we've had a couple of park reference group as a whole present what was the overall um feedback from the higley park reference group oh you've got me on the spot now because I haven't okay so I've opened up for minutes yeah um I look I know that the the notion was discussed twice yeah at two independent two individual um reference groups I wasn't at those meetings sorry yeah so I mean the military I can circulate them to people um overall the higley park reference group are supportive of the concept but there were some concerns and questions and they tended to be around the things that were the raised today yeah yeah I think everyone sort of has concerns about the commercialization aspect it's a matter that we struggle to deal with everywhere yeah within reserves that's that okay thank you thank you look thank you very much for your presentation and I've got the uh the matter moved and seconded so I'll open it up for debate sam would you like to start off the debate with the mover only really briefly we would go ahead and do it there's no cost to the council it's effectively replacing light for like in terms of the um the layout and I think it's it's a really useful thing so we should get on and let them do it anyone else uh pauline yeah look I'm really I think the project is admirable I think it's going to tidy up the whole area I think the building looks nice and tidy and losing that caretakers one will help too but I'm just very worried about the creep so um I'm I just can't support two I'll support the rest of it but I'd really like to see them put it back on the same footprint exactly because I know what happens it just goes on and on and on and we have had the deputations in concern and particularly what sarah just read out there they also have concerns about this so I'd really like to see them actually fit back into the same footprint so I will not be sporting two think it's a really good step forward um I think the question with regards to um commercialization is a really tricky one which you alluded to andrew but whether it's this you know martin's bowls club or whatever if organizations can actually um take the heat off council's financial support in any way shape relevant of what the group is I think that we've got to seriously look at that and respect that so thank you thank you um yani oh yeah thank you um yeah I want to acknowledge the generosity that you know we've heard that people have given to this project and I think that's really um to be acknowledged and I'm glad that the mayor referenced that I'm just really concerned around two that I would much rather wait for the consent um so I'm not against what's been proposed but my personal view is that the consent should come first before we approve the lease so that we can address any matters that are raised in that um so the other resolutions I i end of the day like hagley park is such a special place in our city um and to have a resource consent process not be complete ahead of this approving the least raises a real concern with me I did have lot of sympathy for the concerns around the design one thing that I mean and I guess everyone will have personal observations but the white background to the park with the existing pavilion is actually very noticeable and I did a lot of sympathy with some of the comment that was made in the submitters uh submissions around using um different colored tones to reduce the impact but that sort of thing I would hope gets addressed through the resource consent process which is why I'd rather that process occur first before we approve the lease the right is that cricket is now in higley park we do have the pavilion there and really you know this has a lot of synergy with that and I think the other point that we shouldn't lose sight of is the general neutrality of what's being proposed and the I think that's one of the really positive aspects of this for the women's world cup is that we are making alpha or they are proposing to have facilities that are gender neutral which is you know a really significant step forward and you know possibly long overdue but that this is something that is a really positive benefit of this feature so I just ask that you um record my abstention under two because I'd rather wait for the consent I'm just going to say that I'm seeking advice on that because I think that it's just a question of opposing the recommendation because uh the um well it's you can't split it that's what I think but anyway I'm waiting for advice on that um uh thank you very much guys this um I'm supporting this because I think it's the best thing since sliced bread we're getting rid of an old cold bunker that's probably got asbestos in it and turning it into something that's great and for worrying about crete from the old building at the front which is being used for the green keepers is going to be bold and turn into grass so we're actually getting more grass back than what we're we're using up and it's inside the lease area that that they already have so let them do what they like thank you I've got melanie james and andrew and aaron I mean in general I'm in support of um this but I do worry I mean I'm copying what pauline and yani have thought but um I i do um think that um it is a concern about the increasing size and I do understand it's within that leased area but it does make me wonder why least areas are larger than the original building footprint and I do think I'd like to have that resource consent process done first as well so we can add anything else to the lease if we decided as a council to do that so that's where I'm at uh james giorda um I i don't think I to leave shortly but I do want to say that excuse me if this was split I would support everything except for two because I have a I'd like to see a different design so therefore I would be opposed to it all but in principle I like the the idea of what what you're trying to achieve but I do have a problem with the footprint but having said that I have to leave um andrew thank you and likewise as others have said there are some aspects of this that will be taken account of through the resource consenting process um and yeah I mean certainly I note the answer to the question I asked earlier around um timing and sequencing of this but um I would certainly be a lot more coming I think this is a good project I think it's some you know it's got a huge merit and the use of it has got huge merits but um yeah the the resource consenting first and the um landlord's permissions or the least position permissions um second um really do nature of some of the concerns that have been um raised particularly the um the increased footprint the appearance of the building and some of the matters that have been raised in submissions um in principle I'm comfortable with it but um yeah I would far rather see what the resource consent process um results in first so that we know the result of what we're going to be approving rather than approving these consents and then um relying on the resource consent application and process to to to give us an outcome that we're then comfortable with aaron yeah um I will support this today um I do take a note during the deputations that we are the guardians of hagley park we are also I will point out that I i don't think that anything that's ever built on hagley park is ever permanent everything that goes there is temporary and when you look at the history of hagley park there's been many structures on there um certainly probably the most startling one was in the 1906.07 uh exhibition it was like and stuff uh um and then there was a there was a maori park built next to lake victoria um I kind of wish that it stayed there's other bits that have come and gone one of the most colorful parts is that they um grew tobacco plants um to help fund the park at one point so they don't do that anymore it's a it's a colorful history um and uh and it will have a colorful future the park was drawn up in 1850 and cricket got its first lease in 1860 in the park so it's been there a long time um it will continue to be there for a long time and that park is for everyone and when I look at the cricket matches like the one recently when 18 000 people were in that little corner of hagley park and it was shown off to the world as we romped the australians in a game of 20 20 qriket I don't think the romp in the australians is the key to the point I'm trying to make particular day uh they were definitely by far second best but that aside um it is a it's a great celebration of sport and of the culture of christchurch and it will continue to be there will it be there forever possibly not it might move again it may not be in hagley park none of these buildings will be forever because that's the nature of anything you put on land but we are the guardians and for now we keep an eye on it um and I don't think this goes too far beyond probably the original intentions of the use of hagley park and I think that's the main thing we need to keep an eye on today sarah did thank you um I'm going to support this today but I'd like to acknowledge the need for the consent to happen before this lease is put into effect and that is what number five puts in place so there are protections for the consent being in place ahead of the lease being activated that's really clear in our resolutions today and sports group a large and well organized one but it is a sports group and it's enabling community sports participation in our city the costs of a consent are substantial and we hear this time after time and if we're not going to support this we should indicate it now because for a not-for-profit it's untenable to have to go through the enormous expense of a resource consent without the certainty that we as council will then approve the building that's consented it is untenable for a sports group who is a not-for-profit doing work to enable women's cricket to be turned down at this point and have to then suffer those expenses on international women's day I attended an event where the significant work by new zealand cricket to enable more gender equity within the organization and within the um the various levels of women playing was outlined by the director anna johnston it was impressive they have had an enormous culture change they are really focused on uh equity and equality within the game and this is one more step to do um to not approve the replacement of the building as the one with the one outlined in the attached plans does our communities a disservice it does women who play the game in the city a disservice and I really urge my colleagues to vote in favor today yes after listening to the stuff and also all those the other reputation because the paragraph two that's the consent issue you need to go to the consent in the process but your people five you know can combine with the pack of two if you know all those the kind of the attachment plan attachment b is obtained obtained those consent then we approve this one no any excuse no any the argue but now if we presume you know we replace the functioning of the kind of the you know consent in the hell no matter the hearing pain or independent commissioner but I think this probably is not appropriate so the paragraph two I cannot the support but in principle I support this one but people too we cannot replace the consenting policies this is my concept I just think that an organisation has come to us with a a a proposal the advice that we've received from staff essentially is that that yes you can go either which way in terms of which comes first but if you are to invest the considerable time and expense and resources into going through the resource consent process then you really do need to know that you've got the council behind you and that's why I think it is absolutely imperative that we support this recommendation today and that is um for a number of reasons but the um I think the most significant of which relates to the nature of the facility that is there at the moment its various uses uh referred to the horticultural hall I think it was for a while it's back to a transitional name this would approve the naming of the new facility as the richard hadley sports centre sir richard hadley sports centre won't exist unless it meets the criteria for the international standard that they're setting uh for our city and if we want an place and it is appropriate in this place the decision was made some time ago in relation to the land lease that sits with this the decision was made as to the location of the of the oval working within the concept of what is able to be um uh you know facilitated in this space uh I i just think that we really do owe a an obligation to give the uh cricket for fraternity and the community groups that will rely on this facility to give them the certainty that they need to proceed I've timed myself out what um I was still seeking some advice so um I just uh 12 46. um so I'll just take a five minute adjournment just while we quickly get some advice on on how to put the vote um unless you'd like to wrap up the debates sam probably only to say I would have spoken a lot longer if the at the beginning if I'd known people would be opposed to it yeah it's outrageous I i if we weren't to approve city that we block progress and I just can't_''_2501.44 for the life of me work out when we have pragmatic solutions from the staff uh that we wouldn't proceed so I'm appalled we even need to get advice everyone should be supporting this and it's outrageous that they're not I'll take a five minute adjournment and we'll take the advice and then we'll come back
Thank you yeah openly kalkia thank you I have an apology from tim scandra for absence um that's the only one I have is I've got to know the catherine's on zuma's c online no okay should I turn up I'll have to move that pull one second all those in favor no declarations of interest confirmation of the previous million minutes do I have someone to move that sarah sam second all those in favor all right karen uh public forum first up we have uh david duffy's going to speak to propose new uh richmond cycle safety routes welcome david I just so you're aware you have five minutes and that will include any questions is there a magic toy here like the mouse the mouse oh right okay thanks for the opportunity to come and speak about our cycle safety route proposal this has come about as we have ongoing concern about the safety of children and other road users in richmond and um brought about by a careful watching of the current cycle lanes that are marked on the and there are a number of hazards presenting themselves which led us to look for a safer option we also are aware of community well we've got community support through a number of questionnaires we've presented at local events and we're also aware too of the worldwide trend towards city improving city infrastructures which provide greater access for cyclists scooter riders and pedestrians the proposal the rationale behind it is based on the the changing transportation systems the changing transport options this route proposes to use quiet suburban streets which have no competing elements like large service trucks buses etc large streams of commuter traffic and cars and that kind of thing and we also want to align the program with the current north richmond road repair program so that when the streets which have not been repaired yet are designed for repair they can take into account the inclusion of this road safety this cycle safety element in them the route itself as you can see starts over at the palms or the shirley intermediate school corner and wins its way through along north parade where street where it will serve the new banks avenue school which they turned the sod in the new site about two weeks ago and they're looking to be in residence in there around about mid late 2022 possibly 2023 so there'll be a an increased cycle flow for the younger generation through that area uh down to stableton's road winds its way around through dudley street nicholls street which are two streets due for a road repair program work in the new year through onto the streets that have been repaired including perth and alexandra and comes emerges out by fitzgerald ave the safety features considerations I've mentioned before the commute of rush hour traffic the narrow channels the heavy traffic the inherent traffic changes such as opening car doors buses pulling and out of traffic etc and we're suggesting that by re-routing those cycle options and the utilization of appropriate signage and road markings the danger factor will be significantly reduced we've gone carefully over the proposed route to see what modifications might be necessary and we've listed them there upgrading of of traffic lights in north parade to be retained the entrance to the school bank's avenue school may need to incorporate some design features to increase the safety of the school pupils the design of average street may involve narrowing of the current carriageway the pedestrian safing safety crossing safety zone on north aven road at nickel street may need to be redesigned that could be included in the nichols street repair program and just give cyclists the safe passage across fitzgerald avenue at alexandra street that maybe need to install some kind of crossing facility but then overall we would like to see prominent signage installed and and I and this is in line too or alongside a proposal from our association that the speed limit in the quieter roads of richmond be reduced to 40 kilometers an hour in terms of a time frame we'd like to see it worked in with the current road rebuild program some of which has already been completed and so we're probably looking at a two to three year fully completion of this scheme you thank you just um the map up um just that little bit is that going down north parade or is it going inside the school fence no it's going down north parade on the current um there's a quite a wide footpath from the martians road corner through to the old entrance to shirley boys high right and that's off off road it's pretty wide all the way down it's wide enough to accommodate cyclists it would be wider than twice this disc yeah but it might be a good idea to look at seeing if you could put it on the inside of the fence along the schools because it's surely intermediate doesn't go right up to the fence they don't they're not using it but the trees do I don't know design it in the committee thank you thank you very much it's great to have this type of deputation and obviously we're going to be going into the consultation for the long term plan um so it'll be really important to submit um also within that we uh our cycling infrastructure which we'll look at local connections as as well um so we do have a um a resolution up up there that I'll put in after all the public forums have been done just to make sure that we sort of look at some of these local connections that are being mentioned and actually how we're going to move then going forward but thank you for your time there's another one coming up soon sir um I have a second uh public forum from june pecker welcome june thank you I've come to talk about housing um and I'm hopeful that my neighbors and I can convince our council that what we're asking for is important and attainable given that it appears medium density housing is inevitable to some degree in our older suburbs I suggest we give up complaining and instead look at ways to make it more palatable than the two current examples at 138 and 47 mersey street in respect of these two developments it's obvious that what this developer is selling is acceptable to the nearby are affected and we're mostly of the opposing view so I request that our council work with us towards a less polarizing and more aesthetically pleasing future on a walk around saint albans in miraval recently my partner and I studied and took photos of a number of medium density blocks we imagined next door to our 100 year old bungalow and we rated them one pleasant two easy on the eye three acceptable four unattractive and five brutalists I took notes and we further discussed and analyzed at home and we were surprised to find that there's not much between one and five that can't_''_1380.32 be put right with changes to architectural features and some attention to the colour spectrum and a genuine concern for the amenity of the neighborhood that would include vegetation and we truly believe that it might be that easy wolfbrook designs in particular are almost all two-storied they're predominantly glaringly white with black window surrounds and rooves and sometimes dark stained usually upright wood panels this style originated in tutor times in england it's quite foreign to our attention in much the same way a stark wedding cake a big white thing in the middle of the table dominates that table there were only a few of these on our walk and they certainly did that they appeared incongruent in the extreme although our neighbouring our neighborhood housing comprises mainly single-story dwellings and our idea would be for new builds to follow suit it became obvious that large in itself is not the main problem we saw many very large houses in fact some of them from the 19th century even for instance nurse moored in the fitzroy and the salisbury foundation even these we could deem easy on the eye because of their presentation in fact 70 percent fell within our first three categories because of their colour palette alone sympathetic creams and ivories with roofs and trims from the same spectrum of the colour wheel these are in fact known as heritage colours suitable for older neighborhoods when accompanied by mature trees and lower paling fences as opposed to white concrete block walls and or those tall black slatted palisades this increased the visual amenities significantly impact of large two in an area of older and smaller we also noticed the predominant use of light green and or pale grey aluminium window framing that was eminently suited to our older leaving leafy neighborhood too the question most asked here and overseas currently in relation to the worldwide housing crisis is why do new builds have to look so ugly well they don't in our opinion our local knowledge is that these developers have paid around 500 000 each for the sections and they will sell the 11 units for more than 600 000 each that's what they're advertised for so we find it hard to believe they would go to the wall if they were authoritatively required to claddin or significantly use horizontal weatherboard or linear or brick paneling on the street facing aspects in our older suburbs and if they were required to paint in colours sympathetic to the age and colouring of the existing housing in the area if they were required to add features such as profiled windows trimmed in almost anything but black if they were required to design ameliorate impact on neighbours do you have much left to know nearly finished and finally we would ask that the council requires developers to maintain the properties they buy between purchase date and demolition of starter building this could be as simple as mowing lawns and collecting mail the house next to us previously always paying all always well maintained has attracted much attention in the past six months because of its unkempt appearance it's been entered illegally more than once left insecure a secure hazard exposed its owners haven't responded to polite requests to deal with this a similar property on been flooded ventilated I'm gonna have to do sorry I'm gonna have to stop you there because you're well over the five minutes okay but thank you for your time um and we appreciate you coming to speak on behalf of a number of saint auburn's residents who are concerned with this type of infill um obviously that is shared by a lot of people also around this council table um and I guess it's potentially not going to get any will encourage this type of activity and a lot of the communities that do have character areas aren't protected unless they're actually identified already within the district plan so it's not a it's not going to be an easy way to try and preserve some of that character as we move forward but we have done things in the past uh no in november last year we had a report to look at the quality of our medium and high density dwellings and also I guess when staff when the developers go through the resource consent process staff do work with them to try and suggest ways that they can actually keep to the character of communities but ultimately it is with the developers for that end product but we are very aware of your concerns and we're trying to do our best to see how we can I guess mitigate some of the impacts of these developments into these communities but thank you for your time thank you anything else um also I'd just like to note that um francine bills was wanting presented to the community board but I'll circulate after the meeting the letter that she'd put forward just so um other councillors are aware of what she wanted to say our last public forum I'm not too sure if he's here it's from chris baxter no he's not he's not here to present it um there is a powerpoint on on the hub if you want to have a have a look at it um so I've just got a resolution up there um can we just put in some correct word in there provide a presentation provided from david duffy on the proposed new richmond cycle safety routes thank you to this committee well we can provide information but I think we obviously had a very similar public forum that was going to be presented on another community and and I think this raises um the fact that actually we have um a number uh quite a bit of funding in the proposed long-term plan for I guess local connections and I think it's really important we actually look at maybe we need to actually um tie that into a wider some wider information to present back to the committee on I guess the second stage of the cycleway program that will actually allow cycleway connections to be connected and and also for any gaps in the networks to be filled up do you want that noted or included okay and the presentation to the richmond cycle exactly about yeah about yeah I guess the um local communities to major cycleways full stop delivery I just had a question so what's the question I'm so just wondering when we can share the avon otakuro mcr kind of root considerations I mean for those of us who have seen it it seems like we're just talking about the scientists I just okay answered you and it just further to to to that um note um and and maybe how communities raise a need for you know their concern or how do we go through the process of actually a community bringing uh their attent the attention of the committee to the fact that they need a connecting part yeah yeah look we'll take it off take that offline take it off okay so that's different this is just included so we'll take that off offline consideration yeah aaron did you want to say something before we well it's just around the same thing that I think a particular community has done an incredible amount of work to bring effect but well what they believe is a fact-based presentation to the council that if we were an enabling council we would go why can we not do that and we should on every single cycle way we do we should be weighing up in some areas do we get a better bang for buck by putting this in because you'll get this many people on bikes versus another area where you won't might not get many but we need to when this comes back it should be why can't it be done not it goes into an eventual long-term plan after all the cycleways are finished I totally agree and it's actually a very good presentation and that's why we place to ensure it does not get lost but anyhow I'm happy to move that it's drivers to move this and we're going to get a second that will uh jake and I'll take it offline and we'll get something to actually cover all the secondary routes and gaps at a later date okay all right jake's three seconds all those in favor any opposed carried then we did the whole time they covered the whole lot of the public forums excellent thank you all right we're going to move to items um item seven the buy monthly transport report mr chair I'll take the reporters read there's nothing in particular I need to bring to the committee's attention this time around but I do have all the relevant transport managers here mark pinner who's the maintenance manager stephen thomas operations and lynette who does capital delivery and ltp excellent we'll go straight into questions yeah questions oh thanks several actually um so the I'm just concerned about the ballads the high cost of the bollards and in in that process um so obviously in here it just says that they're going in so there's no opportunity for us to consider the costs associated with what's proposed the costs were approved as part of the annual plan and we're delivering on the annual plan so for like smaller things we would get a report that secures the options here's the costs but we haven't had that for the bollards and I don't quite understand briefings on the bollards but every transport proposal was slightly different and that some of them require community board decisions some of them require committee decisions some of them require decisions of council this one was decided by council via the annual plan and we've had two briefings on it and that um opinion of the council when we briefed you last was to certainly continue with delivery of the bollards and that's what we've done well it was because we took a straw poll and it was it was clear through the briefings we had that there was guidance to go down annual plan process it's just a one-line item where their budget was increasing right it's the question's been answered so just I just want to check on the cycleways so the um the pawaho river road the it's great that you've said that there's some funding available now to coordinate with the land jonas program how's the best way to access that funding for um particularly the kiwi rail opawa um bridge because that's an area where we've got land drainage we've we've got an opportunity to just think about um some of the the synergy between works that's currently happening there's also I mean there's quite a strong community desire for that opala road richardson terrace area village area to be enhanced through the craft funding so it would just seem sensible to try and get some preliminary design work in that location so we have brought enough funding forward to an undertake preliminary design work not construction work so there is money to do design work to ensure that we are aligned and it appropriate community boards they've been briefed if they've been asked so that's been happened the response I got back was the cycleway is not going to be constructed to 2025. it isn't and no decisions have been made and secrets we can't_''_2405.04 do any construction until we've headed this I'm not talking about the construction I'm just talking about the design so it's incorporated into we are starting the design and figuring out the route but it is a it's five or six kilometers of road so we're trying to understand what the land drainage team and the impact that the land drainage team has on the banks of the river and how that impacts what we can or can't_''_2427.76 do as part of the cycleway but that's the level at which it is it's not down to a specific point under a specific bridge so the bridge you've mentioned as as you're aware a kiwi rail bridge that is being replaced um so they are replacing the infrastructure across the river that is understand the desire to coordinate but we don't have money to do any construction works or coordination down there until 2028 and it might not be where the route goes because it's not fully determined yes um this the third question sorry the third question you raised was about craft the craft prioritization conversations will be coming back to each of the boards as we've talked about in all of the processes so the team will be coming back to the board in the next few months just there he's got expressway route 2 this is on page 15. it says the final consent for the work has been lodged contract documents are being prepared I know that there was also an engagement consultation on the proposal to change the road it still has to come back to the committee so if the road proposal doesn't go through does that impact on the consent yes potentially so would we not be better to resolve that issue first before we launch the consent only if we're going to ask you to resolve an issue sorry but it does have to come back okay I don't know how others feel but I'm a little bit concerned do you know from that engagement what the feedback has been today it's not as to not change the the clear feedback has been to not change the um use of that stream yeah that that's what worries me when are we going to get that we will get it we'll get a report back on that but there's been clearly when are we expecting the report back to the committee on have to cheat with the team but it should be in the next couple of months okay thank you could you stop going before I need it before committing this yeah yeah that's please I guess that yeah do you understand the issue though is that we've lodged the consent and in the meantime the consent will be processed may we just see that may have an impact well I don't I don't know what the hell they've lodged the consent so okay yeah I've just sure feedback oh okay cool just two other questions one is um I've I've sent round through the the future streets report that that was done and uh you know there's been a lot of stuff happen since it was complete but it's a really good report and I was just interested to get a staff response memo some some advice back on how we could actually incorporate the findings of that report into our work programs and I'm not quite sure the best way to do that so I just thought I'd so I don't know future streets was not our report as a transport report and it's not even a council report it was actually funded by nzta and it was a study that was undertaken um with hayata college and the campus there and a number of other community groups a fully agreed counsellor it is a great uh that is and that has been um feedback to the community board I believe it's the community board needs to bring it back to council to feed it into thing is what you're saying is get community awards to come to council asking for action on it it needs to come back as a community board priority it's not it's not our report we we provided information to support the report but it's not ours okay no that's cool I think and um phil and james sort of heard that so I think you guys could sort of take a bit of a lead there to get that report in front of us yeah well I mean I also could report some of that area too so I'll work with you guys and we'll get something um and just finally the real-time information system seems to be not working um I'm really concerned that we've now got a new system but we've had no briefing on it as best I can tell so I did put this question ahead can you just give me some sense of um what's happening with our current real-time information uh is it working is it functional uh and do we have any cost of repair until we get the new system in and then the new system that's proposed what is it and how can we have assurances that that money has been well spent and not just on another system that's going to cause issues going forward like we've seen with the previous one so for those who are not familiar with it the public transport real-time information system is jointly managed but by ecan and christchurch council and what it does is provide that sort of information to the bus traveler you're correct it is uh it is at the end of its life and is at risk of significant failure so um but what we've also found is that a number of those systems are no longer used because people have apps on their phone and it's just not simply necessary for us to replace all of those rti systems across the entire network so what we've done and we have put this in numerous um I think we've updated the committee quite regularly on this process but we've entered international experience and delivery of these sorts of systems and we will replace about 100 of them there's about 350 at the moment we'll replace about 100 of them at the key locations and then there's a number of other ones which can be recalibrated I think there's about 60 or 80 70 can be recalibrated under the new network so you'll end up with less but they will work better and they will be placed in locations where the need is the most so far better system more up to date but you're correct the existing one is passed it's used by date and needs to be replaced no no screens and then there's the old ones now it's it's it's past past end of life and this need to be replaced and it was one of the things that got um indicated as part of the pt futures uh work as well so it was a recommendation that that be uh replaced but that was already intro so I guess that leads the question um if it tell people rather than people get incorrect time of when buses are coming um it will be replaced imminently and I think the best thing to do is we are still managing the system as it currently stands it's not perfect but I i would I wouldn't recommend getting rid of the whole system because it needs to both speak to the system on the bus but also the system at the bus interchange as well so there's three components to it what sits at the bus stop what works on the bus and what sits at the bus interchange so I wouldn't recommend turning it off um but what we do need to do is get on with replacing it with the new system as soon as possible and we're doing that so when will we see the new system um he's not to put an exact date on it but but we're certainly looking at um q2 q3 this year so this calendar year so I'm I'm hopeful it'll be done by you know the end of q3 but it's just really frustrating for people when they go to catch the bus they push the button total bus is coming in 20 minutes and it's a 10 minute frequency down the road or they go on the website and they get wrong information I think it's doing huge damage to two people catching the buses and you know another six months of that spoken to your points um thank you I've got two quick questions um 3.8 was the lowest stixx martian bridge work um and that's on page 18. um so I see there that the land drainage recovery project to naturalize the box drain is currently on hold and that that would be concerning the lamp the lamprey there no it's a different section of the drain they can't change that section where the lamprey are because they actually nest in the box so is it to the north or I think so yes and so why is that on hold is that budgetary or I can't answer that I'm sorry but will that not hold the question is the gnarly old lagoona um gardens palm tree in um palms um well I've got you can I ask what's happening there uh there should have been memo which has gone out if it hasn't if you haven't received it already we're repairing it and um councillor major gave us a bit of advice which was very useful and that saved us saved us a bit of money um so we've taken that on board and and we'll replace it but I think my recollection of the discussion um last time around there was a specific issue around laguna and but the wider issue was around uh developers doing greenfield type subdivisions building roads and putting in place these sorts of things which we in here and they cause cost council so I know my question is about the repair job on that one because they're my constituents who are hounding me about it I haven't seen the memo have I missed it has it gone out it's coming it's coming it's coming okay will there no just one option and it will be repaired okay I think you'll look forward to the memo yep cheers sarah thank you um just looking back uh a couple of minutes too a couple of things that yani mentioned the kamla terrace roading change heathcote expressway I understand heathcote expressway is shovel-ready and time-sensitive for a range of reasons not just shovel-ready but lizards and bits and pieces um so having their report through would be great how to involve the community board getting the community board briefed and whether they're there's a briefing at the same time as council as I don't know but it will figure it out that would be really good um and the other one is the the kiwi rail bridge and while we can't do anything because there's currently no funding sitting until 2025 or later for that particular cycle way if the design work was but the work land drainage and the design work was advanced enough earlier in that council could make a decision to to shift some funding so I don't want the to hold up sort of plans to do something so that section of road floods frequently it's a high use pedestrian area for kids getting to school that kind of thing and it would be good to have it sorted I understand that but we do also have to have the route yeah yeah yeah so once we start spending money on it not saying do it now but if that design once that design work gets done in the work with land drainage then um it could come to you know annual plan next year you know that we can make a small change there to get a section done um but it is a it's a really horrid area for people to pass through at high tide so yeah thanks so just a quick one on 3.3 the craft um so it looks like it's all progressing well when we get that in the future this one's got the list will there be timelines on when that works going to be completed in terms of yeah yeah well that's part of the prioritization so that prioritization on that prioritization stuff are we going to prioritize the work that doesn't need to be consulted on an effort to get stuff moving quicker well that's nuts and bolts of the business case yeah we will be coming back as long as indicated we will be coming to back to the boards um who have craft funding over the next month or so maybe two with a few e2 doing some of the easy wins this financial year so that's always been our intention the business case spoke to having the money spent by mid 2023 and that's certainly our intention to you know comply with what the business case said um and I think that will be a discussion with the boards as to you know what they see as priorities and what they want done first I mean there is some stuff in there which may require and I'm thinking you know when you start removing car parks and other things for renewals around streets there might be specific consultation which is required for some projects other ones none and we've got the contractors in place to do it okay so do you have a sense of what that might look like in terms of split whether there's half that's going to be non-consulted and just got on with we will be able to bring that back to you and we can prioritize it around that and give you an indication of what stuff we think can just be done without further approvals or consultation and up what staff would might need to go through a separate process yeah cool thank you jimmy one question on page 20 under paragraph 4.1 because this is annual plan that we increased 4.5 million dollars pretty good you know and start particularly emphasize three point or original maintenance rule yes but I'm concerned is because some similar law you know even receive but after the show period time then damage again poho earthquake so in here principle is very good in the particular star emphasize like to engage with the contractor ensure scorpion agreement work aligned with cancer expectation but I suggest the start should be the review to receive all done but summer world because due to the traffic flow or heavy motor vehicle passes this one very very crucial important I would like to you know suggest each one need to review more more clearly detail yes otherwise just waste the money waste the time thank you council thank you aaron cole I've got a few um first one because it come up at the disability meeting on monday was the disability car parks by the town hall on colombo street that were going to be you know if you come just past killwall coming from the north they were on the left there's about three they're still not in place yet or marked just is that waiting for the other columbus street consultation so I thought they were just so north of I'm sorry that'll be south of kelmore yep that's the bit that we have to finish so there are still construction works to be done there right and their construction works haven't_''_3352.0 been linked oh yeah so that's all part time it hasn't been then month after to council so after that so it's probably six months away to be here okay this year um now yeah it's about this year yeah the uh other one is um the bus trial from uh when they did the um northern corridor the uh um the the free bus and stuff have we had numbers on the success or lack of for that I haven't had numbers I've only had discussions with environment canterbury and it sounds like it's been popular but um I haven't got any numbers yet but we will get them right I would have thought that we have those but um that's all right uh but so they'll come at some point it'll show us what that well it's still pretty early days um given that particles over january which school holidays and traffic flows are different we don't like to do monitoring over that period but um they would have them uh but I think that there are pains to kind of make sure they've got a reasonable uh start reporting them yeah richard can we also make sure that when we get the numbers on patrons we also look at the travel time savings that have been made on that route because of the express bus route compared to what it used to be so we can have a good look at everything yeah because I've I've seen a couple at peak time buses coming down there and to say they were empty with their compliment so they had like five and six people on each bus which was a concern I thought they were going to be quite full um so and then uh the hereford street um lights that are over by the bridge there so that changing were they never planned or designed when the promenade was done because they're moving the control box and have cut a big track through all that really nice tile that was put down two years ago or maybe three years ago um that nice I don't know what it is slate or something which looks really expensive to replace quite a lot of it patch through it now but I'm sure that won't be the final the light controllers there probably yes the intersection's been done as part of the the hereford street upgrade yeah and we do have those slate tiles we are working with odacaro to get those so we have arranged them in stock so if things do need to be replaced we can go on given that that's now our asset we can go in and replace them so that that would be done as part of the hereford street upgrade right yes they are that's correct so the traffic signal boxes uh all around christchurch as you remember the council's put more money into the annual plan long-term plan for replacement of those because some of those assets are pretty old sorry excuse me yeah because it just it would appear that the um the design one you wouldn't have done that part and then changed it within a couple years so was that not no it wasn't done as part of the promenade that was the bit that was left the promenade went up to either side and we've had to drop the intersection as part of the bridge in the europa street upgrade so that was left out and there was a report to council about that from attacker to us our responsibility bridge super sings us as we're doing that on behalf of otaku as well oh yeah oh yeah okay and then um the madras uh litchfield street lights I thought um in a meeting a couple of weeks ago um because the mayor had uh raised it about turning them off and then also probably casual as well oh barbados because this is where it's been stopped that's been fixed which one so um we did pick up on that it was a briefing yesterday about the multi-use arena yeah and um essentially you are darling thanks hey hey paper car phil so those signals have been um fixed uh on an interim basis because obviously there's further work that will need to be done once the design of the stadium is further progressed right and you know they'll be's pretty detailed on that uh presentation we gave to um council yesterday so I can recirculate that if yeah so what's fixed so because they're all still there and still on so what does it mean it's still there and so on but um I think the issue stefan do you want to speak to it that's more your cup so I think the concern was that they were impeding the flow of traffic and they weren't necessary so what the team's done is to make sure they've taken away the permanent demand for the side street um so that's now comes on um triggered over here yeah so but but in reality the um madras street is on a platoon anyway so as you move down the dress street it goes on the green wave so that only would the the lights are there in the section I've only held you I was like oh sorry I'll sit back down again sorry um is that better um yeah and so um it was I think so so it some people were just going around the block so they'd go left in and then yeah yeah so they're the ones that would have been hell for it so what they're now is effectively on permanent green and unless someone comes from a side street to to call that that movement and then they'll go to read and let the person out of the side street also uh pedestrians also can can call them as well so right yeah okay yeah because unbelievably someone was watching the meeting and then contacting me said oh the mayor said this but they're still there yeah yeah so we haven't switched them off per se because obviously pedestrians still want to be able to get across the street so yeah okay that makes sense they did actually was their words they said the mayor said that they were mean it was there and it's been done yeah okay I'll tell them it's been done but it's not how they thought but it is exactly her and I'll tell him to rewatch this the mirror's extremely powerful carefully um the cycle way along the um northern railway line how's that progressing because I get the odd question by people that it's really well yeah because that one's popular along the railway line and there's a there's a really popular gate track along railway line there isn't there yes yes um it is actually progressing well we are looking to um we're just about to award contracts for some of the bits that aren't on kiwi rail land which is getting started so through barnes reserve so some of the bits that are offered in the section from styx mill overbridge up to northward so widening that path so they can use the shared path up to northwood so that's going to get going um but we are also managing to progress very well with our designs at that point it goes up main north road and then does it go cut back by the super center it actually stops at the supercenter right so it doesn't go through the new subdivision right's when it'll start needing to connect into the local network right as that gets built and the bit on the rail corridor that's you know that's progressing well as well we we just about at 100 designs with qra and they've agreed to design so we are progressing and we've got an agreement for at least but we've got to have the designs agreed to get the lease agreed so it's a bit of chicken and egg but we are and then an egg oh that's which one goes first but which is that likely to be this year we'll be starting the designs uh we'll be starting the um construction on the non-kiwi rail bits this year we are aiming to get construction started on kiwi roll land this year yes right right because I'm just going to put my hand in my heart and guarantee it well it just if the pressure needs to be on kiwi rail just the council um right to or get our mps to hustle up so as we mentioned week um councillor turner did have a conversation with minister robertson and uh that he's realized realised benefit and that that we are working together and much more aligned right and and look here as an organization the priorities are a lot more focused in auckland to be fair there's a lot more going on up there um but it did help refocus priorities down here and we are seeing progress so that's good okay cool thank you and it's a shovel ready project as well and minister robertson's the infrastructure minister as well so okay okay james 3.10 the downstream effects I just want to understand the bullet first bullet point see where it says traffic counts currently indicate volumes have not reached pre-sea and northern corridor opening volumes is that a good thing or a bad thing I'm not sure what are you expecting the volumes to be greater than the opening volumes or they should be less than 3.1 I have the first bullet point um traffic counts indicate volumes have not reached pre-cnc so look the the main concern with at the cranfirdness intersection and there'd be a lot of dispersed traffic running down local routes and and the scheme of the plan was really to seek to dissuade people from doing that and keep them on cranford street so it appears that that is working from the information that we have there's certainly some streets which are experiencing an increase in traffic flows and we're continuing to monitor that um and as you'll see you know we've we've put in some temporary measures down there around francis ave and um etc 10 street so yes you would have expected it to potentially be more but that was the whole issue that we needed to monitor as part of the downstream fix management sorry you're talking about the rat running rather than the cranford street is that right those that's right okay I thought you were talking about cranford street itself right you've just clarified it for me thanks phil guys um just touching on the follow-ups with what yanni said why why do we have to get people in from have we got to get installers from overseas yeah that's um can we I i know people that can dig holes actually yeah when we when we did the briefing at the end of last year we we showed you the um does it need special that yeah really okay has this vehicle mitigation okay um dyes pass road how are we sort of looking there just giving we update on how things are going can we not put an update on this better make sure we put an update in this next time on that one that's a big big job sorry um it's progressing well um they're really starting they've I believe they've just about finished the inside works and they're about to start on the right on the outside they say the wall works next week I'm looking to get up there with cook and do some then looking to do some videos so that people can see what's going on up there right inside the closed site the traffic management seems to be improving we have had a few weird issues on the outside that could be with the stability of the ground on the outside of you no problem um and my old favorite here the old coastal pathway um what put that we've got the plans here now what just you might have told me once before what percentage of the path is cantilevered I'm just trying to get in my head how is it so expensive is 50 10 just a bit on the corner right up by that they're trying to only put as much cantilever and as we absolutely need yeah it is the section between the christchurch yacht club yes and shag rock that has the potential to be cantilevered but not all of it is and I can't_''_4153.199 put a percentage on it I'm sorry yeah no but as far as the percentage of the rate it'll be a minor percentage a little bit and and the the nice stone rock wall around there I can't quite sit on it that's definitely staying there don't know that the solid wall yeah okay and um that's about it's not a it's not a heritage wall by the way sorry it's not a heritage item all right so it it could well be coming out that wall I'll have debate stuff later excellent good to know and thank you thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions and clarify things a couple of things just wondering about the variable speeds along a road why they change you know 40 50 60 um along one stretch of road um quite uh stefan to speak to that one if that's okay in general or specifically well um this one that we're looking at monk spur there are changing speeds along there but there's also other roads throughout christchurch for example hallsville junction road it's a lot of different speeds along the air and just wondering understanding what's behind it yeah so so we we set um speed limits to the speedometer's rule and also the speed management guide so it's basically speed limits are based on on the risk um and um which gives an indication based on the risk of the road what the speed limit should be we then um we then use that to and in conjunction with the speed management guide to see the speed limit um that that can result in as as a road goes through different environments the speed limit can change um and one of the things that nzta were trying to achieve under the last um sort of major change to speed limits was to get less speed limits and be more consistent across the country so there's real emphasis on um 60s and 80s rather than 70s and 90s for example and um and so much so that under the under the guide and the rule you have to get special dispensation from nzta to use those alternative speed limits so that's to try and reduce some of the confusion and the differential speed limits um where I guess it probably impacts christchurch the most is as the speed limits that come in underneath below 50 and you've got your 30s and 40s which is um and as a 30s are in your your high um your sort of areas of where the place function high place function as well as a high number of concentration of active users as well so that's where you get your sort of town centres or your little key activity areas which may be 30. then the difference with that is obviously with the variable speed limits we have outside schools which are currently have to be 40. um although there is some work being done at a national level to try and change those 30s but I haven't had an update on that for a while so I'm not sure whether it's got to it's kind of quiet but does that sort of answer your question yep that's really great and as an area changes are they reviewed or what's the process what happens does it come through a community board that there's a need for a change or what happens there yeah it can come through any anyway come from a member of the public it comes through the community board my staff've done a number of speed um management changes across sort of the key residential areas and we with those ones in particular we tried to based on the advice we got from the council councillors um a few years back we try to do it with where the residents want it um so where they they raise it so we've got um might ignite stream and there's some areas uh there's been areas where that was requested by the by the um by the public and we've sort of followed that so yeah so it could come from a number of sources but we also the the mega maps that um that comes from zta highlights the the um the real high risk uh roads as well from a safety point of view and we've got a requirement to review those um on a regular basis thank you really helpful excellent all right someone want to move this report jimmy seconder pauline phil did just talking about uh aaron and um the bus lanes and people not but using the buses have we written were proposing free buses for two years why do they love putting up people's rights so I i I thoroughly support this I think this is great because we spend an absolute fortune on bus lanes and to see people going past past us on in buses with not many in it I think we if we if we want to put our on the line we should um jump in with this and um try it out because if we don't try it we'll never know and I i think we should throw some money at ecan and give them a hand to do it right of course they can we can afford it we'll get it from somewhere else and so I just I'd like to just say that we should we should encourage people to change the way they think and get on buses if we're if we're serious about thinking about it and use the bus lanes that we're spending so much money for and from what I'm told and sarah might be able to tell me of cars into buses it makes one hell of a difference does it just five percent so it's debate it is debate okay that's a good debate um the and the other thing I i can't understand at on this um on the cycle on the coastal pathway why we spent a whole lot of money on ashfield ash felting that road when we know that we're going to now dig out perhaps that rock wall and the curb and things it seems we're not going to win any friends on that bit just saying thank you jimmy uh I would like to tell this opportunity particularly acknowledge the staff you know particularly in uh where the homebay area concerned also traffic issue by yesterday very very good staff have a five kind of stuff you know wiring the specialist to have a presentation in our community but also we invited some kid community the leaders representative attend and also solar q and a they are all very satisfaction I think that's very good model you know we can continue working together you know school company at the primary school the staff to help them you know to have established a school travel plan and also to undertaking the park smart program at least you know build up a very good foundation give those students and teaching staff are confident so just want to acknowledge the stuff regarding to this one yeah uh I want to thank staff for the report um I have to say I'm very concerned that we haven't been briefed on the real-time information if you think about public transport and phil's touched on the free fares which is something that I've also supported in the past we need to improve what we're doing around public transport and one of the best things we could do is get integrated ticketing with a common technology across the country I mean it's quite silly at the moment that every council has their own system their own consultants spends a fortune on technologies that become obsolete so in terms of real-time information it would be fantastic to actually look at what other councils are doing and work we get synergy and savings it's been really disappointing to see that the current system is is broken um when we've invested so much for so long and I do know like greater wellington um council they've had really good reporting on real-time information but nothing else so so you know I just think that we we really should understand what's happening in that in that space because I think the point that staff made which is correct is it's all tied into the screens at the bus exchange the buses themselves and then what's actually on the on the corner on the on the footpath or on the bus stops in the communities so yeah I personally think we should be getting more information and then just to say that you know I think doing the route selection for our cycleways and being transparent around that is really critical we've heard from a community today who are putting forward suggestions uh but we're not able to share what we're considering in terms of route selection if we could work together area if we could work together around even the route selection and design process we'd be much better placed I think than rather rather than duplicating a whole bunch of efforts or people not knowing what's proposed and proposing other things ah there's just too much I want to answer um so I'll take some of that offline the one thing so I said I just said so I'll take some most of it offline what I will do though is just talk to the one brief point about the asphalt down main road which was done as part of the repairs for the road to the port so a huge amount of work happened there and was done well ahead of any shovel ready before covert and before shovel really funding at a time when the city council had the funding for the coastal pathway out in 2027 and 2028 and so the coastal pathway work wasn't planned to be done for another 10 years which is why the road got done thank you aaron yeah I think the original major cycleways routes I can see where the confusion lies therefore and I just want to second phil's proposed motion around helping fund the buses I think it makes sense the only thing is that that should come from the money we're going to spend on the infrastructure and on the bus lanes don't put in those 23 kilometers of bus lanes until we know that more than 2.2 of the population want to actually catch the bus then you find that out by doing the trial but certainly not for the two years they're proposing a lot shorter we'll soon find out whether anyone actually wants to catch the bus and I'm willing to run a book on or with all proceeds going to charity does anyone else want to contribute to this excellent debate on receiving in a report yeah why not okay the the only thing I was going to say is I can't remember the numbers because I haven't looked it up but I had read that when the buses were free coming from wymac into the city there were less pay thank you all those in favor anyone opposed karen um that would be counselor chien could you please close the media for karakia okay thank you you
Um and actually the amendments to delegations paper which is item number 22 um seems to me to be a relatively uh straightforward paper I mean I'll go back to the other other ones but would someone like to move the delegation's paper andrew seconded by jake I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried so that's those two items off the agenda so now we'll go back to the part a report of the community board reports which
Very much time uh the suggestion is that we jump to 19 which is the hearings panel report to the council on the request to build changing rooms in north hagley park uh and I'd like to invite um the chair of the hearings panel sam mcdonald to present the report here sure it's pretty self-explanatory it's literally a variation to the lease so they can get on and do their work it went through a normal process hearings panel we had one group come in and submit there were a couple that were initially concerned uh that the staff were able to mitigate them no concerns around consultation or anything so yeah I mean I'm happy to move it I doubt there'll be any questions or anything it's relatively straightforward right do you have a second phil major are there any questions is there any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry it thank you andrew and thank you sam a good process thank you very much um
And the next one is christchurch coastal pathway amongst bay section another team for that one and we're just looking at the speed limits so I'm just um drawing your attention to some changes to the wording so rather than referring it to the chair and deputy chair of the urban development and transport committee actually does have to go to the um to the committee there isn't the ability to just transfer it to the chair and deputy chair so it's just a technical technical change um so does anyone want to move this one sarah seconded by oh come um are there any questions for staff just at the board we heard from a resident particularly concerned around safety um so I presume there's going to be some safety all that's done as part of that the detailed design yes that's correct after a completion of detail design we'll do a safety audit and we we have uh try to review that if that's the right turning into that main road property with the um remote yet okay and we're not putting the cycle way separated from the road like why are we putting one on the road as well so the there has been a philosophy along the whole of this route and it always has been that there is a very very strong commuter route commuter uh level of commuter cycling from sumner and there is a there are a number there as we all know even on the weekends there's a number of rides that go over and do the loop round over sumner road and through summer and background red cliffs or the other way so they want to use the road and will use the road and therefore there needs to be space on the road for them to use it so it has been a philosophy of this project for the whole time so there will be on-road cycle race on-road cycle lanes for the confidence cyclist in the cycle path where we don't want people going super fast they are combining with pedestrians less confident cyclists it's there's two options here okay and just um the final car crash the other week do we have any sense of what the cause of that was and whether this has any consideration into the design I'm not aware of it not aware of the crash sorry can't come on um phil thanks lynette is you're just saying about um commuter cycle lanes and mcrs is that every mcr has a just just this one or just this is not an mca coastal pathway if I can yeah this is a shared path um for mixed users there's obviously a lot of scenery a lot of lingering and dogs kids strawberries I can understand that yeah okay and I do know people that do the lot of cycles those shared pathways are not designed for people to travel at speed on um bicycles so and this is not a major cycleway route this is the coastal pathway it's a separate initiative all right oh any discussion I'll put them uh yani yeah I mean like the coastal pathway is is great you know I'm really supportive of the coastal pathway it was something from the city to the sea even before the earthquake and the earthquake um sort of enabled us to get the opportunity to do it I mean obviously there are some of us that hope that as part of the infrastructure repairs things would be done at the same time so it would be quicker and possibly more cost effective it hasn't worked out that way but um you know this is pretty significant to get to this point today where we're agreeing being asked to agree to this section I think what's really important though is that we do we do have a process to understand any safety concerns that come out and to respond as a counselor who used to represent this area previously I i do know that um there has been a number of safety issues that have been raised historically so you know I look forward to this being put and put in place um and I definitely think it would be really good to ensure that there is a process to put forward any anything that comes out of those safety intersections further on uh in in places like um ferrymed bridge and that whole intersection design so but the key thing here is that there's a real strong desire for the coastal pathway it will be a real asset for the whole city uh and it helps um get that connection from the city to the sea which is a really positive thing thank you I'll put them uh sarah thanks um the coastal pathway is a community-led project and the community and the board backed the recommendation today and the other things let's remember that today all the council is being asked to make a decision on is the speed limit changes and not anything else to do with the proposal which has already been approved by the community board safety issues are key which is one of the reasons we're building the coastal pathway to give people a safe option um to get around that corridor and let's remember that the footpath that used to be there in many of this area is no longer able to be due to to rock fall putting up with a goat track on the other side of the road ever since and there have been accidents so this is a safety improvement the safety issue that was raised in the community board deputation just to be clear for people was a concern that a gentleman had coming out of his driveway where when he moved onto the footpath a lamp post or several lamp posts would be blocking his view this is a consideration and an issue for many people coming out of their driveways across the city and not isolated to this particular project although it was raised in this project and what he was asking for is the lamp posts to be moved and that will be taken into consideration during the process but it's not isolated to that one incident that one that one position so really looking forward to this going ahead great that the community backed the speed limit changes um and looking forward to getting some more sort of in the village area and stuff in the near future thanks I'll put the motion all those in favor you very much thank you
Item number 14 kashmir was the hunhay road intersection upgrade and we've got staff at the end of the table and anyone got any questions for staff mike davidson good morning good morning um just similar question to what I asked caroline about the feedback from the blind low vision new zealand on removing the pedestrian crossings why not not installing pedestrian crossings we haven't had specific feedback on that um the removal or the non-marking of the pedestrian crossings on the slip lanes has been taken out because of the safety issue that it creates for pedestrians yeah no I understand that but are we not potentially creating a um another safety issue for people with vision impairment by actually removing the pedestrian crossings as as well and therefore if safety of pedestrians was the prime reason wouldn't we look to actually just remove the slip blade and have it all signalized so um I've asked wayne gallup to come down and talk to that he's a safety engineer so he can talk to the technicalities around that the reality of this intersection is very difficult orientation we are generally around the city when we do our designs trying to not have slip planes this is a very difficult orientation that would make turning very difficult without slip lanes wayne will talk to the removal of or that having or not having pedestrian crossings my my understanding is by having a pedestrian crossing there you actually create a hazard for a blind or a visually impaired person is that correct correct I was involved in the at the outset of this project but the um the alignment and the in the the skewed alignment of the intersection is such that you have to have those left-hand slip lanes to get vehicles around those those tight left-hand bends um the pedestrian crossings were initially put in but through the safety audit process were taken out because of the lack of advanced visibility of the pedestrian crossings and and then pedestrians obviously stepping out thinking they had priority but the vehicle's not seeing them so so the raised tables are the safest solution with the current alarm with with the with the um appropriate uh stop and a check but we are I guess for most projects trying to avoid doing slip lanes thank you okay I'm just I'm worried about this to matthew sorry tim I was reluctant to do this paper with you out of the room and just another question question just another question yep when are we looking to start construction on when are we looking to start construction just I wouldn't start construction uh april tim do you want to move this uh yes thank you yeah melanie did you want to second it yeah is there any discussion I'll put them off tim well I just want to thank you so much for this this has been a bit of a ping pong moving from date to date and although we've had a connection into walls until we're small and which should never have happened until this was built it's a really good thing that this is happening as soon as it is and um I'm sure the community really appreciate it so thank you very much melanie I i think was concerned with first as well but um like the staff have explained I think um it's really important that pedestrians are looking um because cars will come around those corners quite quickly and suddenly come upon that pedestrian crossing so it is really on pedestrians to be really watching rather than stepping out which is why this is safer thank you mike thank you and I was pretty confident that your board specific caroline would have looked at some of the issues that may cause with pedestrians but um and I will support it because it's a much needed um intersection up upgrade for obviously have quite a popular destination now with the venture park but it does consume me when we have to keep going to slip lanes for a variety of of reasons because we seem to we need to have a slip lane you put in vulnerable people at risk whether they're walking or on on a bike going in front of the slip lane so I'm glad to hear that we're trying to avoid doing them wherever ever possible we I'll just be keeping an eye to make sure it doesn't keep happening thanks thank you I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye hi those opposed say no that's carried thank you and the next one is
Daniels to provide us with the karakia temutanga thank you uh kia ora and thank you very much uh we've got an apology from councillor kotter with someone like uh and a lateness for golf so if you'd like to move that would you and seconded by melanie I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried um and I'd like to move that the resolution to exclude the public said
Thank you thanks tori thank you and last but not least um the waitai coastal burwood community board cali baba save the best of the world with us this morning and also community governance manager an all-time favorite chris turner oh just think of those beside you and how they feel I apologize in advance for chris who forgot the um the blue shirt dress code uh for today I noticed that oh got their blue shirts on moving right along so community board decisions under delegation so we've had allocations of funding for some great groups as usual arunui community trust or actus as they're better known for the purchase of a public address sound system they're a really active really positive force in our community and probably the gold standard for community organizations in my opinion because of the skills they have and the range of services that they provide to the community they're so deeply ingrained in the community also darlington residents association for the printing of their quarterly newsletter to communicate with their members and community um so a walking group program's the recon sports events unit have put together um a walking group for 30 to 45 minutes based out of four local swimming pools um and once a month there's a special session after the walk for people to sort of try activities and get information so sort of hooking people in and then offering them more which I think is is really smart and the qe2 program commenced february 2nd and this information in your agenda look at that so we have a couple of great sort of festivals in our wards over the summer and one of them was the 11th iteration of I love brighton 2021 so it was emceed by local councillor james daniels who has some experience behind a microphone of course perfect weather again a big crowd and a great community event and people come from all over the city to go to this so thousands of people enjoyed this on the 7th of february at thompson park the planning group is who's who of local organizations and I just want to highlight them like the youth alive trust the new and then new brighton business association and council are involved as well so thank you to everyone involved we've got a short video which will show at the end of the presentation so our other big community event is parklands at play which occurred I think a week later another fantastic day and highlighting local clubs fencing karate dance rugby archery tag football basketball radio controlled cars gymnastics netball and table tennis so a whole spectrum of different sports and there was music throughout and the toy library were involved um uh stan some of you know stan tawa his son played a fantastic trumpet solo during the during some of the music absolutely stunning um and the a lot of this was coordinated by the pukeko center who uh uh like eastern community sports another great organization in our area partnering with groups so we fund this as part of the community board and I'd have to say it's one of the great things that we do as a community board and as a council I mean yes we're we're roads and footpaths and something tangible that the people really can see and get involved with it's like a birthday you know it comes along once a year and it's really good to celebrate those things um and when you see how many kids are there and how much enjoyment people and families are getting out of it you feel good about the the things that the council do in this area now of course uh james and phil were a no-show but they did turn up a little bit later and you'll see them up there but the links that some people to go to to participate in this event and and do something for the kids I mean that would have scared the hell out of me if I was a young kid but um yeah they looked absolutely fantastic those two and uh allowed me to take a a photo of them excellent moving right along rafiki domain natural play proposal so you know in our city we have some pretty unique playgrounds obviously margaret maher in town and this is like a new concept and an natural play area um that is being put together by the guardians of rafiti who have also been funded through the um shovel ready projects so it's going to have things like log steps and native garden wheelchair wheelchair accessible fort you wouldn't see too many of those around so that'll be something new a tp village uh swings slides and then a a net nest um yeah so just something uh unique and interesting another asset to the sort of brighton community so eastern community sport and recreation I've talked about them a bit before they're a group that got quite a bit of funding from the government for a number of great projects that they uh are involved in in rafiti domain and around um you've made a real difference to the community and we just uh we got a report from from them about where they're at on a number of things um and an impressive array of things uh flood lighting at thompson park I mean these are the people that were involved in the large canopy uh for're finalizing the lease footprint for the cricket pavilion upgrading of tennis courts uh and then they're also involved in installing lighting at the south brighton tennis club uh very big and active club uh in south brighton so I think we'll just show that video is it the last one there chris before we finish hmm mm-hmm thank you very much um yeah haven't_''_470.639 answered any questions it was lovely thank you um questions I've got a question do you know that uh the new brighton rugby football club are holding their 100th anniversary on easter weekend and that's one of the the real hubs of that community it's got obviously a long history and that's where the eastern community and sports and recreation is basing themselves and they've expanded the rugby club from just a rugby club to squash to all these different sports so it's a it's quite it'll be a big celebration and a great celebration and also did you know that this weekend the duke surfing festival is on you for pointing them out no I asked you a question he was just giving the answer thank you did you know that the student volunteer army is going down um donald dunnell park uh on saturday morning uh to do a big clean up a big clean up there's a big cleaner yeah so did you know that no I well I did because you told me uh earlier actually then we have one more thing um the the coast the coast event was held um a couple of weeks ago um are we going to put that so we had some photos there just at the of the finish line I don't know whether you and most of you know that um they take a whole lot of sand um and put it up uh some steps so the finish line is like is quite high up and and over the uh you can see over all of brighton it's uh so many people turn up those photos I took in the early afternoon with hapuna taiwan are looking fantastic and all the landscaping done and I with porto williams who was welcoming people at the finish line um so yeah this year sorry she didn't run up the street no no no I think it was it just killed you last time oh yeah we got second in the family team so and my son is a very good athlete summer's looking forward to having it back next year it's not going to happen traffic management took it away well yeah it was always the logical fit now james I'm assuming that you are moving that and I'm assuming that phil is uh seconding it so any discussion put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you very good um look I'll just kind of because
Welcome leanne and andrew sorry we kicked away that surround we put that and we clicked away being on as requested um it takes us to item seven the zone committee annual report and I'd like to welcome the chairs and deputy chairs of the zone committees and thanks for giving up your time to come and talk to us today because I think it's really important that we're here straight from you so first off we have got the bank's peninsula zone committee gina welcome to the table morning thank you um so today I'm speaking in place of bonita wakefield who unfortunately has had to resign as chair due to health reasons um so I just like to acknowledge her contribution as chair over the past two years she's done a lot to create a really warm welcoming atmosphere at our meetings where committee members and members of the public felt comfortable and encouraged to contribute we are lucky to have bonita continue on though as the runanga rep for wairiwa she's just wanting to slow down a bit right I for her hard work too yeah thank you and we'll be electing a new chair and deputy at our next meeting this month I'd also like to acknowledge the other committee members and uh councillor turner and staff who support us particularly ccc staff liz riley our secretary and marian schoenfeld who took over from peter kingsbury last year as our council representative overall the committee had a good year last year with minimal disruption from covert we approved four excellent projects from the immediate steps biodiversity fund and continue to have more projects put forward than can be funded each year we're very pleased to have been the first stone committee to co-author youth member with irena riddle completing her first year now she was selected from the youth ropu we've continued to work through what is coming up to be our third year in our three year action plan and the committee is looking forward to working to the new terms of reference following last year's review which aligns well with the direction that the committee has already been taking going forward the on three catchments for a set period of time likely two to three years rather than the previous approach which attempted to cover the whole peninsula and that resulted in a bit more of a scattergun effect so we're hoping that by targeting our resources like this it will result in better queue to kita outcomes from the mountains to the sea in the selected catchments and with better landowner and community engagement one community where we already have good engagement and a high turnout at the annual meeting that we've had there over the last few years is wainui and would love to see that in other catchments I've already previously mentioned the septic tank study in wainway which was released in september last year but just to summarize again they found high levels of fecal contamination in the lower catchment um but with only minor contribution from human sources the majority being avian and to a lesser extent from stock though the human contribution may have been higher in wet weather interviews with residents found that many septic tank systems are old and uncertainty over that many residents are reluctant to invest in maintenance grades of their systems lastly I covered this in december but I'd just like to reiterate um that the committee were pleased to be able to provide early end input into the ltp with the letter sent to council in november last year the committee's top priorities are biodiversity funding for immediate steps but also including bigger picture projects some examples would be similar to the bank's peninsula trusts t project to create a thousand hectare biodiversity hub in the southern port hills and rod donald trusts efforts to purchase land above autumn bradley park that includes the summits of mount herbert and mount bradley implementation of the whakaora whakaraupu catchment management plan in littleton harbour with emphasis on erosion and sediment control particularly roadside cuttings implementation of the waireawa subregional plan zipper recommendations including ongoing funding for the wiriword bank stabilization project to secure community and farm water supplies while retaining ecosystem health this includes funding preparation work towards a plan change to enable more realistic and responsive management of streams and water tax on banks peninsula uh sufficient to protect water quantity um and its effects on ecosystem health now and into the future um that ccc and he can jointly fund staff's staff time to support and advise landowners on effective management of on-site wastewater systems as well as promoting mahangakai recovery through increased funding of fish barrier removal risk assessment for adaptation to climate change particularly in relation to freshwater ecosystem health and lastly weed management to protect biodiversity and that's all I have today that's all you have that's huge that's incredible enough work thank you very much hey look um just one question on the wainui um because that is a big issue if people are not upgrading their septics and they're old because they don't know what our work program is so I wonder if we could get a memo through to the zone committee on what our intentions are in that work program whether we have funding in the ltp for wai nui or or a time frame of when that might be so that people have got certainty like if we're we're intending to do it soon then they might wait because that's that that's obviously is that where the e coli is coming from in the winery stream as well and some of it um do you want to answer that challenge take a seat the study happened when there was no rainfall so it might have been that if it had rained at the time of the study the human sources might have been greater in terms of the evidence but I was just thinking rather than sending the zone committee a memo the zone company already knows that the city council is very unlikely for doing any kind of articulation there for at least 10 years or more it's more the local community that needs to know and they may have they may have already been told through the community board or through the city council staff so you'd rather be sent it through to the community board and ask them to advise the community yeah okay that's great thank you for that guidance if there's no other questions we can much just that that we listed the you head at the end of things that you'd quite like us to be doing and helping with more funding through that's not in the actual report that was just an additional wheelis yes so that was a letter that was sent uh in november um as a way for the pre-enlightenment yeah early input and just checking process wise do the zone committees get to submit on the ltp don't think so because they're committees of council okay so we need to maybe have the zoning committees coming in a similar way that um the community boards do so the community boards are committees of council and they get discipline so we need to work out some way of having better and more formal input I think from the zone committees I think it would be good if they could can we can we get some clarification on that david with his own committees that would be great thanks sarah seems crazy that they can't yeah and yeah yeah gina thank you um I'm I'm member and you're the first zone committee to do that what was the process did she approach you or how did you how did you make that happen um she attended a few of our meetings and base uh actually two youth members from the rap who did um and yeah it was just through discussions um between committee members and and aaron and um we then sort of took the initiative to um create a role um and I i think as well as that the staff involved in the ekin youth will poo helped work through the process and helped to ensure that the young people you know would be a good environment for them and and figuring out transport and things like that but with the zonkeny review process last year it'll now be that all zone committees can have a youth member and they just have they're exactly the same as every other member of the committee with exactly the same yes there's one that already has so that's good thanks very much thank you oh sorry phil thanks guys that go and have me have a look at that um near river recharge thing to see sort of how it works and what it does is it I'm not familiar with that but it's on the that's another zone committee oh sorry so I've gone too fast sorry I'm here all day that's the salon yeah okay thanks very much gina thank you question miss melton kevin brown welcome to the table top that I'm sure you will no this report's fairly brief I gave a summary of the annual report at the last meeting so in between then and now there's been only one meeting since the previous report this was in february it was really interesting meeting it was a joint meeting that we held between the three zone committees with christchurch west melton salon and banks peninsula and we had this joint meeting to share experiences and to discuss the new purpose and functions which together with the three council's priorities to share experiences about successful products and how they became successful and how they were undertaken policy statements 2020 and things like that and to learn about a new water data project from ecam two days ago the zone committee paid a three-hour visit to the otakai kino waterway this year the zone committee has decided to make this waterway a priority for a majority of its immediate steps funding we had representatives there from the local runanga the isaac conservation trust ecan seas city council water and the water and wildlife habitat trust and we heard about the cultural significance of the water in mexica the work that the isaac trust is doing in maintaining pathways and walks in the area the ecology of the river and the use of the land under lease from ecan the committee last year had a voted to suggest to ecan that the land that is currently under lease is leased out to farmers for grazing and the uh motion was that it be moved from grazing to conservation to protect some of the plants and other biodiversity present in the area we met in early february with clive appleton from the council here to firm up plans for stormwater management plan for their powerhog heathcote catchment jointly with clive we came up with a plan for meetings for drop-in centers display boards and things like that the consultation process has now been pushed back to after the mid year but the concept of how to get this consultation going is now in place um it was pleasing to see that there's been some movement in research into the correlation between low levels of nitrate in the drinking water and colorectal cancer recently publicized research was the first step in looking at this link as I understand it and I haven't seen the actual paper yet there was a study to see if the data was available and if if it was possible to actually do the correlation in any event it made headlines and kept the issue in the public eye and this council actually wrote to the minister and got this actual research going it's it's extremely important for christchurch because christchurch's drinking water could be affected to the point where nitrate levels are high enough to actually cause some problem if just before our next meeting this month we'll be signing the community waterways partnership charter together with this council and ecam we're looking forward to that and finally our meeting at the end of this month is planned to be a workshop to put together an action plan for the committee for the next three year period and this is part of the re-jigging of the zone committee's purpose and functions as decided by the merrell forum so that's all I have it's been a holiday time and we've only had one meeting you know that that's huge work thanks kevin and um there's good news about the nitrates study so that's been given the go ahead to actually do our own one yeah here um and you don't have any idea of the time frame for that no I don't unfortunately I'm trying to find out a bit more about it um it just came out in the newspapers a couple of days ago yeah and that is really important yeah it's a joint study ultimately study between victoria university and otago medical school right so I know that in our submission to the plan change seven think criteria city council suggested a level of 1.8 what do you see as an acceptable level um the danish study proved a significant correlation between colorectal cancer and nitrate levels of 0.85 so it's um definitely lower than that level 1.8 yeah and it's it's a it was a huge study it was a um 1.7 million people followed for 35 years so it's um it's amazing yeah and we we can't use it because they say it didn't really relate to our environment and they oh well we need to find out yeah so hopefully this research will be done they I mean there's uh data around for whereabouts this cancer is uh prevalent and uh if it correlates with high natural nitrate areas which we know then that's all we're asking for you you have a well don't you yes I don't drink our water no you distill it we distill it yeah uh I'm in west melton and it varies between about five and 12 depending on the time of the year and the rainfall so that's quite bad and there's there's a huge number of uh farmers properties in the canterbury plains that all rely on these wells most of them aren't analyzed and most of them don't know well I think we've done a good good thing getting those letters off the zone committee instigated that this council picked it up supported by you can and we've got some action happening so that's a good news story I know yannI's got a question to someone jake did you have one or over this erin signoni do you have a question just with the danish study is there water similar to ours as in does it get filtered for 1600 they have yeah they have varying levels of nitrate um and they just follow those levels through for the 35 years and yeah it's a similar sort of um similar sort of country I guess they have a lot of but not our deep ones where it's the aquifers of running water that's uh 1600 years old type thing you mean for christchurch yeah yeah no christchurch yeah the shallow bores are the main problem at the moment but um the some modelling numerical modeling by ear can show that water is coming through from waimakariri district which is going to have higher nitrate and this will end up in some of the deeper bores ultimately the more you more water you take out of the deeper bores you'll be dragging in some of that surface water into into those deeper bores so ultimately I mean it might be 20 50 years away but something you've got to look at now sorry no no no that's a guess it could be it could be a long time for it to get there but if the council is moving to more uh deeper bores then uh you'll lower the pressure and more water will be coming in to fill up the uh of course it will be moving to deeper wars to get away from to say uh irrigated deering but um I uh that's not my field yeah and it's agriculture in horticulture it's it's agriculture horrific here we want to get on yeah uh don't know sorry I do all I know is that um our values at home are quite high and we're not alone in this I i have kit for measuring uh nitrate and stuff at home so I do neighbors and some people further away and some of the values are all quite high okay thank you in regards to the response do you think we could should we be getting those now for nitrate levels yeah the the nitrate levels the drinking water levels in new zealand are set by basically they accept the who drinking water levels which are set at approximately 11.3 50 parts per million of nitrate or about 11.3 parts per million of nitrate nitrogen the zone committee can advocate for those levels to be altered which you are doing in which the government's also looking at through the future that's right yeah and there's a recent national policy statement about nitrates and so um it's it's um it's been looked at at the moment yeah about the target management you can do I guess um that's not my game but um you can but the strategy is not a statutory document so it doesn't overrule it doesn't sit higher than plans and national policy his own committee's recommended yeah I mean the key the key driver would be what happens when the study comes out I guess that's right even evidence-based yep then I just kind of wanted to acknowledge the fact that that you had raised this um and and it came up at one of these reports that you'd written to the ministry of health and back in 2019 I followed that up with correspondence on behalf of this council in relation to the precautionary approach the government as you know has established a task force to investigate the relationship of nitrates um and I've got a briefing here at the council this friday and I just wondered whether I should make together to the briefing it's just at four o'clock on friday uh with um uh dr tim chambers who's one of the uh well he's a senior research fellow and a member of the government's nitrates and drinking water task force so I just given that it's just so close and we've been following up on this as a result of you raising us at your one of these reports right which has actually emphasized the significance of the reporting process that we instituted um yeah that would be that would be great I'd love to come along soon so dave could you send that through to kevin please sir in the details thanks leanne thank you very much and um of course the the christian hbs melton zone committee is very focused on stormwater work and improving our contaminants or removing our contaminants at source in our urban environment and I love the picture here you've got even smith with him being presented as a stormwater hero and that's that's a great project the stormwater heroes so that ad hoc member on one of our working groups so um we we miss him a lot yes we all do yeah I could add speaking of evan um this weekend is the grow event at the botanic gardens and there will be a display a stormwater superheroes display there which will include a very hot off the press the stormwater superhero mobile resource is being picked up today from the engineers oh really and so it will be there and that was that was evan's idea that mobile resource it will also be at the community water partnership launch um if and if you don't mind I just mentioned that the process for finding new committee members is coming up which happens annually and that will be advertised but it will be opened you know the advertising period will be between the 12th of april and the 10th of may so it starts the day after ltp consultation ends and then there will be workshops for the panels to you know meet the applicants and go through that appointment process and that will be from the 17th the councillors on your the city council councils who are involved in those zone committees right well thanks for the headset it comes around quickly doesn't it and that um stormwater mobile resource has been a long time in the in the making well absolutely not not that long what four years or something I don't know but it's a wonderful educational resource isn't it to show people what happens to your stormwater and everything that you put down your that's right stormwater pipe goes into the river and it's the city council who's paid for most of it e-cans perhaps put in more time but the city council had um more of the money and a number of community groups have helped design it yeah well let's still get down there and have a look at it because it's cool hey thanks very much guys I'd like to welcome liz von holler from the selwyn zone committee nice to see you liz thank you uh um I for the ones who don't know me I'm losing hello zones I am the co-chair there um with fiona mcdonald she I've seen to apologize today she committed to work um I'd like to also at this stage of knowledge um uh current uh councillor galloway for her and put into our zone committee it's unfortunate that your committees hold on the tuesday and the same times the houses so she's unable to get to the emotion but then when we have other things outside at times you endeavor to get there as you see in their uh 2020 annual report last year we did a lot of community engagement and talking to the community about their concerns um we used the information through our new action plan for the next three years um which we did just recently uh last month and it was and the activities we did last year fits well with the changes to our terms of reference we hosted several public meetings that collaborated the support community members doing great work and it gave them the opportunity to tell us what else they needed a lot of um talk and community nitrates in it we've been inundated with that request how how they can have their wells tested um at this stage they paying for our own pocket and and having to pay for their own filters and everything like that so there is a bit of concern about the expense off and their drinking well everybody's entitled to fresh drinking water uh we report it to you at four times assisi four times and will now uh be doing the same to ecan and and um so in district council there's a new concept to come in for them as well that we report four times a year instead of just the ones also we light down to try and change the personnel who does the print presentations together for and down on me all the time to do this because that gives a better outlook and perspective from across the board that's that's good we import um we had 10 important projects uh opening vents in our zone and one of them was the near water recharge I'll talk to you uh when and we show uh we support and encourage the putt um you know we participate fully on them uh we we recommend over a hundred thousand dollars for ucan biodiversity um through immediate steps um funding uh over the last year uh we also farewelled two of our low serving members and ron paulo and um and uh ellen lynn um we have do have uh that makes us quite short on on the ground we've always one short anyway so now we're three short sometimes it's hard to get a um quorum at our summer meetings but the refresh is coming up within the next couple of months so we're hoping we actually have no farmers on board at the moment or nobody from the farm industry even so we're hoping to get some farmers on board because really it is a farming area so we need that on our committee yeah I hope it doesn't turn back the way it was all farmers but never mind we'll get there oh we nearly finished our uh our new action plan uh we the suggestion priority from your council ecan and so on district council and our plans were committed to facilitate a community-wide approach and I think that's what we need and because a lot of people in the community don't even know what cwms is or who we are or where we're from within so we've hoping to push our further out into the community in fact we haven't had a meeting at southwind district council in over two years so we've had all our missions out in the community maybe a lot more at lincoln now than other communities but we are out and about just unfortunately we have meant to have our uh meeting two weeks ago at uh the power of morky at a time or two but with covet uh coming over that we had to cancel that and that was mainly going to be on uh timon or tawai in mahinga thai and the cultural aspect of a region um but unfortunately we had to cancel that we will fit in on a later date um he had done a the uh the white territory uh I'm sorry the right ticket why uh no I didn't sorry I'll go back again there's two two rivers side by side the white carrot carrying uh sarwin rivers we've done a lot of work on that we've had a working group for two years and we almost come to the ian of that uh working group and they've failed a lot of recommendations back to us and then we are discoordinating them at the moment and going back to council is and so where we need our support in that we support the action of the restorer of tiwara we want to try and restore it back to some sort of healthy state and the only way we can see that happening is we have to clean up all the trivia trees first to stop the contaminants get into the lake and once we start that we then can concentrate on how we clean the lake up because it's pointless try and clean the lake up first then clean up the tree for tourism uh awareness about private water drinking we've already gone through that and I think that's very important one I mean we do have people uh especially down the sowen hearts which is right right down the low end of the water line and that's where there is a lot of concentrate of nitrates in our action plans we have a lot of words like assist with investigate a team or host that one of those ones we do attend a lot of the school plantings and community plantings in their area we go out and just have chats well they might actually plant plants from them as well collaborate uh promote uh seeing the representation and one's coming up in the very near future is the field day at the curry we're going to be out there and make sure we have a good presence out there and get our messages out there and I think that's a very another important thing we've got to get the message out to do some requests if I don't understand they want help send letters to going to do a lot more of that um we're going to develop a lot more advice through our workshops and and stuff like that especially we had a drop in series on farmers but they with clive at 19 they sort of went back backwards that one but we will start those type of things up again we would like to thank the crisis center council for your ongoing support for our committee and also request continuing con conversation um with us about the future role of each time and great times to come oh thank you very much what a great report it's really interesting reading I'm sorry wee bit squeezed for time today but and I know phil wants to ask you about a site visit but could you just give us a quick heads up on what the um waikira kitty recharge project actually is what does it do it is a project um program how does it work from the central plains water yep and what it does it takes halfway between the uh pot halfway down the pipeline and can draw like a dark field and then that's released into the more into the hororata than the white territory we we find that um for cultural reasons we didn't want to go straight in the white territory we wanted to down through uh groundwater at the first before it reaches the white country uh or running water would have come from the waimakariri no it comes from yeah is a alpine fed river the waikira kerry is a springfield river so we didn't want to mix those waters because we don't know what would have happened if it did and at the other end like uh tewara so what's the picture in the report what's the weak building there what is it well that that's just the way the pump house is the water goes through into that then you see those pipes coming out in front of it yep we can open those up well they can open them up if we want three open nothing open three but they normally what we'll not have is open the right up and right 800 meters uh then they can turn the pipes back as needed stop the flooding oh cool okay so um a film major wants to go and have a look how would he organize that can you contact me there'll be two avenues I can find out more about about uh central plains water and contact them or adopt a brent painter um he'd been major lead on the recharge uh either contact to remember I can find them okay so we could actually get david to get you the contacts from central plains if you want all right if there's no more questions for liz excellent report thank you oh and I just wanted to just comment on the fact of the terrific focus that has been placed here on community and the way that we've identified that it really is coming from the bottom up in terms of taking responsibility for our waterway so I also want to acknowledge the work that leeds are just doing you know he's really passionate about it and really appreciate what you're doing thanks then I we're just going to put a note about the memo to banks peninsula community board um to inform the wainui community on our where we are with the wainui wastewater project where we are where we are not um okay so I'm happy to move these zone committee report to be received andrew will second that um just wait for that goes up to the exponential no no community board the progress of focus I suppose is there any progress on the winery wastewater project the city council great okay any comments you want to make andrew um thank you and I'll just keep this brief I'd also like to acknowledge um benita wakefield and the contribution that she's made to the bank's peninsula zone committee in her time as chair um she certainly fostered a collaborative way of working um a very relaxed but at the same time no-nonsense approach to the work of the committee and as we've heard from gina today the committee's making significant progress across what really is the large and very varied area of banks peninsula each really with its own um separate sets of issues so I'd like to um thank benita for her commitment um and for everything that she's contributed to the success and the effectiveness of the committing and then the other thing I wanted to pick up on was the point that sarah drew out through questions um the zone committees have been advised that they don't have the ability to submit to either the um city council ltp or the ecan ltp because they are sub-bodies of each council we really do need to find an effective way for them to get their messages across whether that is through formal submissions or whether it's through some other process there is of course an urgency here because either they need to be able to submit as part of the submission period that we're about to open or otherwise there needs to be some kind of parallel process that allows for that information to land within that same time period so if somebody can pick that up I don't think we need a resolution but if and more to the point come back to the zone committees um I think that would be very helpful thanks andrew and I think that the letters have been received I think we should dig those out and present them to councillors as part of our ltp discussions as well um but I also like to appreciate andrew's words as well and thank you again for giving up your time to come in it's really valuable and I think the zone committees are becoming stronger and stronger and gaining more and more respect and and seeing more action from your recommendations so I'm really really proud to um to be sitting here and receiving these reports which I think are really good and they're really interesting for us all to see what work is being done on our most precious resource in our whole community and to see the level of collaboration through from community up communities where it starts and right through to collaborating with all organizations working together and it's what you guys are doing pulling all this together and driving it and again for all the work james kiara I'd like to add to the comments previously made about benita wakefield not just for the fact that she represents which is where I a puppet too but the fact that she has a phd in kopapa maori environmental health and that's a significant resource to have in our community so I wanted to put that on the table too kia ora all right I'll put the recommendation all those in favor say aye aye all right oppose that's carried thank you everyone okay so we move on to the next item which is the resource
Okay and we've got the um banks peninsula community board report uh tori peden and no tyrone today and penelope penelope goldstone community government everybody great um just before we get started um we recently had conversations with nzta and I think having conversations with community boards and nzta directly regarding state highways was very valuable and even ndta has said it's great to hear perspective from from the local area um and they did say they're coming out to the community for consultation on speed limits so that's really good to hear that nzta are doing public consultation so look that relationship needs to continue with it with another board yeah I saw the chief executive wrote a letter on that very issue focusing on little river but the whole corridor is being reassessed so the timing was perfect and um and just having that conversation congratulations to your board because having those relationships really really matter yeah so okay hopefully other boards get a chance to do that as well so right akara just recently the um server center has been closed and the acaro community and school library we have had mandy many public forum come in about this issue um and with this there's also consideration um to close the service desk completely I know that is coming forward in the ltp but um it has been noted within the community that it's a recently refurbished acura service and moving those services to the the library is a concern with the ongoing ltp like I said this has been public forum to the community board with the proposal of closing service centres the next nearest service centre to akara would be little river and that's over 30 minutes away so residents are quite concerned about this especially when there's a lot of elderly residents in the area recently we had a hui in akira two of the main issues one of which was around the service centre we have had good attendance we have had vocal community about service centre issues and also at the huey we had staff there regarding the water issues so a really well attended hui it was really well run by council staff vocal but it was well run and and we thank staff and community members for keeping that um what's the word it was it's civilized it was very civilized another issue brought to the board recently is um fire hazards now casper fire started due to a tree branch um that could fire cowlines at burn 15 hectares of um of hillside concern from neighbours of rimau reserve so it's a council reserve and that fire breaks had not been constructed so I know that staff are looking at that and those issues have been brought to the community board but it is ongoing issues that are being raised with us yearly especially post port house fires there is ongoing issues again around fire risk and what we're doing about that there's also concerns from acura and different areas as well regarding fire risk and keeping it short brief today the last one is just regarding the acrob or water notice staff working hard to sort this problem out unfortunately residents were misinformed they had to boil water from the tanker that got delivered from want to give much thanks to the water team they have um done their best with a situation that nobody asked for um residents have been incredibly grateful for what staff are doing and um the communications going out about that so I'd just like to pass on my thanks to the water team and also the comms team for just really going above and beyond and helping our community get through this time and I hope to see that that ball wouldn't notice comes down shortly that's that's all I have to update with you over the last few weeks um um yeah james giorda uh tori sorry I missed the beginning of your presentation what was the what what's happened with nzta oh sorry used to ndta we we asked um regarding different things coming um issues coming up the board and regarding state highway so we did actually have a conversation with entertainer and they came around the table so it was great just to say that we're actually talking and passing on the community concerns regarding speed limit regarding conditions why I encourage you know other boards to if they get a chance to speak to ncta pass on those things and have you had progress you know they're going out to public consultation yeah public consultation routing speed limit on state highways yeah where is it from from hall's wall essentially all the way through to other but from what nzta was telling us is that they are doing public consultation on their speed limit review they've never done that before because these and ta are you know governing bodies themselves basically can I suggest um a kinda kind um suggestion that you contact the runang because that's why they they will be consulting with the with um but let them know that you've been and sorry in that situation in that position where you you've had a meeting with them that's fantastic yeah no I was speaking to a young cramer the other day so I didn't pass that on so no it's all good progress and just having that conversation is just fantastic maybe we'll get a ce just describing what's happened because um you know that it is going to be an engaged process and and there will be a lot of interest from the runanga as well yeah andrew you want to move this and do I have a secondary mike davidson any um discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it's carrie thank you very much thank you thanks tori thank you and last but not least the waitai coastal burwood community
I can invite people to please take their seats and then we'll open the meeting is we're matching foreign good morning and welcome we'll start with item one apologies and I've got an apology from um councillor templeton for a partial absence and an apology from um councillor tim skandera for lateness I'm happy to move those apologies pauline you're second all those in favor say aye against that's carried declarations of interest um so we're noting a declaration of interest from the mayor and from myself in item 20 the christchurch foundation item 3 confirmation of previous minutes I'm happy to move those previous minutes sam will second all those in favor say aye and resolution to include the supplementary report um can I have a mover sam will move sarah will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried and now we move to item 4 which is the public forum and I'd like to invite nick williams to the table nick thank you for joining us this morning and under the um public forum thank you good morning chair mayor councillors everyone the reason why I'm here is we all know the canterbury multi-use stadium will be built and a great asset for the city will house a number of events throughout the year and what I am proposing is a tourist attraction which would be incorporated into the outside design of the stadium which will make the stadium a draw card outside of planned events now just to tell you a little bit more about what I'm proposing I have a licensing agreement with the swede and rotorua what I can do is show you a photo here of the sweep um so essentially what it is is a dual mono rail track with suspended cycle pods uh traveling up to 50 kilometers an hour instead of riding upright you're actually lying down and peddling its mixture of manual and electric power over a 200 meter course it was opened in 2007 by john key in rotorua and has since had over 300 000 rides um currently it costs over fifty dollars to experience so three hundred thousand times for in revenue and I actually think the same concept here in the heart of christchurch could do actually better because where it is in rotorua is located on the outskirts so boris johnson the current uk prime minister was proposing a concept similar to this called the fly outside the olympic stadium in london when he was the mayor of london in 2011 so I also happen to have another licensing agreement with skyride technologies which have a prototype track in the in the us they have several products but I'd like um to add the sky chaser to the multi-use arena so essentially what the sky chaser is is you are suspended in a harness and lie horizontally and have an electric throttle so essentially you ride like superman at over 50 kilometers an hour um I actually think the sky chaser uh would be more popular than the swede and would generate just as much in its own right uh so I'm actually proposing two monorail tracks uh one for the swede and another for the sky chaser which would have a few dips and turns so this tourist attraction would be safe fun fast quiet cheaper than bungee jumping and competitive as you can race against each other and would be a major draw card now with all due respect to the tram and pump and punting on the avon which is sedentary these two attractions would be a little bit more high octane and get the blood pumping so to speak like if you take auckland for example they've got um with the harbour bridge they've got a number of thrill-seeking attractions and as does the sky tower but christchurch doesn't have something like this close to the heart of the city so what I would like to propose is a cantilever system that it be adopted we buy steel beams jut out at regular intervals around the outside of the stadium these would be engineered in a way so that they would have adequate load bearing capabilities so essentially two monorail tracks would be suspended off these steel beams with a sky chaser on top and the sweep underneath a star finished platform would need to be erected so that a possible cafe snack snack bar could be located uh in close proximity as well so if if the council were to give the green light what I would like to do is to speak to the stadium's structural engineer and architect to work out costs and in turn put forward a solid business plan uh together outlining all indicative costs uh because I feel this could be a great attraction for the city and potentially christchurch city council could have a financial stake in this uh thank you for your time and if there's any questions all right so you've left a very short time for questions james you've indicated already that you've got a question yes um kiara nick and congratulations and where have you been all of our lives that's a great idea oh sorry you'd like a little bit of a rundown about my experiences thank you all right thank you look thanks very much indeed for the presentation and for um showing us those visuals this morning um and I mean yeah certainly your description of you know you could do on the tram or the um or the punting um I mean your idea obviously is that this could be integrated with the build of a stadium um I think what we should do is refer this to our staff first of all to look at that suggestion but also to look at what other possibilities there might be for the kind of thing that you're talking about as well yes so um yeah we we have just given you the five minutes this morning but it's certainly something that we can refer to our staff um to see whether this is able to be integrated or added into you know maybe the stadium or maybe other things that are um possibilities that could happen in the future so thank you very much indeed for your time coming along this morning thank you and we can just refer that to staff in that way there's no need for us to pass a resolution to do so or anything yeah that's great thank you all right so now moving on um to item five six there are none so that brings us to the performance exceptions report for january and peter welcome to the table and I'll just ask you to make any remarks on this report before we move to questions thank you good morning thank you uh the overwhelming uh impression of this report is stability uh results are very much the same for uh levels of service and uh capital uh as there were in the last report um we've got some of the key managers here to help answer questions on some of the levels of service exceptions if that's required um but we're sitting at um just over 80 on level of service delivery uh compared to 81 and a bit for uh september last year so very stable uh view um having said that uh my team and the executive team have developed a process for targeting levels of service that might be salvageable before year end so rather than a flat report that lists everything we're now taking those ambers to the executive team and working with the managers concerned to say close with a bit of extra effort focused teamwork intervention it's possible these could be brought over the line by year-end and so for the second half of the year there's quite a focus on getting those that might be rescued and hopefully that 80 will go up to the 85 that you were looking for there's not many required to do it and the focus is there um we'll look at specific ones when we get to the exceptions appendix at the back in terms of the capital program uh the watch list this is watchlist projects in whole of life which is a different view from from what the project management office will give you for the current year we're sitting at 90 you might notice from the historical trends graph there that both the major cycleways and watchlist projects are significantly tighter compared to the historic norms um and the watch list has only really been at 90 once before since july 18. so both sets of work are coming in very close uh being much more tightly managed than historically they of the other graphs because they simply reflect that stability around the level of service delivery and that takes us through the through to the exceptions themselves at this point um I just remind you that um I endeavor to answer the questions I can but these these cover the entire spectrum of council services and there will be times when I can't answer and we need to defer to the subject matter expert we have helen here who can talk to any of the three water issues but if it's a particularly technical issue I may have to ask you for permission to come back with a report from the manager concerned rather than answering it on the spot so if there are any questions about the exceptions I'm happy to take them now or go back to the subject matter expert as required there is also one level of service proposed for deletion and we have some wording in the resolution on that that is the level of service around supporting business sector resource efficiency there's simply an error there from the staff that annual plan the level of service that goes with that budget should have also been deleted so the area is now seeking permission from council to formally delete that level of service that won't trigger any consultation implications it's not a significant level of service in a significant activity council can decide to delete it we just need to notify audit to cover any reporting implications at your end so uh with that um does anybody have any questions about the exceptions themselves all right thank you um peter and and thanks for highlighting you know that one of the key features of this report is is stability um that's is that something that we're expecting to to continue to to be a theme until year end by and large when you're at this point in the year you're seeing very close to what you'll get at year end that's historically the pattern um that doesn't mean something can't_``_2358.4 happen we've certainly learned that over the years but um by and large what we're trying to do is can find rather than seeing any great volatility and thanks for drawing attention to that new what you might call targeted intervention approach that's highlighted in paragraph 1.5 and 1.6 in the report and thanks for highlighting that and then my my only other question relates to the um level of service that's the subject of that additional recommendation so this is the second bullet point on page 21 of our agenda um out of the five new levels service exceptions this month three are forecast red will fail to meet target two in strategic planning and policy for supporting business sector resource efficiency this target will not be met because the consultancy budget was removed following the covered lockdown budget review so what we're saying peter is that this was simply an error where we move we removed the funding and we made an error in not removing the corresponding levels of service at the same time that's correct it was a um a difficult time of year for the staff and it's simply an error that the level of service should have been more of a technical question the report refers to two levels of service in strategic planning and policy and the resolution just refers to one level of service is there a is there a second level of service that should be added into this resolution no the resolution is correct it refers to um level of service 17.0.34.2 while there are two that are exceptions only one is proposed for deletion and that's the resource efficiency one so the other one stands yes so we're expecting to continue we're expecting to meet the level of service or to continue monitoring that level of service on the other one that's right it stands so there was no error with one the one in the resolution is the one that there was an error with yes all right that's fine thank you very much all right moving to other questions yanny just just note on the pt infrastructure that we're um target's 86 percent can you give page numbers 28. um the monthly average is 77 percent I'm just really concerned at the um public transport bus priority lanes down rickett road and main north road and so are we able to get some sort of evaluation of what's causing the delay and what effectiveness that investment has had because some of us have raised continuously the concern that although we spend a lot of money on those projects the benefit that we actually get for journey time isn't being matched because of other things that happen along that corridor and you know maine north road was a classic where we put a signalized pedestrian crossing um that stopped traffic at the same time we put a clear way in for the bus to increase it's it's its flow so I'm just concerned that we have a better remedial action than that one um to really understand what's causing the problem given the amount of money that we've invested in it that that's a completely fair observation I'll work with richard to come back to you with a more detailed uh a remedial action that will be more detailed thank you um it's possible may be able to help you okay um through you mr chair in terms of the bus priority measures throughout christchurch we we don't actually have a comprehensive um program or suite or network of of bus priority measures we have a lot of bits and parts of the network which work they work okay to put it bluntly um they're not very well aligned at this stage and and hence the reason why the organisation has approved the business case late last year to put more investment into public transport and ensure that those key routes the five key routes do have um public transport priority measures along them but at the moment there are a lot of gaps in those key corridors so that's one of the reasons why you will see that level of service that we struggle to meet of course as you'll be aware we also don't run the buses and there's only so much we can do as an organisation to improve on that we can provide the pt priority measures but there's a whole lot of we're just a bit player on that so sorry can we get can we get a report back then or a memo on the journey time savings that have accrued to the bus priority lanes that we've put in and what what the expected outcome was when we approved the project versus what's actually happened since those bus lanes are in is that something we could get um could you tell me a project you're referring to you're referring to the road ones or the um road ones there's rickett and road and there's papua new york so that yeah look in terms of rickard and bro in terms of papino road we we put some measures in pre-quake but there was always a gap on main north road of which we've addressed recently so um but there's still gaps in that network if you look at merivale as well obviously that the buses get held up along there so we haven't got a continuous network of priority measures with respect like my question is for the investment that we it to get the benefit how do we know how that's performing that's all I'm interested in the chair is too early for the starter in all fairness rich is telling us that it's not complete yet so we can't really it's mr chair it's a bit like pudding and um so you've got a major cycle and you're putting a couple of sections and you've left out another section of course it's not going to work at an optimal matter if you put in the whole program that's when you get the benefits and that's what the business case the council endorsed prior to christmas I understand that but when we approved we had a big debate at this council and we were given um benefit journey times of approving the expenditure right and all I'm asking for is to understand what's happened with those journey times not the whole row I appreciate that for the whole route it'll be different right but for the ones that we've signed up signed off the improvement that's going to happen we must be able to measure that so has the improvements do so has the project delivered the improvements that were expected realizing that that's only a small part of and I'm not expecting stuff to answer that today but I think when you look at this performance measure and see that we're not meeting that target it would be good to understand the nature of the investment that we've made and the benefits that we expected to see whether it's happened or not all right so richard are you able to take that away and come back to us with an answer which may reflect the answer that you've provided verbally but there may be something that goes back to the information that was put in front of council when we made that decision and whether we're achieving what was expected um from the decision that we made at that time comparing what's happening on the ground to um service improvements that we expected from any information that was provided to support the thank you thanks and just the final question from me was on page 30 and it's just looking at the um roads and footpaths that respond to customer service requests within appropriate time frames and it says changes are still required to the hybris sla response times pending provision of transport ticket structure um it's a key priority change is already made of shown to a reporting better reflecting a response to currently 80 percent compared to 33 that was being reported and greater than 80 as council's typical target which is now being achieved that I just found that section quite confusing um so basically a target is greater than 95 percent um we've got a typical target that's lower than that and there's a change to the system which has increased it from 33 to 80. so essentially um what that's largely referring to is a transport maintenance contracts and within them we have different response times across the board so depending on what it is um you know that the maintenance contractor should be responding either within a few hours months within which for us to come up to a solution with the problem when um you know these were initially put in through the um hybrid system um that probably didn't reflect the range of response times in there so that was the rationale for that the low percentage because some of the things we were just never going to do within a 24-hour turnaround time and that's what we had for some of those things so say you've got someone who complains about a um a pothole on a road now if we were coming along a month later and resurfacing that road we wouldn't go in and fall in the pothole now what that might have shown on hybris is that we failed our level of service because we have a 48 hour turnaround time for potholes or something like that but but you know that was a deliberate fail if if for one of a better description because we wouldn't want to do something twice so now hybris better reflects what our turnaround times are and what's in our contracts level of circa 80 it's not as good as we'd like it to be but it's a significant improvement on what it was previously I think the challenge for us this year is that you know in transport we get 30 36 odd thousand hybris tickets a year this year that the trend in numbers seems to be higher than what we've had in previous years so you know it's it's it's we're struggling to keep up with the demand for them so just I mean I just wanted to acknowledge the um the the um the team that do the water supply the reporting that we got eventually in the memo was excellent and it gave a really good breakdown around um the response times and where we were were failing and what we were delivering on and I thought actually that's quite good I wonder if we can get something similar for transport because it is quite hard just to look at this and kind of understand but I think it was really really good from the water supply the problem here's the ones that we're currently meeting the target for the urgent um here's the ones that are overdue and here's the process to get caught up yeah this is just a high very high level snapshot obviously there's a lot of detail that sits underneath that but if you want me prepare a memo which better outlines the kind of the the trends and we have all that data really available so um and we can graph it up for you and would it show key areas where we're not meeting our target versus the ones that we are like yeah yeah we can certainly do that and it's not specific to a um some of it's locational so it's geographic as well so it's just but but anyway we can come back to you right there and then I guess related to that is what's the remedial plan like we're being overwhelmed with demand um are you seeking extra budget I know and furthering our report there's actually an underspend because we've can we get a clear remedial action and cost if we want to catch up to the target or maybe we don't but we can provide you with an update on um what we've where we've been at in previous years and where we're at this year and how we intend to address it so it's not necessarily just a matter of chucking additional resources we can be more efficient in terms of how we do things um in terms of the road maintenance contract and and the underspending there that's that's a a separate issue to the one you're raising here which is around hybris tickets so I'd be happy to speak to that if you want me to or if that's another question all right thank you now I've got um jimmy and then mike jimmy first on page 24 regarding to the water supply I just don't know how to measure you know loss of percentage because in here you emphasize the urban rate resistance supply those percentage target 99.8 but h2 is zero but a zero so I don't know because work on the way we confirm those three secure ball criteria one you're down there 20 and 60 percent so I i don't know how to evade you at least one oh you're just one per perfect one country nine zero but you still have progress right I don't know and and also whether each criteria have any time frame or milestone to follow up so helen I might get you to come to the table to answer that particular set of questions on uh page 24. thank you so and in short until we've met each of those three three criteria 100 we cannot get protozoal sign off so making progress doesn't doesn't mean you can you can have half sign off you've either completed or you or you haven't oh so that's a criteria but how about criteria too because you have under you know the criteria criteria yeah several several temperaments below guang what's a target that can fix it criteria two we have completed in terms of so the the other ones that we're doing um are the temporary below ground ones which can be raised up and some replacement wells so we're complete on criteria too and criterion three similarly we meet that within the city but until we complete criterion one complete that work to the satisfaction of the drinking water assessor we cannot get signed off okay okay thank you second question on page 31 31 is regarding the packs and the for sure the target is a hundred percent customer service request but actually it's a 66th percentage I just want to know regarding to the community parks the presentation a moment not yet down am I right when when this will be you know and will be the happen I'm sorry I can't I can't speak to the parks csrs in any detail jimmy I'll have to work with andrew rutledge to come back to you with a reply on that okay thank you so can you come back to us on that one that'll be fine jimmy thank you mike thank you I from a previous counsellor about a civilized pedestrian crossing on maine north road so I just wonder if I could ask richard a question on on that to actually clarify thanks richard I guess the comment was that we've put in a crossing that stops buses that crossing is actually at the super stop where buses stop and it's there to allow the bus users to actually cross the road safely is that correct that's correct it provides legibility between incoming and outgoing buses thank you all right are there any further questions all right so I'm happy to um move what are now two resolutions in front of us to receive the information provided in the report and then to remove the level of service that we discussed earlier I'm happy to move those do I have a second or jimmy chen all those is there any debate on this all those in favor say aye against that's carried okay so then moving on to the next item item eight the capital project performance report so ruth welcome to the table thank you introductory remarks first of all then we'll move to questions thank you did you hear me do you want me to repeat myself okay cool so I'll make some general comments on the content of the report got the delivery unit leads in the room to answer any specific questions you will notice that there has been a slight change in the project names within the report and this will be ongoing they won't change any further but we have done a complete review of our project names changing our naming convention so that they are a little bit more understood by our citizens as well as internally so those project names will be reflected in the long-term plan and in our long-term plan tool so in terms of the content of the report our financial year position since last report to the committee external funding from our shovel ready projects and our water reform has been added to the financial year budget so that has increased our financial year budget from 513 million which we reported in november at 552 million in terms of our forecasts from the external funded and to the multi-use in the metro this just ensures that we can continue to provide a good view on how we're tracking to deliver on the core program and that's our core commitments from the financial year 21 annual plan so against the core program of 375 mil project managers are forecasting 398.5 against the external funded six six of six six point nine uh forecasting a spend of 53.6 across the whole program we're looking to see an overall carry forward of 35.7 million based on the data from our project managers you'll see that there's a detailed carry forward and bring back information on page 49 to 53. so forecasts to the end of financial year you will see from pages 45 to 48 there's some pretty decent forecasts coming up in the months ahead uh there are specific commentary in relation to the kind of key drivers that are pushing those monthly forecasts to that level so I'm going to make some general comments on the current position that we're in in order to queries in relation to the delivery programs then I'll be deferring to the delivery heads so in terms of general comments spin to date at december was 193.5 this is an improved position at the same time last year of 188. so with an out turn last year 380 despite covert we're on track to deliver a similar or a better result to validate that we have 243 projects in construction at the moment forecasting 299 and that compares to last year of 225 forecasting 237. so from that original forecast of 237 last year despite covered we still delivered 190 our core program is forecasting a bring back of 9.5 so that's also a very unique situation from previous years usually by this point we're forecasting a pretty reasonable carry forward so that means we are in an improved position to accommodate any unforeseen issues within that program that may occur in the remaining months so to the end our core program remains focused on delivering to that 375 and finally our forecast accuracy so in the last 12 rolling months we have been around committee report we had paid out 72 we're now sitting at 93 um of all claims and interim and final costs having been paid out so we are at the end of the negotiations uh with only four claims left to be resolved I will now take any questions thank you um so thanks for the um update obviously that bring back of 9.9 or 9.5 that's something that we'll be keeping an eye on over the next few months deliverability of um 50 million a month or in excess of 50 million a month for the rest of the financial year um have you got a high level of confidence in that been able to be delivered it seems quite ambitious just keen to get some further commentary around that yeah definitely so it is ambitious when you compare it to previous years but in terms of the position we are with projects in construction we're doing better than we have in previous years as well there are three kind of delivery units that are driving those forecasts and so I thought it would be um so transport are forecasting 55 three waters are forecasting 75 and major facilities 40. so I think it'd be good maybe richard lynette if transport then three waters and facilities could kind of speak to how they've got their program set up to deliver on the current forecasts yeah because certainly that 50 um or 50 plus does seem ambitious but you know if we've got a high level of confidence around that and that's excellent um from transport's perspective we do in the sense that we have a large number of works and train and they are contracted so uh the bulk valves sit either with major cycleways that are shut already funded um and we've got currently about five or six contracts running um on top of that we've got our maintenance contracts and other big uh contracts like martians road bridge dyer's pass barriers so this is a number of really big contracts out there so we are confident that it's a realistic and pragmatic estimate of what we're going to spend excellent thank you it 70 million dollars out in the out in the market being evaluated or in tender we've got about 15 million dollars in land purchase being lined up for expended to this financial year and we're also in delivery of a significant program in our stormwater area right as we speak as this is our delivery period in the in the drier period so it's looking pretty good we've had some savings which have suppressed a bit of what appears to be spend and that is being redirected to next year's renewals and renewals of lead jointed pipes so in that space I think that the three waters delivery is pretty much as described in the reports so you're confident that the um contribution to the 50 million or thereabouts a month that we're looking at coming from three waters you're confident that that is deliverable as planned yes I am thank you excellent thank you very much and then finally facilities I'll see so the three projects in particular are um one is a a bring back which is to uh money uh the two other projects are cmua and metro sports facility metro sports facility being the larger of the two and that's regarding the forecast that's been presented to us by otakura and from a council perspective we monitor that every month um and we pay against the invoices that come in but again their forecast is compounded by the carving 19 issues and their program issues they won't um provide a reforecast until their financial year end is completed with regards to cmua cmui are predicted sums that were in indicative forecasts that were given to us right at the very early days we're uh we're now in a conclusion of an rfp which is in negotiation uh with a with a preferred tenderer and it's a due process that we're going through and once we're through that process we'll have a revised forecast which will inform the next year's spend profile all right so I think a key point there is that the um metroid sports facility given that it's not a project that we're're relying on information that's provided to us um obviously you're getting those monthly updates and you're feeding those into what we see um yeah it's it's worth um pointing that out because of course that's not a project which has been delivered by council and and uh john bridgeman did attend council at the last meeting to uh to outline where they were at correct all right thank you um ruth I think it's been incredibly helpful having unit managers come in front of us to to provide that level of confidence um you know it's great that you're providing figures in a report at a high level but I think you know particularly at this stage in the year it's good for us to hear that level of confidence coming from unit managers that in turn can give us a level of confidence that whilst these numbers are ambitions they are actually deliverable so thank you for um setting it up that way was there anything else that you wanted to say before we moved to questions I's agreement um the way that the deliverability commentary by month is currently provided in the report could be split out by delivery units so that you can see the contribution each delivery unit is making to that month given the comments I just made I think that would be really helpful thank you right so now moving to questions aaron yeah um a couple ruth one is um under some of the risks when we have oh sorry page 57 under exchange rate uh you know any hike in the us dollar may impact project costs at present this is not impacting project costs but has the potential to do so but can go the other way as well which it has since the election the um us dollars weakened considerably so we're about 10 cents better off now does that factor in that way do we get it do we get a win or did all the suppliers just go no no no when we locked in the contract the dollar was that so we'll do that but when it goes the other way they'll the detail of the costs that we get on each specific project so that would probably be a question for delivery units yeah because it's just highlighted for going when the dollar goes north but when it goes south which it has done since the election thank goodness um oh um is that something that you can I can write a comment to you but I can't necessarily answer the detail of the question um when we set up our contracts it does depend on how those contracts are set up so if it is dependent on fluctuating if materials are dependent on fluctuating exchange rates and we take that risk then we take the risk either way also we do get a win sometimes yep cool um that's good to hear and then the other one is on the contracts um and the claims that were being made um as last year panned out in the end a number of companies that had put in wage subsidy claims end up paying back because their end of year results were a lot better than expected in fact covert and those come any of those companies that have paid back the wage subsidy still putting a claim into the council we haven't recently because they've had a really good year we haven't received any new claims in any of the any withdrawn that claims that we have the contractual claims that we have paid out on have been under the conditions of the contract so they have been for materials of works done that weren't included or that weren't considered because um so they're a variation to the contract so the claims that we have made have been under the terms and conditions of the contract and under contract law the how the companies run their businesses their business and we haven't got into that that is not what we've done in these claims yeah yeah so I mean contracts all written pre-covered obviously and then covert comes around which makes for a very different year so yes they can claim because of time loss and things like that so yep they put in well they actually had to do intend having to do at the start of the contract right so we have to pay for that so for example when we knew we were going into lockdown and we had our contractors up on cranford street we asked them to close the site and get rid of the cones so that the people living on that street weren't living in amongst a work site for four six eight weeks so they put extra ash felt down that they didn't have you know they closed up pits they didn't intend to have to do so they did work that they didn't intend to have to do and we have to pay for that yeah yeah and that's it and that's what our claims have been also the only that's what our private claims are brilliant so there's none for I can't I can't answer that definitively and it's not a question I would ask of the biz that's that's how they run their business our claims are under our contract for items that they have done yeah all right thank you jimmy I have two questions first one on page 62. uh regarding to the uh one or watch the list the host will junction your extension particularly here the risk you know mitigate I just want to know uh regarding the key where program works you know all those kind of real closing potential land contamination my question concerns because this forecast delivered date will be in may of 2020 to only one year plus whether it is under control or out of control this risk it's definitely under control no you problem question is on 65 the south expressed a particular stage one from temperature to the high high low those ones we enter into a detailed design by the community their particular concern the particular traffic petition work with the accept issue staff particular mentioned web will be you know the presenter to the company ball and also the wider community in february first question is whether these the concern has been reflected to our digital design second is now my understanding february didn't happen whether it postponed too much or community concerns have been taken into consideration we are having continuing discussions with the community and the community group as you're aware um about the concerns along waterloo road and others as part of that we have brought forward the construction of the as at hornby primary the this the crossing outside hornby primary on high high road so that is going to be delivered early ahead of the delivery of the rest of the of the cycleway in that area south express cycleway has currently has three contracts underway another one in tinder and another one due to tinder in a couple of months so we're getting out towards high high road now we've always been building it from the city out we are having continuing discussions with the residence group as I said and we have a briefing with the community board with all of the community board um on the night I think it had to get delayed to the 9th of march but that is to take into account all the concerns that are being raised in that area staff are also looking so that will all be discussed at the briefing thank you um jimmy just on the keyway real matter um that you raised in the first question um I raised with um minister grant robertson exactly that issue as an example of a number of issues that are happening around the country at the moment he's very aware um obviously the governments have got a um a focus on mode shift and and climate change issues um he's very aware of that issue um so it's been picked up at that level as well so through the chair we've seen benefit of that conversation thank you very much excellent it's good to know that a joined up approach is working excellent one of our related programs and also the it's kind of severe the delay for several years you know community and the basic practical concerning this project yep so we've got progress that's good um pauline thank you I've just got a question on um page 60 I think about the saint organs community centre um can you explain notes actual state so approved and forecast is 3.9 million and then what does that mean I always thought it was 3.2 um the total life-to-date budget since inception is 3.9 um sorry can you say that again the total life to date budget all of start to finish is 3.9 and that's what we're forecasting to here that's what ruth's report shows us oh this was under the impression it was 3.2 so um and it it's nearly finished yeah great news the team are on site at the moment um we're looking to issue practical completion within the next 10 days which gives us a clear month out till the opening on the two are we going to come in under the 3.9 we're going to come in this will be a successful project delivered under budget okay that's great for me to hear because there's a couple of things that we need there and one of them one of them is really really important it's the actual name on the side of the building I've bought a it's not going to cost very much to do no I'm no good at doing signs so my understanding is that richie moyle who's the project manager is attending the community board next week he is looking at options in relation to the name of the name and what is the design of the particular name that is well the news to date in all fairness is the feedback we've had at the board is that there's no budget for a sign on the building there's a sign for a freestanding sign funding for freestanding side outside um and the quote that they've had is twelve thousand dollars to put a name on the building so the important thing to add though is the sign was originally in the design you have taken off to reduce the the cost of that building so we're actually under budget that should be reinstated so can we take that offline from this meeting um but can we make sure it's taken away in a way that it's going to be handled and dealt wonderful job there but sometimes I get the feeling that his hands are tied when it comes to budget allowances and he's really trying to stick to the 3.2 but for me a sign and a good sign on the building we have um unofficially decided we've been gifted a maori name as well um is really really key it's an amazing looking building and it would be such a shame to have it let down without a really good uh naming on the side of it all and I'm very happy to talk to you so let's take that offline but let's see whether we can get to an ideal outcome which is a project that still comes in on the budget but with a sign attached to the outside of the building so is there any chance that we could get the accessibility ramp off the deck then at the same time can we take this conversation offline there are clearly a number of features which are going to be applicable just the two things all right that's fine now I just um just thinking of the residence in oldport place um around the littleton harbour wastewater scheme I mean that street has basically since the earthquake had works in it that project's now looking like it's delayed again um there seems to be a whole bunch of issues with it is there anything that we can do to address it if it's delayed can we make it look nice and a bit like what we heard before or can we get good communication to those residents about what's actually going on there had been a delay with the delivery of this bespoke valve for that position and they were undertaking some work on the valve pit which was expected to be completed around about now and we were going to disestablish and tidy it up communicate with the residents and then come back in two months time when we expected that valve to arrive from overseas so it should all be tidied up now very soon yes right and has there been a notice go to explain what's going on yep they're talking to stuff like normally at a community level we'd get a start work notice on things but I mean I've gone back through yeah I i guess in that space um because it's work in progress there hasn't been um any further start work notices because it's actually started right okay I mean it's just quite common that we would get like an update when if things are delayed or you know so anyway I'll just speed that back but it's good to hear that um that's that's on track um I just um wanted to thank staff for organising a site visit to the churn street brick barrel I just thought it was actually it's actually really good when you get an opportunity to see firsthand what some of the issues are particularly with projects that are that are red so I just wanted to acknowledge that and say that um you know if there were opportunities going forward I think it's really valuable to hear firsthand um when you see it you can actually understand why things specific interest in a project we would invite you to come and talk to us and we'd be very happy to show you around any of them um I just said there was another one here that had the levels wrong um and I was just sorry I just can't quite find it but it said that we were having to go back because the levels were wrong in terms of the the work that was done um so yeah I was just concerned about that I'm sorry I just can't just looking through should we come back to you yoni once you've found that yeah I had another question about the um the the arena um sorry the metro sports facility it says delays are due to slower progress than current construction program um construction program currently being reviewed by contractor and otakuro uh like have we got any idea what's happening there why it's delayed what the problem is I mean this has been something that's been raised repeatedly yeah we've sort of been reassured that it's been something's going wrong I think we can't um I can't talk directly to how the project managing that project um we're obviously cognizant that there's been a great deal of work uh occurred over the last few months certainly within the structural steel and the cladding and they're showing great progress there's no doubt and but there'll be a massive catch-up that they're in the process of doing um they can make big headways into structural steel programs and erection of steel and cladding for the exteriors in the pools but they are ultimately in delay and they are um working through that progress and it's a it is a contractual uh discussion that otakura will be having with cpv as the main contractor and today they're indicating that there's a there's a possibility of time being pulled back but you can see from the spend forecast that that's not actually occurring so it's a pretty obvious point that they are going to be in delay we're just waiting for them to confirm what of it yeah a year no we can't tell I can't tell you that because I can't tell you what their program of work is they have not updated the program they've not come back to us because they're in contractual discussions with cpp so but it's obvious from the spend forecast that they're in delay because you need to meet a dollar spent in order to get to where you've got to go to all right okay if we wanted a fuller update an idea might be to get um john john bridgeman back at some point either to the next iteration of this meeting so mark noon yes so through the chair sorry mark noonan represents council's interest from uh the management of the contract from our side uh so I'll talk to mark when he's back at work and we'll discuss getting john and their financial team in the room to discuss how they're gonna how they're going with progress and how they're going with the contractual client yeah clearly it's well be that things have moved on or we've got more certainty within the next month before the next meeting but it will be good to get an update um so that we know exactly where we're at just on page 59 I just had um three questions um hereford street bridge surface replacement it says there's a forecast overspend to signal pole relocations and the project manager is currently reviewing budgets in order to confirm final cost um there was also some discussion around the bollards as well so um it's not mentioned in that specific one I think was mentioned in a different one so I'm just kind of curious when we um what's the pro the change process for hereford straight if there's significant extra cost because I guess with the bollards I wasn't really happy the way that that process the cost seemed to go up quite considerably and I don't think we had good visibility of that so are we going to get a report to council um any changes as a result of contractual requirements as per the grade financial delegations that we work with them so all council decision making on that project is complete everything that remains to be done is either within the project or within staff delegation is that correct and if it's not it will be reported back to council so the so choosing the cost of the bollards based on the terror risk like I don't recall us ever getting a report saying here's the options simply money was added and the budget was increased considerably the discussion was had at the annual plan session so that that that my understanding is the bollards um the discussion was had at the annual plan last annual plan there was an increase in the line item but there was no specific report that said you know based on the terror threat where we're spending there was brief things to end discussions with the um appropriate committee about that one from memory there were two briefings um from a decision-making point of view the whole the whole match is within staff delegation but um elected members were given which has then um influenced the way that staff have exercised their um ability to um delegate that's exactly right and um and the changes in budget were brought through the annual plan process yeah okay um I just find it weird like you know saint albans can't_''_5102.0 get twelve thousand dollars for a sign gets taken off and they're struggling and we've got significant okay can we stick to questions thank you um the uh the other question was in the um in source firefield lewis and main renewal wastewater the contract is complete her additional stage is now required 80 metres upstream to correct a level discrepancy and replace poor condition pipes so I was just trying to check why that wasn't picked up at the start of the project there was a survey error and when they came to connect to the manhole they found that the pipe didn't match at the appropriate level so the resolution to that was to extend the laying of the pipe and bring forward the replacement of another section of pipe which was going to be like a close-out report that that determines how that could occur because it seems pretty basic um it was a survey error by one of our consultants um we could talk to them about their professional indemnity but the loss to the council is effectively nil because it was pipe that was going to be replaced anyway all right okay um and the final question I had was on the um just on the top one the water supply react of water meter renewal additional budget required to fund water meter replacement so fy21 a change request of 2.9 million has been submitted I know we've also got a smart water smart meter water smart water meter program as well um and I think I'm just trying to understand at what point do we make the call to go to a smart meter technology rather than bring forward money to do that existing replacement so we are going to run a trial of smart meters out in the rafferty zone and following that trial we will look at the roll out across the city however the meters dumb meters can be upgraded by putting the smarts on top so we won't be closing off any options by putting those meters in but there'd be a huge additional cost to retrofitting and making no there would be a very small additional cost so you just pop them on top so it won't cost a lot that's correct yep and the um the reactive water meter replacement program is to address the leaks at the tobi boxes that are being reported around the city so um instead of doing uh repairs on those toby boxes where the meters uh quite elderly we're replacing the whole meter assembly and that means that we don't come back two or three times and we're also improving the backflow prevention at those sites so what's the cost of just putting in a replacement meter as we're doing now versus putting in a smart meter versus coming back and putting a smart thing on at a later date I have to come back to you with those precise costs okay thank you all right so james sarah I understand I can take mine offline to save time all right thank you aaron yeah mime's just around the um synovium's uh community center is that um approximately uh 400 meters square meters is that the size or is it bigger it is approximately 400 square meters and is that price the three nine is that the build cost or was that including the land purchase that's everything required from start to finish to deliver the project it's not the construction cost it's not the land cost it includes a number of things the purchase of 130 caledonian road um staff time resource consent everything you need to deliver the project so so not that so if you're trying to if you get if you're I'm preempting a question about square meter costs potentially yeah you're like you do have most projects like if I was going to buy a house so when the qs bottoms are out we've got an external as we do on all our jobs a professional consultancy running the numbers on us square metre cost thank you yep if we can get that just by way of a memo or an email that'd be perfect thank you yeah yeah well you take off the land costs and then every other looking at the build costs for the actual box yep so if you can provide the cost and the basis on which you've arrived at it that would be excellent thank you okay um james actually my questions of um through you ruth to helen is that possible so helen if we can um bring you back to the table so I'm guessing this is on a water matter sorry I didn't realize that she was leaving now that's all right no problem it's good that we've got the right people in the room for all these questions just quickly about the smart meter trial in the rafiti zone um what what was the reason for using that area that that zone has recently been disconnected from the central zone if you like and we chose that because it's got a number of new enough zone to test the technology and we um yeah we just regard that as the best spot for it I like the answer but I just want to check that doesn't that wouldn't mean that that zone would be the first to pay excess water charges no it won't make any difference we can advance that if you wish we could use that that was a statement not a question okay all right thank you all right so are there any more questions on this um capital project performance report okay so I'm happy to move this do I have a seconder um aaron is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you now moving on to item nine the water services bill draft submission now this has been the subject of a couple of briefings there's been quite a bit of work done in the background in preparing this submission and there may well be some matters raised today that requires some further changes to be made in which case delegating sign off probably will be you want to make some introductory remarks on this just I'll try to be brief um as you know the water services bill is the second in a series of pieces of legislation um as part of the government's three water reform program the first one was um enacting tomato arrow by water services regulator act um in the middle of last year which established talmud arawa as the water services regulator but a second bill was needed which is this one the water services bill which lays out the rules and responsibilities of tamata around as well as roles and responsibilities of drinking water suppliers and in addition to local authorities the bill is largely focused on drinking water there are some provisions for wastewater and storm water but mostly surround drinking water there are some differences between what the bill has in it and what the health act which deals with drinking water has in it while the both the health act and the bill talk about drinking water suppliers having to do drinking water safety plans there's a new provision in the bill that for residual disinfection in their drinking water safety plans unless an exemption has been granted by tamata arawai it's not clear from the way the bill is written whether those exemptions could be sought and granted for drinking water supplies like ours that don't already have residual disinfection so one of the big differences between the current situation under the health act and what the bill provides for is that the scope of the drinking water suppliers who are subject to to the legislation under the current situation under the health act drinking water suppliers that serve 25 people or more 60 or more days a year fall under the provisions of the health act if you've got less than that then you don't the bill the water services bill changes that and basically would apply to any drinking water supplier other than a residential self-supplier so in other words if you've got your own rain water tank or your own bore and you don't supply anybody else that's a soft supplier but any any other type of drinking water supply would be the bill also makes some amendments to the local government act which includes provisions that would that could require terrorist territorial authorities to take over private supplies that are or could be at risk of failing to meet drinking water requirements um the draft submission itself the way it's currently structured is sort of in two parts the first part focuses on key areas of concern right now that's two areas one is the requirement for residual disinfection of reticulated drinking water supplies and the second is source water protection and treatment the draft submission with regard to residual disinfection points out that it is possible for drinking water supplies to be demonstratively safe without residual treatment and the submission also raises concerns about the uncertainty over how exemptions to residual treatment will be granted and the process of seeking redress if a drinking water supplier wishes to challenge the decision of the regulator as right now the regulator the way the bill is written the regulator can grant or not an exemption to residual disinfection um has it on grounds that it pleases so it's there water protection the requirement for physical treatment of source water the draft submission points out that source water risk management plans and drinking water safety plans can provide a multi-barrier approach and this mission also talks about the fact that combined confined aquifers naturally provide for removal of particles and pathogens and the submission is also seeking in terms of source water protection to um do more to protect sources of drinking water as there's gaps that aren't really addressed in the bill about that and instruments such as the national policy statement for fresh water management really don't deal very well with groundwater and protection of groundwater the submission also has in the second part a number of recommendations on more technical matters one of them has to do with the again the amendment to the local government act um having to do with territorial authorities having to take over failing private drinking water suppliers and I think I'll I'll stop there and open it up for questions thank you so are there any questions on this liane I'm happy to move it do you think there should be a differentiation in between um surface water suppliers and groundwater supplies um I think it would my answer would be it depends oh they're super dope it depends on the source yeah um there I think there's some pretty obvious differences that in general um it would be hard to find a service water supply that doesn't have um a fairly high probability of being subject to contamination of one sword or another just because it's open to the the environment um whereas groundwater um is naturally protected because it isn't yes but I mean there's certainly some and then there's groundwater and groundwater and ours is particularly pressurized yes yes okay thank you any further questions on this all right so leanne you've indicated you're happy to move this sarah you've indicated you're happy to second so moved by the mayor seconded by um delegate the the chair and mayor the authority to sign the final submission yep so that allows for any um changes to be made just to finalize this to make this submission I don't mind if if anyone else wants to um do that as well so number four just to be represented by the mayor and supported by appropriate staff yep excellence all right so that's been moved and seconded is there any debate all right so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you all right now um we might at this point take our morning tea break um a little bit early it's um 10 to 11 if we just take a 10 minute break um and we've got the people from the christchurch foundation coming here at 11 o'clock so we'll come back at 11 to do the christchurch foundation paper and then after that continue with the rest of the agenda so let's now adjourn the meeting um I'll adjourn the meeting until 11 o'clock thank you we will move to item 20 because we've david we've already done the resolution to include the supplementary segment yeah yeah perfect okay um well thanks they're conflicted on this one so I won't be participating except leanne's going to sit at the end of the table with humphrey and amy if there are questions for the foundation so that's a decision yep land's made um so what we could do is then do you guys so lynn and linda do you want to talk through your report what we might then do is I mean if humphrey and amy and liam want to come and add something to it and then we can just go through questions so what I guess the way we'll play it out is if the factual question's on the report um you know we'll talk through the offices or you know the staff through that but if it's more around some of the issues that you guys can't answer then I think it's appropriate that amy and humphrey um can answer those so do you want to walk us through the report yes thank you chair the morning everybody the report we've provided is came from the about agreement um the foundation's been in existence for three years deloitte was a commission to undertake the work the um we've supplemented the work that's done by deloitte to do a bit more additional benchmarking and the report has been we've tabled is we believe a balanced report which provides there are questions and probably as you say the foundation would may be best to answer those directly but it will answer any questions on the quality of the information that's in the report so we'll just leave it up to the committee sure so do we want to do you want to go through I wonder if it's useful before you are we go to questions amy and humphrey do you and liam if you want to do you want to just maybe give us a quick update and then we just open it for questions for everyone I think that's it's going to be it's going to be easier yeah we'll see we get the whole picture before we delve into questions good morning everyone thank you and then very happy to take any questions from councillors so just the christchurch foundation first of all is owned by the people of canterbury the christchurch foundation chairman is owned by the people of canterbury they are who is chairman I look to to to do my reporting the christchurch city council has generously decided in its wisdom to support philanthropy and the most practical way you guys have elected to do that is by giving an annual grant to the christchurch foundation that annual grant started at 600 000 per annum it's now running at 540 000 per annum and it is my wish as the chair of the foundation to reduce that further by the end of the six-year period we have given you extensive reporting and to your council staff extensive reporting we are in an order we are audited by two parties two professional parties and we have responded to and supported the review that the council wished to make and was built into the document on day one we in fact built it in for you that it could that you had the wish to share with you that deloitte and wellington I i didn't meet the people um but we came in by voice they had a brief from the council and that's your brief it's not ours that that brief is it says what it says uh in my view it was uh uh it wasn't_''_7146.56 a very strange brief um but that's your that's your issue not mine um and I did ask the deloitte people in wellington uh what experience they have in reviewing foundations because we're a new phenomenon in new zealand it's only over the last 15 years or so that or 20 years that foundations have got going deloitte's answer to me and I think counselors should know this is that they had not reviewed a foundation before so I thought okay we'll give you some help here so I personally answered every query that was raised under your brief not mine to assist deloitte my chief executive did the same and we gave them full access to our auditors and our accountants full access the that pertains to our commercial clients who support the foundation and philanthropy in our city it's none of the right's business there was no conclusion they could draw from it except to say haven't you done well um so that's that's the background and we're very happy to to answer questions and we do think I suppose as a fundamental thing chair we do think that the comparative exercise is flawed and amy will detail you in a very simple manner why that is flawed and maybe that would be quite a good first question to us because the media seem to be wanting to compare cents per employee or some crazy ratio which is completely irrelevant and I have had other chairs of and and trustees of foundations around new zealand saying don't these people understand that every foundation in new zealand is different and what you have with us is a completely different foundation that operates in auckland and in dunedin and interestingly enough uh one thing we we take increasing pride in is that foundations around the world are reaching uh uh um um uh assistance requirements which we provided under your request uh backed up by the prime minister for the mosque massacres so we're a very efficient tool for the people of canterbury to own and support and my judgment is that that support is rolling in increasingly month on month not necessarily in dollars but an understanding of what we stand for and what we are doing and how we are networking connecting and finally we are donor centric we love our donors and we help them we are not so interested in the causes because that looks after itself thank you um just to give you a cost comparison so and uh I understand the intent and the need to want to compare us to understand value for money of your investment it's a good one but to remove the income that we generated to support the victims of march 15 and to keep the costs we incurred and that meant that the figures were a little skewed and I'd just like to talk you through that remembering that we were established on need here in otautahi that wasn't filled when the earthquakes happened which was to help those people that love our city and it surrounds to give to our recovery and a part of our establishment that this organization has set up was that we were to respond in times of crisis and on the day of the shootings I received a call from leanne at 10 o'clock at night asking us to set that up we set up an entire gifting platform overnight at no expense additional expense to the council and then began what is the most complex funds gathering and distribution process that has ever been run in new zealand and I've had that said to me from my peers across new zealand who have run and support over the last two days so if we do add back in the funds generated for march 15. that means to the end of last financial year we had raised 12.6 million dollars for this city and its people our total opex costs in that time were 1.8 million and that brings down our optics cost per more efficient than what was in the report and that would be the one thing I'd really like to ensure that you understand that swallowed us whole for a year and a half when you talk to raph and I we will both tell you that's the hardest thing we've ever done professionally it was thousands of hours and the other unintention consequence of this process is I've received phone calls over the last two days from members of that community that now think you don't care because you removed it out of that calculation and that is devastating but moving on since the end of that last financial year we've raised an additional 2.94 million to date for our city which brings us to a grand total of 15.9 million over that period of time I also want you to understand that your contribution to us if we continue at the existing funding reduced funding levels that we requested a reduction in funding from you of 540 your total investment in us till the end of the six year period and our establishment've already distributed back to you is 2.5 million meaning that your annual investment to establish the christchurch foundation a legacy for the city that will last for generations is 150 000 a year and I've got two more years to maybe generate some more revenue for you so that's the situation that we're in and I thank you for the opportunity to talk you through that great thank you amy for that um leanna you going to add anything or no I confirm what amy said from the outset christchurch didn't have a foundation at the time of the earthquakes the prime minister had to step in and set up a prime minister's fund the mayor of the day set up a mayor's fund in fact when I became the mayor in 2013 there was a small amount left in the in the kitty as it were uh from the and then uh in the cost-sharing agreement there was provision for philanthropic contributions there were none to be obtained the issue was brought to the council and it was left to us to of the the community foundation a place-based uh giving organization which has been established in new zealand since about 2003 so what humphrey has said is right this is a relatively new model of place-based giving we did look at the rata foundation as an existing organisation but they can't fundraise they can't gather new money they can't accept bequests they simply distribute that which has been already provided to them so we did look at other options this has been an exceptional organisation I never imagined for one minute that I would be in a position to call on the foundation to establish a fund in the wake of a massacre in the city but I was able to make that phone call at 10 o'clock in the evening I thought it might have even been slightly later than that as the as the amount of um money that was coming in through the victim support platform the give a little page uh was just mounting and mounting and mounting and that was not a sustainable model as it proved to be this model proved been in the role for a relatively short period of time had won the confidence of the department of prime minister and cabinet and had the prime minister's support for the platform our people our city fund and I was enormously proud the last thing that I wanted to say was that I've sat around the foundation board table as a trustee and I do so with incredible pride and gratitude for every single trustee that sits around that table and hasn't taken one cent in fees since it was established the people have come on board because they believe in leaving a legacy for the earthquakes for the moss shootings for any challenge that comes our way and then with some of the initiatives which you're all well aware of some of the initiatives that are not about a financial contribution but a legacy project for example the tui corridor I've just mentioned yeah I'm just conscious of time yeah but I just wanted to say that with the with this this is the legacy for thank you city cool thank you um join at the table so that we can then direct the questions as you said initially either to the foundation or to relevant staff okay so does anybody have any questions initially would okay so jake first and then um so one I've got about three questions one that's just come out of what's been presented the costs in terms of distributing that money and I will use the word distribute that money because there's money that would have come in any way um I'm thinking particularly of refs fees what was that from your normal operations budget or was that funded elsewhere yes it was from within our operations budget but we also received a hundred thousand dollars from the government to help pay ref to do our ongoing support of that community as well so did it okay right okay um and in terms of the documents you haven't handed over a few documents why not the conflict of of interest jim and I did answer that oh I'll be kind of going to collaborate are there confidential information for commercial no the conflict of interest yeah register we manage conflicts perfectly well I spent my whole life managing conflicts yeah that's humphrey that's fine but it was a request that's one of the concerns raised yeah so yeah we just can't understand why it wasn't provided that are you dreaming about conflicts of interest they want to see a conflict of this register yeah related to any time oh well they can hit you not a problem yeah no I wasn't aware they actually want to see one I thought they thought we had one so did oh I'm sure you'd have one I'm sure you're very capable of managing it because you'd like to see it would be great oh yeah no no absolutely yeah not a problem um yeah I think I had one more oh can you tell me more about your you know your the potential future options you see around self-funding it seemed to me that the idea was to essentially split the existing cost amongst a larger number of councils could I start learned one thing from the review mr chairman and that was that the auckland city council gave an annual grant to their foundation of 250 000 I thought you might all be interested in that I think that that really is a sensible benchmark and uh if we ended up in that position I think that would be a very good outcome we've always had the intent of establishing a fifa service model jake and we've been working towards that we've got a number of corporate partners already that are providing that so it wouldn't just be local government that would be seeking that relationship with corporates as well so for example meridian already gives us a hundred thousand dollars per annum towards our operational overheads and it's because of that generosity we could come back to you guys and ask for less money ann do you want to go through yours both of my questions have been answered thank you okay just just one on that um conflict and then we can move through on that conflicts of interest register so I mean obviously it was sort of signed off so our understanding was you had a chance to review it uh humphrey yeah yeah because it just says like in the appendix four it says that that wasn't provided I just wondered whether we'd looked at it it was probably an oversight on my behalf and I apologize for that we're in the middle of our audit at the same time that this review was underway as well as trying to write annual reports and in the middle of doing mop up and financial year for our legal requirements for the charities office I may have missed that right we're quite happy to share that okay would that is it on your website or anything no it's not our website but it's in our minutes every day and I'm very happy to share that with all of you okay cool thank you any other questions jani thank you do you want questions of staff now as well I think the best thing is just ask what question you've got and then they can determine who okay so I just was interested um and I i couldn't quite tell from the response we've had back in regards to the support agreement the annual request can you just advise what years the annual requests have been made in terms of the foundation so what years did they submit the annual budget request and what's the record of us approving up to six hundred thousand dollars that we have so we're in our fourth year currently financial year of funding from you of those four years only two years we've drawn down the full six hundred thousand uh there was 580 I think in the first year and a half it wasn't a one year it was a year and a half period and this year we did 540. sorry my question really was to staff what year have they received the proposed annual budget and what record is there of approving or seeking further information from the foundation um as part of that consideration so we've had two budgets from them uh 2021 and 1920 the reports came up to them or noted them and I sent you that uh the resolution and the paper yesterday in response to your request I sent it for the ce's office so we've had the annual report and we have had the one the one the one report the financial um information but in terms of the two years prior we did provide them to you but it was to a staff member that's not here now right I can't talk for what happened before I came into it but there seemed to be some accepted acceptance of the view that because the money was the funding was in the ltp that it was approved and I think that's that that's what had happened in those earlier two years and I think um and that's been rectified now so the foundation did submit the annual proposed budget and we just yeah we didn't_''_8150.8 I have certainly haven't seen them and don't have them and the person that did presumably receive them is no longer here do we know and it's a bit they go through look at and look at the annual proposed budget they didn't ask me well uh it was part of the information they were given okay so can we get a copy of what the annual price budgets were from those four years no no look I have I've got no information on those prior to 2019 20. right if you want to see that I'm really happy to sit down with you and show you all that information I would have thought as part of the review that's quite a significant well can't give them documents that I don't have that was the foundation must have them if they've submitted them we've got them yeah we're happy to share them with you um the general ledger that one of the questions that has asked if they can see the general ledger from 2019 to 2020 and 20 from fifth july 30th has that has that been provided or why we're asked told to contact directly kpmg and pwc to receive whatever information they wanted as our accountants I am aware they didn't actually contact and ask that so mr chairman it'd be I'd be really interested to know what this review has cost you yeah I don't have that answer now but it's really it would be less than our contribution to you I'm sure but something else yeah but um anyway um just as a general observation counselor um this review which really in my view in my language turned out to be a sort of another audit which which and and the the interesting thing about this is it's really an audit over 150 000 that's the difference between salaries and wages what we're spending like I mean it's just ridiculous too sorry I don't think that's um fair that we get that sort of commentary yeah we're considering this report yeah that's okay I'm humphrey's entitled towards you but do you want to just keep going with your questions are we going to have a debate now about the ridiculousness or not the order no we've just in 3.4 um of the um report that we had it said staff endeavoured to probe the following two key questions right into budget with the foundation without success um and that was potential for achieving financial donations in the year ahead in order that some idea of value for money can be determined and the second one was whether the tree gifting and other activities that the foundation is doing that are non-financial so I'm just concerned that we do have um we have kind of had advice around um the fact that we've been unable to get answers to questions that staff have raised with the foundation and why that is so we've had several over two and a half hour sessions with deloitte explaining them to how projects like the tui corridor work sorry this is council staff this was before the delights review this was um from our finance and performance committee from 12th of august last year and the um the budget for 20 20 21. yes so following that um humphrey and amy did come in and give you a on their budget but why why were we unable to get that information ahead of we came and briefed you on this here look I think it's fair to say that we are engaging with the foundation have been engaging with them over the past 18 months or so to try and get to a point where they understand our requirements and we understand their requirements and I think we've had some progress on that and we are getting to a point where the information that we're getting is meeting our needs right so we're so in regards to the deloitte report um the information that's been sought in terms of the quarterly reporting where when no we're no longer seeking that or we are we're going to be sitting since the report's come out we're going to sit down with amy and say these are the what we think are the deficiencies within the quarterly reporting and that's mainly around um transparency on financials and transparencies on some of these on these non-financial ones however we haven't had sorry can I just be able to go back that we've had back and the email that I got back was that we had um yeah I'm happy to quote it to you but it's it says that we have um asked for that previously so we have reported uh we have asked for reporting that is akin to that recommended by deloitte with little success I'm trying to understand given that we've historically been asking for that information why we haven't had it right so we haven't had that information because uh we haven't_''_8471.359 I believe we haven't had a robust enough conversation between the two our two parties as to why that information is needed and I believe that at this point in time we're able to have that conversation are confident that we're going to be able to get more informed reporting right okay um and just I guess when you look back at the um the establishment we were sold quite clearly on the fact that rata was going to contribute um to the operational mean both netahu and rata were held up as groups within the city that would join in we would share operational costs so I was really interested to understand um what contribution rata has made in terms of operational costs and also what other parties in terms of operational funding through like naitahu or others that could could be involved going forward so we've had ongoing conversations with russia including as it was in that report which I was privy to as well the idea was there to approach rata to see if we could collaborate to save cost saving win wins working in collaborations our conversations of rata have been ongoing in that space but we're two fundamentally different types of organisations where there is opportunity to collaborate and those meetings were as recent as two weeks ago is around when we do already work together around some of our distributions and when we're working alongside the same projects information sharing and in fact the chief investment officers coming to our board now we're at the point we've got money to invest to help had none of the systems at startup that would have supported an organisation like us they aren't set up to manage donors they have a pot of money that they have they invest and then distribute the revenue off that annually we do part of that but we also have the other end of that process which is about building relationships with people that love our city and it surrounds encouraging them to gift to causes within our city and that requires quite specialist skills and software to do that so they've given us 12 and a half thousand dollars to date where we joint featured on the vital signs project which is research we've shared with you and made public which is looking at what are the priorities of residents of greater greatchurch that is the only funding we've seen to them at this point in time to establish the foundation were we told that there was an agreement with radar foundation of an estimated 225 thousand um could I try and answer that chairman that there was I saw that draft agreement it was through that obviously and I went and met the chief executive of rata at the time and I mean it was a draft agreement there was um it was the the I came away from that meeting thinking that the only real synergies between what they do and what we were what we are what then we were wishing to achieve was really accommodation and that would have been that would have been fine um except that their location wasn't in my view right for us secondly uh at that time I thought we would probably be able to get rent-free accommodation in a location that does suit us and subsequently we ended up paying you guys the rent right so you know like it there what's the opportunity going forward to get like because I thought that was one of the benefits when we were considering establishing it was that we had um a joint approach to supporting the city foundation so in terms of rather giving an ongoing annual operational grant is that something that's been have they like have you applied to them for don't meet the criteria of some of their grants rounds they're certainly ongoing conversations but that's a decision made by router's board or political appointments so we need to work through that process certainly we would appreciate some operational support from in terms of a way forward a shared partnership with a council rata naita who contribute I don't think we'll get funds from tahoe I think the more the easier place to get collaborations towards their operations is in our corporate partnership program which is already succeeding and we're already generating revenue out of that thanks cool so yanni we might just move around and then if you've got more than come back mike thank you just a few questions and just just oh I'm saying um leon said about that um the trustees um haven't_''_8760.64 received any fees so it's all the trustees from the get-go yes including london um the other question and I thought it was a valid question so this is the staff what has been the cost of this review now we set _''_8780.56 okay and um so was it a surprise to see that you know the donations that were related to the mosque attack were not included yet the cost to administer it were included in this review set to start yes the stuff uh look I do want to be clear that the benchmarking exercise was not perfect we had to work off publicly available information it's very clear in the report that is that it's given it's indicative only we weren't able to take out costs in this case the costs of the um mosque sorry the costs that the foundation incurred to manage the mosque donations that's very clearly stated in the report um the really the idea around the benchmarking was that it would it would give an indication of where the foundation sits alongside these others we noted that the other two were had been established long before and were in kind of more of a business as usual mode of operation whereas the foundation was new um we also noted uh that the different ways of treating the income that was there were different arrangements of funding across them essentially we were really just trying to give a very indicative position and and it it's come out reasonably balanced really um I i I it's really hard to do it's something that the sector really struggles to do and I think that the team at the council have actually tried with the best endeavors to do that and I support them in that yeah just trying to to me though it looks like and you were saying earlier that the fact that you know we're we're in including donations here but not actually the cost to administer it has it's fair to say excuse the end result sure and I would also say that in in the revenue and costs of the those other two foundations there could be similar sorts of things sitting in there for example we took out the hamilton foundation's uh revenue that was came to it from the crown for the regional theatre but we couldn't identify what costs they might have incurred in in dealing with that at where the foundation is sitting and it's it just is very hard to do and that's why there's a lot more information in the report other than just the benchmarking mr chair could I make an offer that we sit down together and develop a measurement framework that would serve both parties needs well let's that's that's really useful let's get around the questions and then when we get to the resolutions we'll note out here just just one sorry yeah so putting that aside is there anything else from this review that so this is the staff as well that have I guess you know have sort of all that's a bit I didn't see that coming you know there's any surprises in there anything that was unseen they've sort of come to light from this I i think we are learning as much as uh possible from this as well this sort of review um is a dual approach we've we had done a number of pieces well not me linda linda has done within our scheme of things being not a cco it's quite a difficult beast to deal with so what we learned from the from the deloitte's review is you can't ask all the questions and so therefore some things are going to be um if you took an assurance review i.e and audit you'd have a different result to saying where does the foundation fit in within the philanthropy community within christchurch or new zealand it's different all the world for safe because the work that they've done offshore which will lead to future revenue I mean we haven't isolated that we haven't said that we've got zero revenue from offshore and it's x amount of dollars in expenses why do that because there's no point um desegregating all that information what we've got here is the situation is that this is mosque attacks was different so therefore we we isolated that as much as we could therefore what we saw going forward is that the next budget that comes in we'll be looking at those benchmarks go down and that's what we're hoping is that the the insurances we've received from the trust is that with revenue going up those percentages will drop over time and that's the logic of this organization it's intergenerational we're expecting to see did we learn anything yes we have learned but I think working more closely with amy and and the chair and the hat mr it's we're going to get there we're going to get there thank you uh jake and then um just in terms of answering that big question we're dealing a lot in the theoretical in terms of what may or may not be in other foundations um balance sheets why don't we just yeah discuss what actually has been raised so if you take out the 11.4 for the mosque shootings they're just over one for two day 2.5 under contract for 2 so you've received one but there's another 1.45 million and that's that really you're getting yearly that 700k yeah um no 350 per annum 700 was's the outstanding how much have you raised excluding those two things excluding turanga and the shootings one point roughly four and a bit million dollars a quick calc in my head yeah thanks uh n thank you um I very much aware that this is you're in a startup phase here still with the with the foundation and so it would be fair to say that a lot of what we're talking about is a learning and that as um the foundation continues that a lot of this will be will be dealt with and ironed out would that be fair yeah I i think the review process has been as as the staff have said an excellent opportunity for us to learn around how we need to communicate with each other going forward I mean my tears made it very clear and it's certainly my intent too that we are working extremely hard to remove our reliance on council funding that is our goal we've made that very clear and we've made good progress to that this year and it's our intent to the end of our agreement and are working to honour that and I think what we've discovered now is that through this process there's ways that we can both work together to create great outcomes and there's a really exciting outcome coming next week where we've worked very closely with council to deliver a huge community outcome which has been funded in full and this is additional money not already in these figures to deliver a great outcome for our city and you'll all be receiving invitations to that later today uh so the opportunity to collaborate is clear and it's providing exciting opportunities for our city and its residents and we've certainly seen that in our collaboration with some of you or other cco's like christchurch and said I can't praise enough the collaborative way that we work with them we are hand in glove representing the city globally because we are a global organisation our focus somewhat reduced due to covert at this time is focused on helping bring new money to our city to amplify and make are already that's one are you sure humphrey you alluded to the fact that um auckland council gives a grant to a foundation are there other models throughout the country where that happens what do other councils well I've asked amy if she could get some data on that because it's quite interesting isn't it yeah so new plymouth district council's just gone into supporting te karaka which is their community foundation there and they've just begun supporting them because they've launched replicated our corporate partners model and launched it into new plymouth and part of that has been receiving funding from council to do that on an annual basis and from our point of view we can only base our stuff on on publicly available information in in trying to distill that information out of council's reports or another I think it becomes difficult unless it's explicit and so therefore that's when it becomes more difficult and analyzing it as we've said is there's nothing you can pick up which shows everything on philanthropy in new zealand uh have you got any more ann are you yeah so just on that new plymouth one how much are they contributing I don't know if I can find out I was certainly happy to let you know right okay okay cool does anyone else have any jeremy the staff information 2.24 regarding to the course the meeting objective I just want to know this is the figure the uh each dollar the dollar foundation incurred 56.1 cents of cost this is from the beginning up to now or is yearly yearly basis or what time time frame this one figure um where did this figure come from well the figures over the over the period of which they've been operating yeah you play two yeah I'm concerned because while we do have lost the most attack you know those the kind of of the event probably this vehicle will be increased a lot we actually came down jimmy so if you add the money we raise the fee per dollar into that calculations drops to 13 cents and a dollar so if we add that in foundation or your particular emphasis you've made a reduced abrasion expenditure by 24 percentage over 2019 to 20 by your volunteer you know try to reduce the 10 percent from the 600k to by 40k so this percentage difference my question is whether this reduction you know one is whether you still can meet your objective the other one these figures still escape what's the reason there you know there's a gap well could I perhaps talk to that second part of that which is the funding reduced by 10 yes but the budget the 24 relates to the budget between last year and this year so the budgeted cost they they have funding other funding that goes goes towards the cost so the costs are higher than our funding so I'm just saying their budget has reduced by 24 our funding has reduced by 10 percent okay so you mean it's not only the all council grand are there any other questions oh yanny or can I go I've got a couple and then we might go because they might hopefully answer them 300 grand sitting for additional operating costs if needed is that correct we've used some of that money over the time so we so we had to draw down upon some of that in our support of the victims of march 15. so we incurred an additional 115 odd thousand dollars in costs over that year and a half period so that's drawed down against that so how much is left now I'd have to go and look at the specific figures because I thought it was I'm sure it said in there there's three hundred no yeah that was the total amount see the size set aside but um they can tap on that at any point in time to cover their funding costs but that's still set aside now we have a small amount of money set aside for a rainy day because we never know when something like march 15 may occur again and we need to gear up which is sadly the reality we've faced in the last 10 years in the city okay um it's interesting so I raise it every time so you've got two more years of the funding cycle and it's worth noting it's up to six hundred thousand at the end of that like how confident are we we're going to get to a point because it talks about the need to have you know 17 odd million dollars and we won't be funded purely for endowment by that period of time it took acorn who's the most established community foundation 17 years to get to self-sufficiency using only an endowment model which is why we've gone to the fifa service model as well as the endowment model to generate additional operation revenue so we can remove our reliance on you yeah I mean it would be fair to say it would be nice to continue to have a relationship with the council beyond that date if you see value in that but I wouldn't expect it to be anywhere near at the levels that it is now yeah okay and so what work are you doing with other councils at the moment sort of meeting so I'm really happy to have that conversation in other locations we're in the middle of negotiations with a number of other entities around operational funding right now right okay so is it fair to say then if you are doing that that come first of july the 540 that's currently on budget I would hope it would be significantly less again if this last two days hasn't had a negative impact on that right okay and um humphrey the one about the the auckland was at 250 000. so if we were to take that approach um now can you just talk like if we were to look at amending that the money that's on budget now can you just talk me through how that would work you'd obviously have to go back to your board and make a few changes yes yeah um well at the end of the day chairman it's your decision as to the extent of support you want to give to philanthropy in christchurch that's the first question the second is do you want to to a conclusion on that then I think it would be appropriate to benchmark us off or off the sort of running average of new zealand cities you know um just just come to sort of a sensible dollar sun and uh and if if that was if if we could wave a magic wand and say that would be your policy come the end of this funding period then we would uh 100 pick up the balance of that funding ourselves of the cost to run the foundation okay it might mean some adjustment in our current structure if we hadn't got secured agreements but I have no doubt that we'd still exist so it's quite a yeah but in what way would we exist and how yeah how quickly we could have impact for our city would be significantly reduced yeah sure okay thank you yeah um yani I just just just want to be clear on a few things um one is that from council staff's point of view there's nothing of concern in the proposed budgets that have been put forward're waiting on the next set of budgets aren't we we haven't written them because our financial year is the same as yours so that that's one july one july so we're about to start our budgeting process for the next financial year but I thought we had to do that by the end of is at the end of march or the first of march no I'm going to give you we will have a uh a three-year forecast for you at the end of april beginning of may oh may sorry yeah so we need to so for this year's for the upcoming budget yeah we need to get that by the end of may yeah well we actually need to do it well before then um because we have to go back to the foundation end of april we'll have it too yes so in the pre in the previous two years with the budgets has there been anything of concern of councils any concerns that council staff have had around the cost of operations or the foundation in regards know so much well yeah I suppose our concerns have been driven out of needing to understand more about what sits beneath numbers but we're very conscious that this is not a cco and we we can't go um it's really up to the board to set its its budget and to some extent we have to we have to go with the the board's requirement to act in the best interest of the trust but if we're giving like 600 grand and we see 400 grand for marketing we'd probably go right so we have raised those questions and we rely on good on in good faith on the foundation's um ability to convince us that that there is method behind for example the marketing budget that it had in view it has in view of covert and the closed borders which means that they're switching say funding from travel into a heightened marketing program you know it makes sense and we've and that's our probing of that has led the key process for us going forward is to to a fund so um the process for us to consider the budget and get staff advice that will just happen in terms of regular reporting yes to the finance and performance committee yes um and at that stage that's the opportunity for us to consider the quantum and the concern around any appropriation of the budget in terms of how the foundation's I'm happy to receive that and table that at our meeting so I guess the other key thing from the deloitte report really it seems to be around the transparency um there's a number of things that you know and appreciate whether there'll be some commercial sensitivity there's a lot of comments around not being able to understand the the information in terms of value for money but also outcomes so just want to be really clear that the conflicts of um sorry the register uh for both the trustees in terms of the conflicts of interest um and the trustees interest sorry declaration of interest in the trustees conflicts uh up trustees register that will be provided so there's to see that yep is is that public information or is that it can be candidates I don't have a problem with that yeah so I think that's good there's nothing to hide that will give confidence to to people around one of the concerns that's been raised in the report I think the reference to the conflict of interest is there's some confusion around um some of my giving so to be very clear up until this year my company perception which now longer doesn't put into hiatus used to give 50 000 a year in pro bono services um and deloitte didn't know how to kind of box that up um and it has caused some issues for tina as well so um I have just cut that stopped that which is disappointing for the foundation and that was one of the reasons I took a reduction in my salary was because I strongly believe in this model so much so I've got skin in the game so amy just on that perception pr stuff so did you have staff doing that work all right so you're paying so it wasn't you doing any of it no right it was additional pro bono services after 50 000 a year yeah sure yeah and the other thing that's mentioned here's the procurement policy so again you've you've got a procurement we're not a cco we don't operate like a cco so you don't have any money to procure yeah yeah so I know you're trying to within the framework I guess the concern is like when you um spend operational money that we're giving you on services the process around procuring that we would go to market and ask for three quotes and choose the best quote which is normal business activity yeah okay and just the final thing is really probably a question for staff maybe the foundation do you think we need to change the supply agreement to get better clarity around some of these issues so that we don't have this kind of situation happening in the future part of what we're doing is we to explain things as we do with the other ccos and and that model is work will work better in the future and it means that if we're in regular communication with each other especially at governance to governance level um it'll actually help the relationship going forward and understand where everybody stands and how much skin everybody's got in the game as they miss and you know the invitation is very much open to come and chat and sit and look through stuff we can show you information quite happily that we can't put into the public realm and I have trust with this group here that we can do that and I'm happy to do that cool but it can't go into the public realm yeah I guess I would I would like to see stuff documented as because we've already heard that one of the issues if it's people-to-people is that if a person goes there's no recording oh I completely understand that that was pretty frustrating the other thing I would possibly add to that is that the quarterly reporting with with the foundation's agreement to provide that sort of information then I think the support agreement is fine so yani we might just move to aaron and then we'll try and conclude this if we can yeah um amy you keep um offering to meet with councillors and so on and so forth how many have come and met with you and sat down and gone through all their concerns none none none who've come to see us and ask us for more information right all right thanks for that helpful suggestion aaron uh any other questions I I'm a big fan of the old hilly yeah talk it out work out if you've got problems ask questions just directly to people right I need to meet with mike a few times have we got any more questions jimmy and then we try one more thing okay because are based on the paraguay 2.7 even the foundation the volunteer reduced the 60 000 k from the 600 to the 541 but in here particularly mentioned our council the supporters criteria is foundational presenter council the kind of even they have proposed the annual budget the case flow statement in any other relevant document and also the you know reasonable review essay tool and also on the quarterly activity the party forecast my question is even this is criteria whether still possible you know will be esco escalation or not in a annual basis up to the july 1st 20 sweep still have a two two years plus to go am I right two years yeah two years yeah still possible or not these are 60. reduce it maybe reduce more or not I'd like to reduce it significantly more it's a wish to reduce it yeah remember I just want to know you know you need to reflect your practical kind of the radio for mining the service essential based on your leader would that reduction impact yeah services uh it would if we had a significant cut in funding from the council for the new financial year we'd have to very quickly move to find a fill or adjust our model that's the reality oh yeah we're there basically uh right so we've got some resolutions on the table I've actually got one which I think is probably a good workaround based off your comments um before amy around the fact you're going out and trying to talk with others about funding that operating cost so what I might do is just get david to put them up and see whether people are comfortable with this approach it's a far more pragmatic than I think what's there now that's true don't worry it doesn't mention psychology with my glasses on just in a nutshell it's essentially going to say that we won't agree to the funding today you know because it wouldn't and it'll go through the long-term plan but what we'll do is we'd prefer that you come back um you know now that we've had time to flesh this out with you I think in a really healthy way um after you've gone and sort of got other partners to help fund that and then's sort of a sensible approach if people are comfortable with it I think david's going to try and wordsmith it okay so it's just up there so that's easy to read we can make it bigger too if it helps foundations provides advice on I mean they'll bring back something I just think clearly you need a bit more time to go away and work with the other partners to try and get some money and to fund those operating costs and this might be a sensible way rather than us putting an arbitrary line through it today yeah no no that makes perfect sense yeah yeah but that'll feed part of but basically this has to be done by the long term plan so if we have to go back is right so can we that's a valid point lynn or linda can you just explain what I want to know is is are they those recommendations there in a nutshell going to mean that we're not making decision on the funding today albeit it's in the draft ltp at from the foundation that in time for the the ltp sign off uh we can settle on an amount yes I said before chairman we will have information to you at the end of april sorry humphrey just the technical I just want to make sure technically ldp includes funding up to 540 000. if we receive their budgets and you decide that it's 500 there's no problem if you decide it's 700 there's a problem yeah I don't think we'll do that right okay so is that so technically this works yes so yani is that giving you some comfort or do you want that change yes so we get rid of the one to four if that's okay yeah I just think it'll give you a bit more time to make it work and then we can all go in and have a sensible approach on what level of funding it is you can do a workshop and go through it all yep and then you know you're part of that process cool so I'm happy to move discussion did you want to just make reference to the information that in the delight report that stuff yeah yeah hang on I'll just wait till then can you just move that tick box then it's a request that the christchurch financial provides advice on its quality reporting is to progress on achieving third-party funding operation admin costs but also but including the um the advice from deloitte's over what we should be getting yeah I think I think I thought without going into the delegates responsibly do you want the chief executive just to do that you're just going to raise it when you go through the advice of the key meta zone yes yeah but I think the resolution as it originally stands is fine yeah I think it's clearly there the relationship between the staff and christchurch foundation is collectively improving and I expect that to continue yeah and I think probably the message for oh yeah so comfortable so let's move second is there any debate that's perfect the only thing I'd just say is that like thank really helpful I'm pleased we could do it in a public environment given you know how it's paid out probably the message I've got from this is please go away and get some other funders to help with the operating costs I know you will yeah and hopefully this gives you both the time to go away and make that work work with the staff and then we can come back with a sensible approach for the long-term plan so yeah I'm very interested in that perfect thank you so much for your time and thanks for having us we'll put that to the vote all in favor say aye all right against that's carried excellent thank you all for thank you thanks everybody all right so coming back to the agenda um the rest of the agenda we are now at item 10 the financial performance report for the six months end of 31st december um bruce welcome to the table um are there any introductory remarks on this report item 10. thank you mr chia no the financial report for the first net 10 10.2 million dollar underspend at the end of december that's forecast to be slightly lower at 6.2 million at the end of the year after carry forwards it was forecast at 1.5 last time we reported to you in september so it has improved progressively over the last three months and in fact end of january it was 8.4 and we believe it'll be even even more positive at the end of february so that's all good signs the net underspin is made up of additional revenue a lot of that is turnover revenue which also has some additional costs associated with it reckon sport consenting interest costs and billwood landfill etc in terms of expenditure 13 million 13.7 million under budget at the end of december uh it's projected to be slightly over budget for those volume reasons at the end of june we've included a late table at 5.6 which gives a wee bit more detail on those underspins and where they're projected to be at year end and the reasons in terms of capital given the earlier report which bit earlier I just proposed to leave that information as it is happy to answer any questions all right thank you very much other questions on this report yani just one question on page 104 which is around the transport it's just the forecast under speed from the reduced road landscape maintenance we've just had the exceptions report we've seen um you know the high levels of satisfaction and the high number of complaints coming in around um roading maintenance so I just really interested in the comment there that says the forecast underspinners from reduced landscape um road landscape maintenance as this was cut back only to the most necessary maintenance I guess the concern is to really understand what's behind that given that you know I am getting on a regular basis complaints from residents around basic maintenance not being done so if we've got money available is there an issue around allocating that resource or is that more of a policy decision that's been made I would have to defer that question to someone from transport I'm happy just to get a memo back I guess the key takeaway we've just heard that we've got an issue with streets and transport in terms of maintenance and here we've got an under spend so how can we how can we use that to remediate we'll bring you a memo back councillor thank you any further questions tim yeah I'll follow on from yanis I'm getting a lot of calls with regards to the maintenance of the lack of maintenance to road reserves so just where that falls whether it's parks or roading but um around the hills um broad oaks would be an example where the locals are really concerned about the fire risk so it'd be really good to um hear back where that because if it is savings through reduced um service and then there is a concern in the community about that and there is proven fire risk then there will be an interesting discussion to hear so I'd be interested in that memo yep thank you anything else on this all right thank you I'm happy to second any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried now moving to item 11 and the corporate finance report again for the period ending 31st december yes bruce this is yours as well uh I guess key points in the executive summary uh standard and poor's reconfirmed our credit rating double a minus with a stable outlook uh all treasury risk positions within policy limits there's been a decrease in non-rate state and also a decrease in rate debt and in terms of 3.3.2 in terms of the the installment four deferments from last year currently as it last week there's about 127 000 outstanding so that's largely been paid those rate payers currently have a balanced outstanding of about half a million dollars so largely that issue has been dealt with um other than that uh 4.4.2 we've pre-funded 132 million of debt that's due for repayment in may so we've borrowed that early and invested it until may making us making a slight margin on it so it's um that's good and it reduces our's that's about all there is in the report that's of any significance all right thank you and I would also and you've highlighted it already draw attention to um paragraph 3.1.1 um we obviously were very pleased that standard poor has reaffirmed our rating at a minus in the current environment that was particularly good news so we're very happy about that and just one question on the comment you made around the rate status is that tracking pretty much as we would expect um given the um covert 19 payment extension is that how we would have expected that to track uh yes simple answer is yes it is um and it's it's quite quite positive the um the the rate state is uh not significantly more than it than it ever has been really yeah all right thank you any further questions on this report all right again I'm happy to move receipt of the report samuel ii any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried now we move to item 12 the capital delivery major table thank you any commentary on this um I'll just there's a couple of updates that's worth uh just a couple of things worth noting and the hornby elective member update we just want to early works has been uh confirmed and will be awarded and will be underway in march uh the blessing is uh this friday tomorrow so that's a couple of really good steps forward um design is moving at a pace so we're looking to prepare to go to market shortly on hornby as well um metro sports um we've probably talked to the enough about metro sports uh but there has been some substantial um activity on site and for those that yeah that uh blind you you certainly certainly can see the structure going up at the moment around the city from every window in this building anyway so um talk to old municipal chambers we continue to um uh carry out cyclical maintenance um the agreement that we've got with the uh city of christchurch trust and box 112 is uh is is is complete now city of christchurch trust to um I now sit on their pcg so their project control group um and they're working towards uh through developed design into detailed design and they've got quite a lot of that work completed today so they're looking to apply for consents very shortly so and they're also commencing the um wrap of the building within the next month as well which is another cost that that they're undertaking and there's a question around uh maintenance coming to an end which will come to an end in this financial year on that particular project because of the handover and the responsibilities sitting with the trust so and they'll take that further um and the timeline currently for construction is uh is still late 2022 completion at on the current program of work um just from the elective member for the member update for the square something to note is the police kiosk demolition which is due to be elected march and will commence in march that's the only thing I really want to mention on the square moving along at a pace and there are papers coming through in march for uh council's approval and the fmp committee approval so nothing more to say really um on the reports there oh thank you probably linwood sorry um yeah linwood's moving along at a pace and I'm actually missing the psg at the minute okay great thank you so moving to questions pauline thank you just on the square um I see that due to the distinction being a quarantine facility now the it's delayed that work around that south east but you've also seen there's a slight amendment of the design um of the landscape plan because they require some car accident yeah so look we it's a we're in um a concept mode at the moment anyway so we're ongoing discussions with the the ownership of the distinction hotel um we are continuing to complete those designs in readiness for the miq facility coming out of its period of uh yeah as a great mb but it's only minor amendments that's all it's not the ongoing design of that right it's nothing big no okay thank you any further questions on this report aaron yeah I just had a quick one but you've mostly answered it on the old municipal chambers so by next month's meeting will we see a new graph down the bottom of the timeline of what will be happening in the completion would you have that locked in by then we do have uh obviously through the agreement process we've gone through they've given us an indicative program already and it's extremely detailed to be quite honest um I think it's more around the timing of their start so and their consents are now they're now getting nearer and nearer to putting their designs into info consents once that's established then we can proceed to understand the actual impacts that will have on the program delivery yeah so at the minute the indicative is as ever is december 2022 so I would expect that to slip into 23 early 23 there's no doubt um but they're proactively trying to at the moment on access requirements because they're going in and out of the building to review certain areas to inform their structural engineering and also their ultimately their architectural design as well right okay so then we should get an update the next in two months time we certainly should have an update yeah oh okay that's quite good because you don't want to misread that because you changed one liter and it's cynical maintenance thank you yanny just in regards to the score and surrounds um the final bullet point development of strand lane um it says it will be finalized for construction to start after the post office strengthening it looks really exciting what's proposed for that site although I did note I think in the media that there was a request for a license to occupy or release area from council and I was just wondering if we're likely to get a sort of report around what's proposed what um the licensing or leasing will be and I guess also what the work and cathedral square around that would I can respond to the work that's required and with the lease I'll have to go away and ask and get the relevant information that's right but get relevant information but I can certainly uh talk to the work around because armature williams is carrying out the work for the chamberlain building the old post office yeah and we're working with um alexis williams at the moment around procuring their services to complete that work so that we don't have the same instance that we had with the spark building which was two separate contractors trying to work together to complete their work in timing with their work it's better if we can do it under a set said understanding of what are their what their profit margin is going to be that they'll want so we're doing this under agreed set terms really so I mean I'm really happy to hear that I think it just makes so much sense um so thank you just all I was what I was trying to understand though in terms of decision making we've already approved or is there a like a landscape plan this is a reinstatement of the pre-existing in that area it's not going to be a complete redraft of the um of the type of and the type of behaviors that are going down there it's going to be like for like but right yeah with with strengthening work obviously is that future proofed for yeah it's it's the now work really that we're doing so I can bring back the I can provide the documents that we've got in the designs we've got just as a maybe as in an email back to yourself yeah that that's cool so you've got that information yeah I think the key thing is in the consumer's race too with the distinction that we're not we'll start we're not spending money on something that we're going to dig up a year later because we've got some new fancy plan nowhere this is the permanent work for the medium term yeah okay that's fine all right I have secondary sam any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you and then moving straight on to item 13 canterbury multi-use arena elected members update so um first and foremost for those that don't know I'd like to introduce chris thomas he's the cmua pd limited project director for delivery of this so welcome chris I'm not asking him to speak to this just put names to faces so that you can you can see if there's anything you want to ask them please do um do you want to take the update as red or we just want to give you a quick update on our current status at the moment I think we can take the update as red it's just if there's anything to add that's happened since the update was prepared we can talk to we've just completed obviously um the rfp closed on in on 29th of january we've just spent probably the most intensive reading of document period for about three weeks and we've gone through's been a highlight a highlight of my career today to to to see the uh the positive response we've had and to see the level of um capability that's wants to come here and do this particularly and carry out this particular project um we obviously can't talk much more about it really we're in the process of a due process that we have to go through in order to appoint so we will be bringing that back to council on the 25th of march so which will be an agreement uh to proceed with the pre-contract services agreement so that's the status of the project today with regards to on-site works enabling works are completed to a degree they're now within the site boundary um the cone cones or the permanent bollards that are in place on litchfield and cashel street are part and parcel of the permanency and the road stopping exercise that we're going through which is being is underway and the signage that supports that and the warnings to people and the signing of that um I did an update from our project manager regarding ongoing discussions with our transport team in-house regarding the sequencing of the lights in the area and improving that sequence sequencing so that the traffic flow can be enhanced uh so that's ongoing uh the only other thing we haven't spoken about is the signage and and and further signage to assist the public and I'll I'll uh investigate that over the next day or so so that's the latest update on the actual project itself excellent thank you thanks very much are there any questions just the one off the transport one which was surely the lights at cashel barbados can actually be removed now because it's just a t intersection yeah so that's underway it's more around the flow on barbados and madras which is being impacted by the sequences of the lights so the team are currently talking to transport about how they improve that so I think we're it's a can you can you actually switch those lights off in the meantime before they're removed that's exactly mean there's just been a little bit of chitta chatter around it solution yeah can you take the left and right arrows out of all the other lights thank you we'll address it thank you um yani you've got a question I just um I mean I know we've kind of considered that but it does seem quite sad that the ng building is is having to be removed is there any opportunity what's the opportunity within the design to incorporate that is there any um I mean it's just been in the media again recently so is there any solution that could be found possibly to retain that heritage building I think I have to refer you're back to linz and lin's acquiring that as part and parcel of the original um recovery plan and that's where we're at with that with with that particular property at the moment so I mean I guess I just read like you know the 10-year reflection of the quake and there's some been some pretty interesting and reflective pieces on the is there any way that if that property is acquired that it could be retained until the design is finalized so that we don't lose the opportunity to incorporate it if it's possible it's I suppose the the intent of the uh precinct as a whole is not just the pre the precinct as a whole is clear by that one property and the to maximize the benefits to the community we've got to give that opportunity to the design team and the period that we're entering entering into at the moment is that design consortium phase which is about maximizing the opportunities for the whole of the city and how we place the eventual arena on the site and locate it is yet to be defined totally we've only ever been under the we've only ever had a proof of concept which we've had which was about um ensuring the quality of the investment case that we put to the crown and council so yeah that building sits with lens at the moment I can't really comment sorry all I it have to be demolished straight away or can it be given a bit of a stay while the design mr chairman that that's for lin's too it's it's oh yeah okay yeah yeah okay as mary says we probably have this discussion when we come back yeah I think it would be you know I mean I don't know if others read the the pieces that were written about the lost heritage in the city but it was I just thought it was quite important but it's also about it's also about the future yeah let's pick it up at the appropriate time yeah all right thank you any further questions on this particular report all right so I'm happy to move receipt of the report tim mule second any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried alastair thank you very much indeed thank you all right now we move to item 14 the closeout report on stapleton's road randall street and peshwa street renewal so let's take any commentary on this first one's anything the staff particularly want to highlight um and then we'll take any questions thank you mr chair um I would like to take a moment at your discretion to just put a bit of context behind this because there have been a couple of couple questions so yeah stapleton's um gosh I can't even get this straight stapleton's randall and petrie street are in the richmond area the um the council many of the council many many of you will remember the dudley creek bypass went through this suburb post earthquake and um it was part it was a big part of the land drainage program at the time and at the time also there was skirt works going on across the city so there were two streets in this report petrie street and sort of two thirds of randall street were going needed to be reinstated post the dudley's creek bypass going down those streets so and then uh and the dudley creek bypass was reported to this committee at on the 5th of december 2018. so that close-out report has been plan there was a lot of feedback from the richmond community they'd had a lot of works in the area where they'd had a lot of construction trucks and they were you know and these streets were in pretty poor condition that was the feedback we were getting staff worked with the community and community groups to understand their understand their concerns and as a result of that we developed a program of works that was put into the ltp and has since been progressed these are those these are the first of these streets that you're seeing today staff um the transport team also took over the responsibility of the final reinstatement for those bits of petrie and randall that the dudley creek bypass had um wiped out pretty much because they pretty much had gone down the whole street they'd taken the whole thing out to put their big put the big culvert down there um and I think post this report at post that time we have worked together better as teams across council to make sure we are coordinating our works where renewals but when we've got big assets reinstatements like the dudley creek bypass we are trying a lot better to have a better outcome for the community post that works other than that if we jump forward to doing these straights uh kuster here was the project manager and on the whole the works went really well the community's been very positive about what we're doing we've still got more works going on in that suburb so there are more streets to report on in the future great thank you and thank you for that um particular um update as well um that helps to put this report in context um I mean it may be that in future with these reports it would be good to have that contextual information as part of the report but it's great that you've been able to provide that verbally to the meeting today so that we can see this report in that broader context of the the particular situation at the time chair I'm very supportive of that approach as well yeah so that it committee yep great thank you very much so are there any questions on this look I think everyone agrees especially in the community that you know the outcome after everything was some was was really good but I guess from an elected member's point of view um it didn't seem to be as smooth sailing as this report and it's great that you know we've obviously looked at you know we've combined the work that were happening to make sure we got everything done um but from my record collection it was it wasn't that straight straight forward to get that little bit of randall added to this whole project um outcome was good but I guess when I look at the lessons there was a workshop and it included a number of people the one thing that's missing from there I guess would be um governance perspective so potentially at the ward councillor they say hey look these are some of the issues that we found from our point of view to make sure I guess that would could be developed moving but can I can I can I respond yes and we are starting to do that more and more um so we are looking to do the same thing with uh with your own board about the downstream effects works that have been done um from the cnc so that is that is something that we are looking to try and do more of and report back through the boards as well and get that feedback I think to be fair to the roading team and the transport team the issues that were being had and the concerns that were being had that resulted in the community meeting we're about the dudley creek bypass so and I get like I understand I'm gonna go as a transport team yeah I'm just saying when we look at the you know the map of what was done and it includes the the whole length of randall street and I just know when we were when we were going through that time was it wasn't that straightforward we felt from our point of view to actually ensure that the the outcome was great um so yeah got to the outcome yeah but it was because only two-thirds of the street was being was funded as far as that yeah no I understand that and I guess yeah like I said moving forward lessons learned we just need to and this was back in 2017-18 yeah when we were having these conversations so could it be worth putting a noting provision in there noting that in future closeout reports will invite comment from local councils it's not so much the closeout report it's the project itself um well I mean I think yeah you know this is the closeout report doing exactly what we want it to do which is you know looking back on the project here we've got a report that on the face of it um you know certainly if you read the report it would appear that you know this project was delivered well and the community were happy with the outcome all of that is true but clearly there were some conversations that happened along the way and some frustrations along the as perhaps um have been described by the local councillor I think that tells us something first of all about the the purpose of these reports it's good that this report generates the discussion we're having now um secondly and picking up on the point that I made earlier um it's important that we put any contextual information into these reports in future so that we get a a fair picture of how this project was delivered but in the context of you know other the the yeah how the the the um project which is the subject of the report was delivered noting anything that happened along the way and noting any contextual information within which that project rightly sets up so to be clear from the perspective of the whole organisation both members and officers the point of a close-out report should be to understand what we did well what didn't go as well and what we would change and making sure we make those changes and they stick and that's about being a really good learning organization I think these reports are I think the members are raising a legitimate issue in terms of how we get that voice and I know this history and I appreciate that but there is a way we can do that I'm sure yeah yeah this is this is the closeout report doing exactly what it's intended to do which is saying when we come across you know issues like the one that's been described involving the elected members giving the elected members a heads up having early elected member involvement probably could help avoid that sort of situation or resolve it more easily in future that's this closeout report raising that discussion exactly the purpose of the closeout report andrew sorry just to clarify saying I'm not the local councillor it's pauline right board member thank you okay um so yarning I think the problem with like this report is it focuses at a very detailed level on what was done but it doesn't focus on that high-level strategic question around why land drainage projects weren't incorporated with roading at the start and that's probably the who's had projects in my ward where residents have asked for similar things to happen and they're not happening so you know I'd be really interested if there was any kind of lessons learned around how you can get a greater synergy around a land drainage project and then what's the outcome in terms of the final road roading project and I think you correctly yani because the land drainage work had to be done first then it became a transport project to reinstate it's just that one piece of the road was not included in either of them all right can I get some comment from staff on this if that's possible that's not actually 100 correct the land drainage project was going through and the land drainage project was needed to reinstate those two pieces of road as as staff we are looking and we need to look more at how we can get benefit for the community when we put really large um really large infrastructure projects right through communities like this we're working hard to try and achieve in this area the transport unit wasn't it didn't actually have a program of works in the richmond area so there was a hot there was a whole another level of complexity complexity and noise those two streets were always being there we're following the feedback from the community meetings and the ltp we developed a programmer works now these projects were on it and these projects were always prioritized on that and we've got a prioritized programmer works that is rolling out through the richmond area over the next 10 years got me really confused are you saying that then when a land drainage project comes through a street rips up the whole street puts a pipe down the middle of it the land drainage section is renews the street or completes the stream so when you have what you're seeing when a utility goes through a street yeah so any utility via empower anyone they are only responsible for reinstating what they need to and that's what they have impact that's what I was saying and so the other end of't_''_12576.96 that's exactly right but that's the kind of lesson that there wasn't a there wasn't a street there wasn't a streets program in there either that's right because of the skirt works that was going on so there was a whole level of complexity around this particular area yeah that we then worked with the community and I think that's the good news story land drainage and transport and three waters all work with the community and everyone knows the priority and the program moving forward so that is the good news part of this question the three waters kind of department like so I mean I went and looked at the children straight brick barrel amazing job they're doing there but if you go down chilling straight on the footpaths that's completely mounted right so they're going to spend all this time reinstating the middle of the road when you've got buggered foot piles on each side for a small well not small but for a cost-effective variation to the contract to do it do it once do the road it seems like a really sensible thing to do so I mean that's the sort of lesson learnt that I was kind of hoping that we would get from this is where there's opportunities to do synergy here's the process we use to consider it so that is a separate matter than you were previously discussing in the last 10 minutes because that also needs to relate to the fact that might be an additional project that you do not have on budget and you've just gone through all of the capital programme in terms of proposing my might what might go forward in terms of the ltp your point in principle capital I think is well made and it's ensuring that we both maximize what we do to the community once rather than five times or whatever it might be and if there is opportunity to do additional in an effective and efficient way and you have the resources to do that then we should take those but do not assume that means every time we dig somewhere we're therefore budget but it's the process to consider whether we do it or not and at what level and that was I mean without the community raising up on this one I don't think it would have happened yeah um and some communities won't raise up but it might be sensible to do it so if there's a process around it then we can we can through the chair it does happen and it does happen all the time we are we sit on the same floor as our colleagues in three waters and they're quite nice people I quite like talking to them so like we do we do all the time um we did hereford street recently we've replaced the water main we did record and road we did it all together so we do it all the time but as dawn's just pointed out it depends on the age of the asset the condition of the asset and that and um the budgets that we've got available yeah I think all of that's well understood and and thank you this on because we're required to warn already and I'll come to you for a further question uh it's not a question it's just actually to reinforce and and to endorse what lynette said you know we just had a briefing last night at our community board where we had a team of all those people that were working together to make sure ireland middleton road gripperton road were working you know together so I think you know it is happening all right thank you any further questions on this report all right so we are removing receipt of the report um I'm happy to move that do I have a second or jimmy chen is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried so now we move to item 15 the audit and risk management committee remuneration for independent members um so linda you're presenting on this one and len welcome back to the table as well all right so ian there was a matter came up earlier regarding the fact that we've got the increase in a um public excluded attachment um would you be able to make some comment on the public excluded nature of what's in that you know the reason why the information is sitting where it is yes um it seems to me from what I've been able to ascertain that that information should have in fact gone into the public part of the report it was only the comparative um information around other local authorities that was to remain in px so I suggest a way around that is that we just add a recommendation that the council agrees that the px attachment remuneration armc independent chair and members be removed from px and attached to the public report yeah so that then just to clarify brings the remuneration information as it relates to this council into the public report yes but the comparative information remains in public excluded because that's not our information to bring into the public arena it's provided to us on a confidential basis that's fine all right thank you for that so if we can just add that resolution all right this report we can take it as read and the information and it's um reasonably easy to understand I think it's fair to say is there anything that you wanted to draw to our attention before we move to questions okay we'd like to tag and read answering equations all right thank you um so other questions all right no questions so sam you're happy to move is there a seconder phil you're happy to second is there any debate yummy um probably doesn't come as a surprise to most people on this room but I certainly will not be supporting the increase at the moment I believe with the financial situation we're in especially with um covert 19 and the impact that that's had on our budgets um that we're not in a position to be able to afford this increase I think there would be suitable people that would do it for the current fees and I am not supportive of increasing the fees at this stage sam you're thinking I do understand what yanI's saying but to appoint people to this committee it's very clear that if you pay peanuts you will get monkeys this hasn't been reviewed since 2013. it's a very small amount of money in the scale of things and like you said um you know yanni in terms of the financial implications that's why we need really good competent independent people we get incredible value for money from the people we have there now and so I do hope that people um you know respect this and and do support it the best thing about this is that we've agreed a process going forward in terms of how we'll review it so we won't get caught out like this again um but you know I just need to emphasize you know in the scale of things um you know these guys aren't here doing it for money they're in the commercial sector they paid a lot more than this and we get tremendous value from them um I would echo that comment the independent members um and the independent chair in fact bring and risk management committee it's an extremely important committee of council a lot of the work that goes through that committee it needs to be done well it's one area where they need to be very clear focus and certainly those independent members bring that clarity of focus and that rigor to the committee a different set of eyes or different sets of ice and outside of our organization particularly around that table in my view bring huge value just reiterating the comment that sam has made regarding the recruitment process we didn't have a wide range of choice when we went through that process I believe that we were very fortunate to have good people that were able to be appointed and I'm very comfortable with the appointments that we've been we made but to to suggest that we have a right a wide range of capable people to choose from certainly wasn't our experience at the time that we made um that last set of appointments liam when I became the mayor that this wasn't a position held by an independent two extraordinary people who've stepped up to taken up that independent chairs role it previously was chaired by a council in fact um the previous chair of the audit and risk committee was in the room before um helen broughton and I think it's really important that we do have independence and that's what these people bring to the table this is always a risk when you don't keep the when you don't keep the remuneration up to date and when you let it sit for eight years then it looks like a bigger jump than it actually is so over the period of time I think if we'd move things gradually which is the go forward position uh then it wouldn't look like the the jump that it is I know that times are difficult for people but we do need from a council position to have independent eyes over our books and the value that they add to this organisation benefits all the residents of christchurch so I'm very happy to support the resolution thank you any further contribution to sympathy for um what once again for what yani has put but I more fully support the statements made since by the other three speakers but I also want to underline that the fact that we're paying a very low and it is a quite a low fee uh doesn't mean I'm pleased that the deputy mayor said that we did get they were happy or we were happy with what we um got in terms of an appointment because someone mentioned you pay peanuts you get monkeys we don't have monkeys thank you so this has been moved and seconded um I will put the motion all those in favor say aye against so we'll just note that um so yani and mike as well yep so we'll just move this and that's carried thank you all right so now we move to the resolution to exclude the public as set out on pages 164 to of our agenda which I'm happy to move samuel happy to second all those in favor say aye against that's carried and we'll just wait for the room you
Uh and now we have the waihoro uh spread and kashmir community board report and we have carolyn potter chair lee with you today and community governance manager joe wells kiera tarteau um before we start I used to work at the human rights commission and had a stall at um um what am I saying and are we the village atmosphere cannot be replaced in haggy park you know I just want to reiterate what everyone else has said the village atmosphere couldn't be replaced anywhere it's a wonderful wonderful occasion we I had the most boring stall but the but the occasion was terrific we we've got one pate which is a very small change to the design of the woosley's kashmir road hun hey intersection which we are very much looking forward to as is the local community at craycroft that was to take out designated crossings because the expectation of children would have been that they were totally safe and they wouldn't have been totally safe on these crossings and so the traffic guys have removed them but we are committed the intersection opens with the lights installed this is where the adventure park comes off and all sorts of other things and new developments um up that valley and um at this intersection um remodeling is is now overdue really um the the we've got an innovating streets for people projects two of them going in our ward one in beckham and one and selwyn both of these had activities going in this last month and I have I regularly report to the board via the board representation on their committees and there's naturally some demands where they would like greater input than they are possibly going to get out of it but nonetheless it's a very interesting project um the uh where am I coronation hall is albeit moving like a snail it will eventually get there I'd like to report that and I'd like to hear from other boards on this issue we have had many requests for basketball courts in our awards um ranging from a nation a man who was over 80 who wrote to the board saying that he believed are now working on it from the high schools in our area to have a look at where the best location would be the council can't possibly keep up with the demand but it is an indication of how parents and young people believe that basketball is one of the most flexible games you can have and is enjoyed by so many people in small groups and large the public forum presentations have as usual been really interesting they're great and our board we get a lot of people coming to talk to us and um the hoon hey community association trust provided an update on their activities the old stone house wants to have a farmers market given given that it was one of the first farms in christchurch it is incongruous that the reserve status makes it difficult to have a farmers market there but we hope to be able to make pro progress on that and another issue was uh traffic concerns um we've also made progress on the community plan I'd like to just oh and if we go through the photographs this is the second year of her own initiative that she has handed out sunflower seeds packaged them up put them in letterboxes organised weekly prizes and so on the middle of sunflower modestly just happens to be mine I know you had no idea I planted a heck of a lot of sunflowers this is the only one that grew but look at it it's got a very low fence no it's not and I thought that damn thing's going to come into the house one day and eat me it's gigantic but that but the important thing was that again the picnic was spoiled a bit by um the cold but there were 40 people there and with kids receiving prizes from ruth as she presented to them and it was the most it's been the most imaginative initiative that you could imagine and uh the way the prizes are presented for all sorts of weirdo things in terms of sunflowers and she is just to be congratulated for her efforts in the community people really love this one and the kids love um commissioned a a small carving to honour the losses in the muslim massacre two years ago and we had a presentation at the rally resource center there was a person who spoke there who was the mother of one of the boys who died and two of the siblings were there one of whom is doing philosophy and wants to go to cambridge and the other one and the young the youngest child a daughter wants to do drama when she leaves school they live on rallyev and her discussion about her family was incredibly touching um this was what are they called the tribal um nation tribal nations there was a photograph of me with the leader at one stage all dressed completely in his leather I i think there was about 60 bikes 70 bikes and they did a raw through rowley and then turned up at mathers park where there were several small events associated with the battle to combat team suicide and they were dressed in um they dressed in absolute leathers and they have the most fantastic bikes and it ended with the bikees that was just such great fun on the courts that are to the right and look at the colours that they were throwing around the place as well the kids really loved it it was a very positive thing from a positive group to turn up on their bikes as they have done everywhere in the south island and tribal nations to talk about it now this this is my humiliation because I said men's sheds that had their day and this is um a huge group of men at the opening of their men's sheds who absolutely have done wonders in our community the saint martin's volunteer library people came up to me the other day and said they couldn't have done it without the men's shed they are building small things for people all throughout our area and they're open to any suggestions and they have been a wonderful group like me sitting there saying men's sheds days had their day this is around the corner from me we initially visited this this is part of the flood storage and stormwater very privileged to be at the head of the apowahoh hezkid and but part of the penalty of being near the river has been that it has flooded the drainage team and and other teams and council are doing the most imaginative work right throughout our wards in developing flood basins to take the headwater floods so that downstream floods are ameliorated it's been a great excellent wonderful project this had been disappointing the plantings in the water are going great guns but the plantings and the wider walkway area which you can't see there properly most of them died on the first plantings and the second plantings are taking a while to grow but we met with um the team who are involved and they are trying to repeat the um wonderful work of hugh wilson over in accara where he grew the plants from seed through the weeds and the foliage and gourds that was already there that's what they're trying to do but they hadn't explained it to the neighbors who only could see weeds and plants dying but were through lack discussed it with the local neighbours so we met on site the whole board went and met them on site and they have agreed to put out a leaflet which we will let a box right through our neighborhood and explain the theory behind it because the council at the moment is really pressed for plants that have grown so there's all sorts of reasons for trying this new method of getting it going but it wasn't easily understood by the neighbours and not by me that particularly but now it's starting to we now that we've got the theory behind it we understand why the weeds are predominant we are very interested in the commitment that the team have made towards this it's going to be wonderful all through our ward there are flood basins being developed on their way to being developed they have been turned into walkways for people as well and it's just fantastic work by the council post earthquake just fantastic work um what are we talking uh traffic safety oh this is the big issue we had a a principal's meeting as well and we had a principal's meeting the other night which is the other morning sorry which is hugely interesting in terms of the things that they say to us about our local communities they have a view of the local communities that the rest of us don't see don't see and some of it's heartbreaking and some of it's um enchanting but um it's totally worthwhile and we're going to persevere with the principal's breakfast but the road safety and traffic safety is a very big thing that they bring to us and these are the areas some of the areas that we're interested in and finally I want to risk your patience just by mentioning the draft tree policy again which I am have been opposed to in so many respects the board has requested in the light of the commission for climate change that I say again that we believe the draft tree policy and its lack of emphasis on native plantings in the city urban area be addressed the climate change policy emphasizes the importance of native plantings and it's not by accident that christchurch has no very few sorry native birds in our urban area it's not by accident that we are one of the very few urban areas in the whole of new zealand that does not have populations of native birds in the urban area and I do think that the tree policy is a really worthwhile accept except when it talks about planting exotic trees in the urban um in the urban area they say it's going to be addressed by the urban forest and bush plan it's a conversation I can't believe that I can't believe the dominance of north northern hemisphere academia and some of the things that we do and the urban and bush forest plan but I don't believe that the tree policy reflects what we should be doing in the urban area either thank you for your patience you didn't interrupt the aliyah and I'm really grateful you did actually tempt me with that last one because you can't use a presentation to a last-ditch attempt on something that's been to a hearings panel I know I know you cannot but but I was going to reassure you that I was regarding it as a an early submission on the urban treatment I know it's only me that does it but that's what I want it to be called because we are not northern hemisphere I take this as an early representation in that regard not as a deputation on the on a item on the agenda for today thank you for your patience thanks carolyn um just regarding the northern head dominance um I'd just like to actually acknowledge our chief executive and say I do like her dominance within the organisation oh honestly totally mike and melanie thank you caroline just a question on your part a what was the feedback to the board from the um blind low vision new zealand around removing the pedestrian crossings no I think they're behind that in terms of safety yeah but have you had official feedback from no I haven't actually to tell you the absolute truth length and the only um request that we made was that it be looked at again in six months because the arguments were persuasive so I certainly can't answer that question okay I'll start thanks melanie um just a quick comments and I um carolyn's presentation would you like to all all it was is to say is that did you remove it then and seconded by tim can I make a quick comment yes um ruth who you saw with the sunflower dress on I saw on tuesday she's eight months pregnant so she's seven months pregnant in that photo and she also had advertised a sustainable edible garden awards we had the most applications this year one of her awards was to if you had entered our award a community board award she gave them an award so she's brilliant she is tim thank you and I guess the photo that we had last with regards to the barrington cashmere roundabout was actually a very very good one because it really highlights in our report which carolyn very aptly put forward the staff do that are absolutely outstanding and there are frustrations with the community sometimes because they see a chance and they go big but you know we do have to be realistic but these are absolutely outstanding projects which staff do really well and then we've had a couple of projects in our area which have totally kneecapped everything that we've done and I've arranged a meeting with um the ce over the two one also affects westmoreland and it's just so disheartening to go to meetings um which and I couldn't make one of them and thank you very much for that carolyn's I've been ill but you know you as a elected member you don't have a leg to stand on literally because of the process which council has gone through so it's a kind of one step forward and then you just stop so I just want to highlight that I'm really disappointed in some of it the board backs him in the statements there I would have raised it myself but um we still we're been very difficult thank you thank you very much I'll put the motion all those in favor say I i suppose they know that's carried thank you and uh we've got the um oh
Set out on pages one six four two one six six of our agenda which I'm happy to move samuel happy to second all those in favor say aye against that's carried and we'll just wait for the room you
Chia and simon britain deputy chair and community governance manager elizabeth elizabeth not community governance manager right just just to talk just the two okay so thank you for having us along today um we do not have any part a's and we're going to take the report as read um so we're just going to highlight a couple of things that have been happening around our area these first photos here are um pictures of some recipients of our positive youth development fund um they were a group of scouts who went to stavely adventure camp um we have noticed this year even without international competitions and opportunities for young people involving international travel we've still had a good number of applicants for this fund which is great to see and the best part for us is having them come back and speak to us and report about what they're doing and sharing their experiences and their learnings so that's great this photo is from lan place in belfast it was one of 27 summer with your neighbours events that were supported by again that someone with your neighbours dates back to neighbourhood week which started in 1998 under the what was then the shirley papanui community board and yeah it's always a real pleasure again as ms commented with the youth development fund again with these just to hear back from people a small contribution from the community board out of that community funds can really help unlock those events and get things happening for people and these pictures here from the papanoi youth development trust's christmas function and I just wanted to take this opportunity opportunity to give a big shout out to this group they have over the past year with what's been happening they have adapted and changed and worked really hard to continue engaging with young people in the area um and back into the swing of things again this year um with their programs all back underway they will go running new craft classes for young people and they've got their ever popular band nights which are well attended and gives young bands in the area an opportunity to perform and then they is at one he would road um and they're programmed to loop um so the trust's name is still the same but they're they everything else they're calling loop um to reflect their purpose of bringing the community together and taking young people full circle so big thanks to everything they do in our community you'll recall last month we talked about the sundarban skate jam since then we've had the belfast skate jam these are about fostering a community recreation approach targeting grassroots participation in school development at belfast we have over 100 skaters participate and over 200 members of the public there in total on a friday afternoon that event was organised by belfast community network and the community recreation advisor from our board area so yeah thank you to that group and to helen as well for enabling that to go ahead and that's us thanks very good thank you very much um so pauline you'd like to move that and mike you'd like to second up are there any questions any comments nope I'll put the say no that's carried thank you very much
And tim scandret can you both just indicate that you can hear me all right hello yeah very good thank you um so good morning everyone uh I've got uh apologies this is a reconvened meeting so for this part of the meeting I have apologies from councillor major for lateness and as you've heard councillor chu and scandret are joining by zoom and successfully so would someone like to move the apology for lateness uh pauline cotter seconded aaron kieran I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried um and where we move to item uh the next item which is uh I don't know why it's called item three but the draft long-term plan um 2021-31 and uh I'm just going to run through the procedure for today as I said at the beginning this is the reconvened meeting regarding the draft long-term plan and on the first day of the meeting we passed a number of resolutions subject to the inclusion of the auditor general's report we now have the auditor be signed by myself and the chief executive the consultation document had been updated to reflect the comments made by audit new zealand prior to the auditor general's report being provided and these documents are available to have been made available to councillors prior to the meeting so I've got council officials at the table but I wondered whether andy burns whether you'd like to come and join us at the table as well and from audit new zealand to present the the report and um answer any additional questions so the issues for today's meeting are simply in relation to the auditor-general's report as we attended to the other matters the other day okay welcome welcome yes please oh okay so thank you thanks for that man you need to have your excuse me the audit's complete and we've got another opinion for you that's the most important thing and what does that mean uh it means that we are comfortable that your consul consultation documents appropriate for consultation and it also means that we've looked at this supporting evidence also appropriate for consultation um the opinion is essentially clean with with one national exception and there's what we call the nemesis of matter in the audit opinion and that is simply and as I say it applies to all councils drawing attention to what you all know which is there are some water reforms coming over the hill and that might have significant implications for all councils at this point in time the plan assumes the status quo and and tells the the the the right payer that this is all happening so we're simply drawing attention to that reference in your own consultation document to say look this is important look at it uh it doesn't anyway detract from the document I suppose it tells you that there might be another one coming something coming later on um but that's after due process has been observed so that's all I want to say your worship the audit's done yeah it's a clean opinion subject to that but that's not an unclean it's simply a reference to something that's as if these services will continue to be provided by the council but future decisions may result in significant changes which would affect the information on which the consultation document has been based um that that's a statement that's literally going into every consultation document around the country to the best of my knowledge there may be a regional council here and there that doesn't get that reference depending on the answer to which they touch sorry the local council said that that's right um in this area that's right and uh and it is appropriate that we um prepare it on the basis as if the services will continue because we don't simply have um a steer from central government about what that final decision will be I think that's a view taken across the sector that it's appropriate to do that way good thank you did you want to say a few words yeah I'll just hand over to the chief executive because she did want to mention something to you okay thank you mayor andy we just wanted us all the way through the period it is absolutely right that the council has taken a very deep look at what it's been doing and you've been engaged in that and I'm grateful that you've been able to see how we how far and deep and wide we have gone you've recognised it and you've helped us to be able to get through the wellington hot house work this is normal and we're grateful for that thank you okay thank you it's always an interesting ride and a good robust discussion so that's fine I must admit that when we had the meeting commence last week uh I i was uh I wasn't entirely at 100 sure that we would get to the meeting today but thank you very much for all that you've done to assist us to meet our obligations and enable us to confirm uh matters so that we can proceed to the timetable that we've said really appreciate it thank you pleasure oh yanni has a question for you I just had one uh multi-use arena and whether you think the consultation docu accurately reflects the increase associated to that as part of looking at the underlying information we look at the support information that supports the financials so we have looked at um whether the information used in the financial model is is the latest available and come to the view that it is if that answers your question yep yeah I mean I'm just concerned that there's additional spending going in because of the stadium that's not explicitly called out in the consultation document not to our knowledge um the one thing we do know about large capital projects is they can take cost more than an original estimate as far to the best of my knowledge the information in the plan or in the supporting information is consistent with the best available information this one in time perhaps I'll ask that of staff because I mean this was raised as well sorry I think that yanI's raising the question about the um uh the costs associated with the transport changes in and around so it it's not just transport it's there's some waste stuff water stuff um there's about 33 million extra as I've calculated it which has all been debated as we've gone through various things okay so the question is does every element of the change to the capital program need to be highlighted in the consultation document now council decides what it wants to put in a consultation document there is a program that has been previously consulted on and engaged with government on uh these things aren't and the the cd the whole program is in the cd in terms of in terms of affordability yeah but there isn't a requirement to pull up unless you wish to specific changes yeah and we we haven't chosen to do so so thank you any other questions all right look thank you very much it's it's very much appreciated that you were able to come today as well and um and to hear our great gratitude thank you for all of the hard work that you and your team have done so so now we'll move to the um to the resolutions and uh I didn't send out a wee note before just to let you know that we've broken down the um uh last uh um resolution so the first resolution is to receive the report and authorise the second one is to authorise the mayor and chief executive to sign the letter of representation and then having received the auditor general's report formally adopt the information and that provides the basis for the draft ltp and the consultation document now these were um two elements that were uh voted against by some councillors last time so I'll put the two of them separately and the third one is the consultation process which nobody seemed to object to last time so I'll I'll put that in with 9 10 and 11c so is that all right all good so um this is a very minor thing and and it's around the three waters reform in the in the document and it's on page 16 when it says we will be consulting with be quite good if that was written in bold so that people don't get confused there's just a small thing that I'm saying and the consultation documents itself we can deal with we can deal with that because I mean I agree with you people people do need to know that we will be coming back to consult later in the year um you don't need a resolution but I can do but the legislation hasn't been passed yet so yeah um yani um just also on the rubbish recycling and organics in the actual submission form um it doesn't state that it's a legal requirement that we must upgrade the organics plant to meet the statutory responsibility it just asks if we've got the balance right and it talks about the changeaway culture changing our throwaway culture and reducing the amount of waste but I think it's quite important to highlight specifically in bold that the upgrades to the organics processing plant are statutory obligation they're not actually a choice I mean again we don't need a resolution amendments it's probably just a few minor remember yeah okay yeah um cool because you've already adopted the document and then you got I mean you know about my concern with the stadium or the multi-use arena so yeah I still can't understand why that isn't cooled up when other projects that are way less we haven't_''_1693.12 we haven't resolved to include it within it so um I I'll move these um resolutions and and andrew will second them um so I will put the um I will put uh 11 a and b and I'll ask that that be put um as a division yeah so that's the easiest way can you put a and b separate too thanks well maybe for a but I don't support b tim and catherine can you hear okay yeah you're fine so this is for resolution uh 11a sorry nobody um voted against I mean I i can add that yani votes against yeah okay yeah yeah so I'll make that clear when I get to you councillor hanson thank councilman mcdonald no councillor johansson yes for both 11 a and b no just my vote recorded against 11b councillor galloway councillor daniels councillor coker councillor chan mayor aye councillor scandret councillor major is not here councillor keown that's look off no hansel davidson lakota hi councillor chu no and deputy mayor turner yes sorry can I just clarify with um cancer was that an eye I'm not sure why the officers sorry that's 12 votes four and at 12 votes four and four go four votes against thank you that's carried and I'll put the balance of the resolutions all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much and that is a record and I declare the meeting close uh councillor daniels would you like to before I declare the meeting close would you like to end with a current career please given that it has been a short meeting I'll do a short cut here from a short elevation um thank you and I'll declare the meeting close thank you very much you
Uh the next is the waikoura linwood central health community board and we've got alexandra davidson and michelle no not michelle today hello um and uh and community governance manager grace it's david's not davidson I'm not related oh my goodness I don't think I'm terrible do you know it's it is actually written down in front of me as davidson I literally read it out so I do apologize no I should have known because it is correct at the top and then not correct where I read it out from so I apologize no worries at all um thank you so much for having us today in kyoto um so the community board have made obviously a number of decisions over the last month and I will take the report as read and just speak to a few of them um we have the approval of the curve build-outs on linwood avenue um to us as pedestrians crossing linwood ave at poe toy toy we have our discretionary response fund contributions to the summon escape ramp project um the community market party project costs um also the confirmation of the board's comments on the christchurch cathedral reinstatement resource consent application and we do have one part a today and that is number item 15 and that is the te ara ehutai christchurch coastal pathway months bay section um it's all pretty straight forward we are just asking council to approve the adoption of the speed limit changes and um also that the delegator that the detailed traffic resolutions required for implementation of the project are referred to the chair and deputy chair of the urban development and transport committee um we had our principal's breakfast in february and I must say it was one of the best the board has had and there was a lot of really great discussion around the table we met with principals from the ward area to give updates and be updated around the work that is happening within our schools we had sarah cooper a community travel advisor there and she explained the walk or wheel to school day in the school travel planning planning program that any school can access and there is work quite a bit of work that goes in behind it but it's really great for the safety of tamariki um the principals discussed poe toitui developments um child poverty was something that was brought up by dick edmondson and something that is very prevalent in our area we also discussed the quality of counsellors and mentors in schools this is something that they feel is lacking in their schools at the moment and they're seeing the effects of not having those um counsellors or mentors available for these children um and they also praise the work of the swimming and schools program which is run by the christchurch city council team so that was fabulous um the it's been brought to brought to the board's attention that the safety around the garlands road and radley street intersection does have safety issues and this is owing to a temporary traffic management plan that is in place and um previously and its business as usual state could be improved um we wanted to raise the matter of temporary traffic management across the wider woolstone area work sites that are going on um now this is an nzta road um we have asked for advice but we haven't had any constructive feedback and we are just waiting for the next crash to happen in that area so we just wanted to bring it to the attention of cancer um moving on to a cycleway proposal that we've had a member of our community spoke with the green in the east working group about a proposal to join up the cycle way at worcester street and the river corridor at stanmore road um the idea yesterday was presented to the urban development transport committee and um the board wishes to support this proposal so it makes sense um it is a wide road and it is used by cyclers regularly um okay so we last weekend we had the estuary festival which is obviously an annual um event in that area it's really fantastic it has a environmental theme behind it so everybody obviously gets together we have a beautiful day of live music food stalls but it's also a really great place so that was a really successful community event um moving on we have a whole bunch of events coming up this month I feel like march is events month um so we obviously have polyfest coming up this weekend we have the kids hub annual children's market we have the philips town gala the avery gala the wilston garlic and the residence forum and um this saturday after polyfest we also have the fresh uptown boogie down event which will be held at the art gallery from 7 p.m um really excited about this one this will end up being the after party for polyfest so it looks really fun we obviously have this weekend the um memorial services as well so a lot going on for our ward and in christchurch but thank you thank you very much it's very good um would someone like to move the report they received sarah seconded are there any questions comments are you a question or a comment just to record a question um just in regards to the letter that we've seen um around ferry road the right-hand response from nzta no no so I just wonder if like it just seems really weird that it was an urgent request that's been going back to about july last year um oh yeah there were so we had a resolution through council to support the advocacy team before then though I mean we've had zero responses no I don't think we've had zero response I'm pretty sure that they've indicated that there are more challenges with that than just the straightforward answer I don't know be good just uh I mean I don't know if it's helpful for the council to re-raise it or to support the board but can we ask the chief executive to raise it directly with nzt yeah yeah I think that would be really helpful thanks just so we can close it great thank you great yeah all right and maybe the other one as well the garland's road yeah that would be fantastic it would make sense that's always an issue sorry yani but when you've got a state highway and it does mean that when the community board recognises that there are local community challenges and this is obviously been raised with you by the community yeah uh you know that we we need a much smoother pathway to um to having those conversations with nzta so we'll get the chief executive on to that cool thank you yeah that was going to be my second question was around now that ctop has been disestablished the process around doing a temporary traffic management plan approval because that's really what's at the heart of some of the concern is that you've got a state highway local roads look I've just said that the chief executive will take it up so if you've got more background information that would be helpful in terms of informing the chief executive but I'm sure staff are aware of the issues and um and we can get the chief executive briefing with ctop but who's the new people I will deal with it as requested by the man yeah we're not going to answer questions like that the question and nor does anyone off the top of the head so we'll get you an answer on the um proper line of questions yeah and just a brief comment um melanie um it was just a bit about the residence forum I just wondered can you explain quickly what that is so we have a regular residence forum for the central city and fringe residence groups and community groups to raise issues talk through relevant consultation engagement that's happening cool very good um yani you'd like to make a comment just to say that we we really need to look at how we approve temporary traffic management plans and particularly around signage and speed like it's really um seems to be different levels depending on um whatever reason um but basically it just seems to be a gap around people understanding how to communicate what's happening and there was in one of these places there was a um an accident uh that that I saw with a cyclist um I guess the the bigger issues would be resolved through the brom corridor um and that would be a really good opportunity for the permanent staff but if there's anything that can be done in the interim I just think it's really urgent these concerns have been raised for several months now and um you know it's just it's a really uh popular route of kids accessing and parents accessing the school walking to the local school because of the other stuff that's closed so any support we can get on just trying to look at those issues would be very much welcome I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye hi those opposed say no that's kerry thank you so much thanks very much the next is the waipapa
I don't know why it's called item three but the draft long-term plan um uh 2021 to 31 and uh I'm just going to run through the procedure for today as I said at the beginning this is the reconvened meeting regarding the draft long-term plan and on the first day of the meeting we passed a number of resolutions subject to the inclusion of the auditor-general's report we now have the auditor general's report together with the letter of representation to be signed by myself and the chief executive the consultation document had been updated to reflect the comments made by audit new zealand prior to the auditor general's report being um provided and these documents are available to have been made available to uh councillors prior to the meeting um so I've got uh council officials at the table but I wondered whether andy burns whether you'd like to come and join us at the table as well and from audit new zealand to present the the report and answer any additional questions so the issues for today's meeting as we attended to the other matters the other day okay welcome welcome yes please oh okay so thank you thanks for that you need to have the excuse me the audit's complete um um we've got an ordered opinion for you that's the most important thing and what does that mean uh it means that we are comfortable that your consultant consultation documents appropriate for consultation and it also means that we've looked at this supporting evidence that sits underpinned it but underpins that that cd is also appropriate for consultation the opinion is essentially clean with with one national exception and there's what we call the nemesis of mata in the audit opinion and that is simply and as I say it applies to all councils drawing attention to what you all know which is there are some water reforms coming over the hill and that might have significant implications for all councils at this point in time the plan assumes the status quo and and tells the the the right payer that this is all happening so we're simply drawing attention look this is important look at it uh it doesn't anyway detract from the document I suppose it tells you that there may be another one coming something coming later on um but that's after due process has been observed so that's all I want to say your worship the audit's done it's a it's a clean opinion subject to that but that's not an unclean it's simply a reference to uh something that's going on so the second statement the consultation document was prepared as if these services uh will continue to be provided by the council but future decisions may result in significant changes which would affect the information on which the consultation document has been based um that that's a statement that's literally going into every consultation document around the country to the best of my knowledge there may be an uh regional council here and there that doesn't get that reference depending on the answer to which they touch sorry that's right and and it is appropriate that we um prepare it on don't simply have um a stare from central government about what that final decision will be I think that's a view taken across the sector that it's appropriate to do it that way good thank you um did you want to say a few words yeah I'll just hand over to the chief executive she did want to mention something to you okay thank you mayor uh andy we just wanted from our officer perspective to thank you for working with us all the way through the period it is absolutely right that the council has taken a very deep look at what it's been doing and you've been engaged in that and I'm grateful that you've been able to see how we how far and deep and wide we have gone you've recognized it and you've helped us to be able to get through the wellington hot house work this is normal and we're grateful for that thank you okay thank you it's always an interesting ride and a good robust discussion so that's cool I week uh I i was uh I wasn't entirely at 100 sure that we would get to the meeting today um but thank you very much for all that you've done to assist us to meet our obligations and enable us to confirm matters so that we can proceed to the timetable that we've seen really appreciate it thank you pleasure oh yanni has a question for you I just had one question if you looked at the cost of the new multi-use arena and whether you think the consultation docu accurately reflects the increase associated to that as part of looking at the underlying information we look at the support information that supports the financials so we have looked at um whether the information used in the financial model is is the latest available and come to the view that it is if that answers your question yep yeah I mean I'm just concerned that there's additional spending going in because of the stadium that's not explicitly called out in the consultation document not to our knowledge um the one thing we do cost more than an original estimate as far to the best of my knowledge the information in the plan or in the sporting information is consistent with the available information this point in time perhaps I'll ask that of staff because I mean this was raised as well sorry I think that young is raising the question about the um the costs associated with the transport changes in and around so it's not the project in order to deliver the project it's not just transport it's there's some waste stuff water stuff there's about 33 million extra as I've calculated it which has all been debated as we've gone through various things okay so the question is does every element of the change to the capital program need to be highlighted in the consultation document now council decides what it wants to put in the consultation document there is a program that has been previously consulted on and engaged with government on uh these things aren't and the the cd the whole program is in the cd in terms of in to pull up unless you wish to specific changes yeah and we we haven't chosen to do so so thank you any other questions all right look thank you very much it's very much appreciated that you were able to come today as well and um and to hear our great gratitude thank you for all of the hard work that you and your team have done so do pass that on okay thanks thank you all right so now we'll move to the um to the resolutions and uh I did send out a wii note before just to let you know that we've broken down the last resolution so the first resolution is to receive the report and authorize the second one is to authorise the mayor and chief executive to sign the letter of representation and then having received the auditor general's report formally adopt the information and that provides the basis for the draft ltp and the consultation document now these were um two elements that were uh voted against by some councillors last time so I'll put the consultation process which nobody seemed to object to last time so I'll I'll put that in with 9 10 and 11c so is that all right all good so um this is a very minor thing and it's around the three waters reform in the in the document and it's on page 16 when it says we will be consulting with you on this later this year I think it'd be quite good if that was written in bold so that people don't get confused and there's just a small thing that I'm saying and the consultation documents itself we can deal with we can deal with that because I mean I agree with you people people do need to know that we will be coming back to consult later in the year um you don't need a resolution but I can do the legislation hasn't been passed yet so yeah um yani um just also on the rubbish recycling and organics and the actual um submission form it doesn't state that it's a legal requirement that we it just asks if we've got the balance right and it talks about the changeaway culture changing our throwaway culture and reducing the amount of

don't need a resolution we can um uh make um that's probably just a few final amendments it's probably just and then you got I mean you know about my concern with the stadium or the multi-use arena so yeah I still can't understand why that isn't called out when other projects that are way less we haven't_''_597.04 we haven't resolved to include it within it so um I I'll move these um resolutions and and andrew will second them um so I will put the um I will put uh 11 a and b and um I'll ask that that be put um as a division yeah so that's the easiest way can you put a and b fine so this is for resolution uh 11a I'm sorry nobody um voted against I mean I i can add that yani votes against yeah okay yeah just sort of being recorded against it yeah so I'll make that clear when I get to you councillor hanson thank you um so councillor templeton hi councillor mclennan uh aye mcdonald no councillor johansson yes for both 11 a and b no just my vote recorded against 11b councillor galloway councillor daniels councillor coker councillor chen the mayor aye councillor scandret all right councillor major is not here councillor keown that's lego no hansel davidson councillor no and deputy matana yes sorry can I just clarify with um counselor kian was that an eye jake had a membership for that's sorry that's 12 votes four and at 12 votes for and four go four votes against thank you

The bi-monthly transport report oh mr chair I'll take the reporters read there's nothing in particular I need to bring to the committee's attention this time around but I do have all the relevant transport managers here mark pinner who's the maintenance manager stephen thomas operations and lynette who does capital delivery and ltp excellent we'll go straight into questions y'all need your questions oh thanks several actually um so the just concerned about the bollards the high cost of the bollards and the fact that we don't get any governance say in in that process um so obviously in here it just says that they're going in so there's no opportunity for us to consider the costs associated with what's reposed the costs were approved as part of the annual plan and we're delivering on the annual plan so for like smaller things we would get a report that said there's the options here's the costs but we haven't had that for the bollards and I don't quite understand briefings on the bollards but them require community board decisions some of them require committing decisions some of them require decisions of council this one was decided by council via the annual plan and we've had two briefings on it and that um opinion of the council when we briefed you last was to certainly continue with delivery of the bollards and that's what we've done well it was because we took a straw poll and it was it was clear through the briefings we had that there was guidance to go down this for these bollards and it was put through the annual plan process it's just a one-line item where their budget was increasing right it's the question's been answered so just I just want to check on the cycleways so the um the pawaho river road the it's great that you've said that there's some funding available now to coordinate with the land jonas program how's the best way to access that funding for um particularly the kiwi rail opa um bridge because that's an area where we've got land think about um some of the the synergy between works that's currently happening there's also I mean there's quite a strong community desire for that opala road richardson terrace area village area to be enhanced through the craft funding so it would just seem sensible to try and get some preliminary design work in that location so we have brought enough funding forward to an undertake preliminary design work not construction work so there is money to do design work to ensure that we are aligned and it has been done and it is being done in the appropriate community boards they've been briefed if they've been asked so that's been happened the response I got back was the cycleway is not going to be constructed to 2025 and there isn't it isn't and no decisions have been made and secrets we can't_''_206.959 do any construction until we've had it I'm not talking about the construction I'm just talking about the design so it's incorporated into we are starting the design and figuring out the route but route so we're trying to understand what the land drainage team and the impact that the land drainage team has on the banks of the river and how that impacts what we can or can't_''_229.68 do as part of the cycleway but that's the level at which it is it's not down to a specific point under a specific bridge so the bridge you've mentioned as as you're aware a kiwi rail bridge that is being replaced um so they are replacing the infrastructure across the river that is the project that we have no role in now I understand the desire to coordinate but we don't have money to do any construction works or coordination down there until 2028 and it might not be where the route goes because it's not fully determined years um this the third question sorry the third question you raised was about craft the craft prioritization conversations will be coming back to each of the boards as we've talked about in all of the processes so the team will be coming back to the board 2 this is on page 15. it says the final consent for the work has been lodged contract documents are being prepared I know that there was also an engagement consultation on the proposal to change the road it still has to come back to the committee so if if the road proposal doesn't go through does that impact on the consent yes potentially so would we not be better to resolve that issue first before we launch the consent only if we're going to ask you to resolve an issue sorry only if there's there is a change proposed so but it does have to come back okay I don't know how others feel but I'm a little bit concerned do you know from that engagement what the feedback has been today is to not change the the clear feedback has been to not change the um use of that stream yeah that that's what worries me when are we going to get uh we will get it we'll get a report back on that but there's been clearly when are to cheat with the team but it should be in the next couple of months okay thank you could you just update it before I need it before committing yes please I guess that yeah do you understand the issue though is that we've lodged the consent and in the meantime the consent will be processed and may we just see that may have an impact well I don't I don't know what the hell they've lodged the consent so okay yeah I've just asked for lynette just to give us an update so your feedback oh okay cool just two other questions one is um I've I've sent round through the the future streets are report that that was done and uh you know there's been a lot of stuff happen since it was complete but it's a really good report and I was just interested to get a staff response memo some some advice back on how we could actually incorporate the findings of that report into our work programs and I'm not quite sure the best way I don't know his future streets was not our report as in transports report and it's not even a council report it was actually funded by nzta and it was a study that was undertaken um with hayata college and um the campus there and a number of other community groups a fully agreed counsellor there's a great report that is and that has been um feedback to the community board I believe it's the community board needs to bring it back to council to feed it into the long-term planning process it hasn't come back to our board um but regardless um so the best thing is what you're saying is get community awards to come to council asking for action on it it needs to come back as a community board priority it's not it's not our report we we provided information to support the report but it's not ours okay no that's cool I think and um phil and james sort of heard that so I think you guys could sort of take a bit of a yeah well I mean I also present some of that area too so I'll work with you guys and we'll get something um and just finally the real-time information system seems to be not working um I'm really concerned that we've now got a new system but we've had no briefing on it as best I can tell so I did put this question ahead can you just give me some sense of um what's happening with our current real-time information uh is it working is it functional uh and do we have any idea about the numbers that are not working and the cost of repair until we get the new system in and then the new system that's proposed what is it um and how can we have assurances that that money has been well spent and not just on another system that's going to cause issues going forward like we've seen with the previous one so for those who are not familiar with it the public transport real-time information system is jointly managed but by ecan and christchurch sort of information to the bus traveller you're correct it is uh it is at the end of its life and is at risk of significant failure so um but what we've also found is that a number of those systems are no longer used because people have apps on their phone and it's just not simply necessary for us to replace all of those rti systems across the entire network so what we've done and we have populists and numerous I think we've updated the committee quite regularly on this process but we've entered into a new contract with nec and they've got international experience and delivery of these sorts of systems and we will replace about 100 of them there's about 350 at the moment we'll replace about 100 of them at the key locations and then there's a number of other ones which can be recalibrated I think there's about 60 or 80 70 can be recalibrated under the new network so you'll end up with less but they will work better and they will so far better system more up-to-date but you're correct the existing one is passed it's used by date and needs to be replaced no no screens and then there's the old ones no it's it's it's past past end of life and this need to be replaced and it was one of the things that got um indicated as part of the pt futures uh work as well so it was a recommendation that that be replaced but that was already intro so I guess that leads the question um if it's not working should we just turn it off and tell people rather than people get incorrect time when buses are coming um it will be replaced imminently and I think the best thing to do is we are still managing the system as it currently stands it's not perfect but I would I wouldn't recommend getting rid of the whole system because it needs to both speak to the system on the bus but also the system at the bus interchange as well so there's three components to the bus and what sits at the bus interchange so I wouldn't recommend turning it off um but what we do need to do is get on with replacing it with the new system as soon as possible and we're doing that so when will we see the new system um hesitant to put an exact date on it but but we're certainly looking at um q2 q3 this year so this calendar year so I'm hopeful it'll be done by you know the end of q3 I mean I don't know how other people feel but it's just really frustrating for people when they go to catch the bus they push the button until the bus is coming in 20 minutes and it's a 10 minute frequency down the road or they go on the website and they get wrong information I think it's doing huge damage to two people catching the buses and you know another six months of that spoken to your points um thank you I've got two quick questions um 3.8 was the lowest styx um so I see there that the land drainage recovery project to naturalize the box drain is currently on hold and that that would be concerning the lamp the lamprey there no it's a different section of the drain they can't change that section where the lamprey are because they actually nest in the box so is it to the north or I think so yes and so why is that on hold is that budgetary or I can't answer that I'm sorry but will that not hold the project up okay that's fine and the second question is the gnarly old laguna gardens palm tree in um libra palms um well I've got you can I ask what's happening there uh there should have been memo which has gone out if it hasn't if you haven't received it already we're preparing it and um councillor major gave us a bit of advice which was very useful and that saved us saved us a bit of money um so we've taken that on board and and we'll replace last time around there was a specific issue around laguna and but the wider issue was around uh developers doing greenfield type subdivisions building roads and putting in place these sorts of things which we in here and they cause cost council so I know my question is about the repair job on that one because they're my constituents who are hounding me about it I haven't seen the memo have I missed it has it gone out it's coming it's coming it's coming okay and will there not will there be options or is it just one no just one option and it will be repaired okay I think you'll look forward to the memo yep cheers sarah thank you um just looking back uh a couple of minutes too a couple of things that yani mentioned the camera terrace rating change heathcote expressway I understand heathcote expressway is shovel-ready and time-sensitive for a range of reasons not just shovel-ready but lizards and bits and pieces um so having their report through would be great how to involve the community board now getting a briefing at the same time as councillors I don't know but we'll figure it out that would be really good um and the other one is the the kiwi rail bridge and while we can't do anything because there's currently no funding sitting until 2025 or later for that particular cycle way if the design work was but the workflow land drainage and the design work was advanced enough earlier in that council could make a decision to to shift some funding so I don't want the lack of funding in the budget for now to um to hold up sort of plans to do something so that section of road floods frequently it's a high use pedestrian area for kids getting to school that kind of thing and it would be good to have it sorted I understand that but we do also have to have the route yeah yeah yeah so once we start spending money on it not saying doing it now yeah but if that design once that design work gets done in the work with land drainage then year you know that we can make a small change there to get a section done um but it is a it's a really horrid area for people to pass through at high tide so yeah thanks sam just a quick one on 3.3 the craft um so it looks like it's all progressing well when we get that in the future this one's got the list will there be timelines on when that works going to be completed in terms of yeah yeah well that's part of the prioritization that they went through with the boards as well yeah so that prioritization on that prioritization stuff are we going to prioritize the work that doesn't need to be consulted on and an effort to get stuff moving quicker well that's nuts and bolts of the business case yeah we will be coming back as indicated we will be coming to back to the boards um who have craft funding over the next month or so maybe two with a few e2 doing some of the easy wins this financial year so that's the money spent by mid 2023 and that's certainly our intention to you know comply with what the business case said um and I think that'll be a discussion with the boards as to you know what they see as priorities and what they want done first I mean there is some stuff in there which may require and I'm thinking you know when you start removing car parks and other things for renewals around streets there might be specific consultation which is required for some projects other ones none at all so yeah we can get on with that and we've got the contractors in place to do it okay so do you have a sense of what that might look like in terms of split whether there's half that's going to be non-consulted and just got on with we will be able to bring that back to you and we can prioritize it around that and give you an indication of what stuff we think can just be done without further approvals or consultation and what staff would might need to go question on page 20 under paragraph 4.1 because this annual plan will increase 4.5 million dollars pretty good you know and start particularly emphasize a three-point or original maintenance rule yes but I'm concerned is because some similar law you know even receive but after the show period time then damage again poho earthquake so in here principle is very good in the particular star emphasize like to engage with the contractor ensure scorpion agreement work aligned with cancer expectation but I suggest the start should be the review each the worst particular situation some summary rule quite easy to receive all done but summer world because due to the traffic flow or heavy motor vehicle passes this one very very crucial important I would like to you know suggest each one need to review more more clearly detail yes otherwise just waste the money waste the time thank you council thank you erin I've got a few um first one because it come up at the disability meeting on monday was the disability car parks by the town hall on colombo street that were going to be the north they were on the left there's about three they're still not in place yet or marked is that waiting for the other columbus street consultation because I thought they were just north of I'm sorry it'll be south of kelmore yeah that's the bit that we have to finish so there are still construction works to be done there right and their construction works haven't been left oh yeah so that's yes it hasn't been it's going next month to the community board and then month after to council so after that so it's probably six months away to be here okay this year um now yes about this year yeah the uh other one is um the bus trial from uh when they did the um northern corridor the uh um the the free bus and stuff have we had numbers on the success or lack of for that I haven't had numbers I've only had discussions with environment canterbury and it sounds like it's been popular but um I haven't got any have thought that we have those but um that's all right uh but so they'll come at some point it'll show us what that well it's still pretty early days um given the particles over january which school holidays and traffic flows are different we don't like to do monitoring over that period but um they would have them uh but I think that they're at pains to kind of make sure they've got a reasonable uh handle on on what those numbers look like before they start reporting them yeah richard we also make sure that when we get the numbers on patrons we also look at the travel time savings that have been made on that route because of the express bus route compared to what it used to be so we can have a good look at everything yeah because I've seen a couple at peak time buses coming down there and to say they were empty with their compliment so they had like five and six people on each bus which was a concern I thought they were hereford street um lights that are over by the bridge there so that changing were they never planned or designed when the promenade was done because they're moving the control box and have cut a big track through all that really nice tile that was put down two years ago or maybe three years ago um that nice I don't know what it is slate or something which looks really expensive to replace quite a lot of it and I mean it's got a big asphalt patch through it now but I'm sure that won't be the final the light controls there probably is the intersection has been done as part of the the peripheral street upgrade yeah and we do have those slate tiles we are working with ocaro to get those so we have a range of them in stock so if things do need to be replaced we can go on given that that's now our asset we can go in and replace them so that that would be done as part of the hereford street upgrade right yes they are around christchurch as you remember the council's put more money into the and you'll plan a long-term plan for replacement of those because some of those assets are pretty old sorry excuse me yeah because it just it would appear that the um the design one you wouldn't have done that part and then changed it within a couple years so was that not no it wasn't done as part of the promenade that was the bit that was left out and came back to us to to deliver so the promenade went up to either side and we've had to drop the intersection as part of the bridge in the european street upgrade so that was left out and there was a report to council about that transferred from attacker to us our responsibility the bridge super sings us as we're doing that on behalf of otaku as well oh yeah okay and then um the madras uh litchfield street lights I thought um in a meeting a couple of weeks ago because the mayor had uh raised about turning them off and where the ride's been stopped that's been fixed which one so um we did pick up on that it was a briefing yesterday about the multi-use arena yeah and um essentially you are darling thank you thank you hey hey paper car phil um so those signals have been um fixed uh on an interim basis because obviously there's further work that will need to be done once the design of the stadium is further progressed right and you know they'll be that whole area around there will be upgraded and that's pretty detailed in that uh presentation we gave to um council yesterday so I can recirculate that if yeah so what's fixed so because they're all still there and still on so what does it mean it's still there and so on but um I think the issue stefan do you want to speak to it that's more your company so I think the concern was that they were impeding the flow of traffic and they weren't necessary so what the team's done is to make sure street um so that's now comes on um triggered over here yeah so but but in reality the um madras street is on a platoon anyway so as you move down the dress street it goes on the green wave so it only would the the lights of that intersection I've only held you I was like oh sorry I'll sit back down again sorry um is that better um yeah and so um it was I think so so it's on they're on the green wave anyway so some people were just going around the block so they'd go left in and then yeah yeah so they're the ones that would have been hell for it so what they're now is effectively on permanent green and unless someone comes from the side street to to call that that movement and then they'll go to read and let the person out of the side street also uh pedestrians also can can call them as well so right yeah okay yeah because unbelievably someone was watching the meeting and then contacting me still there yeah yeah so we haven't switched them off per se because obviously pedestrians still want to be able to get across the street so yeah okay that makes sense they did actually was their words they said the mayor said that they were it was there and it's been done yeah okay I'll tell them it's been done but it's not how they thought but it's exactly her and I'll tell him to re-watch this one more yes yes I don't I said the me is extremely powerful carefully um the cycleway along the um northern railway line how's that progressing because I get the odd question by people that it's really well yeah because that one's popular along the railway line and there's a there's a really popular gate track along railway line there isn't there yes yes yes um it is actually progressing well we are looking to um we're just about to award contracts for some of the bits that aren't on kiwi rail land which is getting started are offered in the section from sticks mill overbridge up to northward so widening that path so they can use the shear path up to northwood so that's going to get going um but we are also managing to progress very well with our designs that point it goes up main north road and then does it go cut back by the supercenter it actually stops at the supercenter right so it doesn't go through the new subdivision right okay so and then what that at that point that's when it'll start needing to connect into the local network right as that gets built and the bit on the rail corridor that's you know that's progressing well as well we we're just about at 100 designs with kiwirail and they've agreed to design so we are progressing and we've got an agreement for at least but we've got to have the designs agreed to get the lease agreed so it's a bit of chicken and egg but we are and it's going to check on an egg be this year did you see that we'll be starting the designs uh we'll be starting the um construction on the non-kiwi rail bits this year we are aiming to get construction started on kiwi roll land this year yes right right because I'm just going to put my hand in my heart and guarantee it well it just if the pressure needs to be on kiwi rail just the council um right to or get our mps to hustle up so as we mentioned it I think it was finance and performance committee last week um councillor turner did have a conversation with minister robertson and uh that he's realized realised benefit and that that we are working together and much more aligned right and and look here as an organization the priorities are a lot more focused in auckland to be fair there's a lot more going on up there um but it did help refocus priorities down here and we are seeing progress so it's good all right okay cool thank you and it's a shovel ready project as well okay thank you james uh 3.10 the downstream effects I just want to understand um the bullet first bullet point see where it says traffic counts currently indicate volumes have not reached pre-sea and northern corridor opening volumes is that a good thing or a bad thing I'm not sure what are you expecting the volumes to be greater than the opening volumes or they should be less than 3. 3.1 I have the first bullet point um traffic counts indicate volumes have not reached pre-cnc so look the main concern with the whole downstream effects was that obviously the cnc finishes at the cramford dennis intersection and there'd be a lot of dispersed traffic um running down local routes and and the scheme of the plan was really to um seek to dissuade people from doing that and keep them on cranford street so it appears that that is working from the information that we have there's certainly some streets which are experiencing an increase in traffic flows and we're continuing to monitor that um and as you'll see you know we've we ave and um etc 10 street um so yes you would have expected it to potentially be more but that was the whole issue that we needed to monitor as part of the downstream fix management sorry you're talking about the rat running rather than the cranford street is that right those that's right okay I thought you were talking about cranford street itself right you've just clarified it for me thanks phil guys just touching on the follow-ups with what janie said why do we have to get people in from overseas to put these in do have I read that right we've got to get installers from overseas yeah that's um can we I i know people that can dig holes actually yeah when we when we did the briefing at the end of last year we we showed you the um does it need special that yeah really okay has this vehicle mitigation okay um dyes pass road how are we sort of looking there just giving a wee update on how things are going can we not put an update on next time on that one it's a big big job sorry um it's progressing well um they're really starting they've I believe they've just about finished the inside works and they're about to start on the right on the outside they say the wall works next week I'm looking to get up there with kirk and do some then looking to do some videos so that people can see what's going on up there inside the closed site the traffic management seems to be improving we have had a few issues I'm just hearing that there's a few weird issues on the outside that could be with the stability of the ground on the outside of you no problem um and my old favorite here the old coastal pathway um what put that we've got the plants in that what just you might have told me once before what percentage of the path is cantilevered I'm just trying to get in my head how it is it's so expensive is 50 10 just a bit on only put as much cantilever in as we absolutely need yeah um it is the section between the christchurch yacht club yes and shag rock that has the potential to be keen to leave it but not all of it is and I can't_''_1955.2 put a percentage on it I'm sorry yeah but as far as the percentage of the rate it'll be a minor percentage a little bit and and the the nice stone rock wall around there I can't quite sit on it that's definitely stain don't know that the solid wall between the cars and the not necessarily oh really okay okay okay and um that's about it's not a it's not a heritage wall by the way sorry it's not a heritage item all right so it it could well be coming out that wall okay yep concrete I'll have debate stuff later excellent good to know and thank you thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions and clarify things a couple of things just wondering about the variable speeds along a road why stretch of road um quite uh stefan to speak to that one if that's okay in general or a specific there is well um this one that we're looking at monk spur there are changing speeds along there but there's also other roads throughout christchurch for example hallsville junction road it's a lot of different speeds along the air and just wondering understanding what's behind it yeah so so we we set the speed limits to the speed limits rule and also the speed management guide so it's basically speed limits are based on on the risk um and um and I guess uh ncta produces what's called mega maps which gives an indication based on the risk of the road what the speed limit should be we then um we then use that to and in conjunction with the speed management guide to see the speed limit um that that can result in as as a road goes through different environments the speed limit can change um and one of the things that nzta were trying to achieve under the last um uh less speed limits and be more consistent across the country so there's real emphasis on um 60s and 80s rather than 70s and 90s for example and um and so much so that under the under the guidance rule you have to get special dispensation from your zta to use those alternative speed limit so that's to try and reduce some of the confusion and the different types of speed limits um where I guess it probably impacts christchurch the most is as the speed limits that come in underneath below 50 and you've got your 30s and 40s which is um and as a general rule around that 40s are residential and then the 30s are in your your high um your sort of areas of with the place function high place function as well as a high number of concentration of active users as well so that's where you get your sort of town centres or yeah your little key activity areas which may be 30. and then the difference with that is obviously with the variable speed limits we have outside schools some work being done at a national level to try and change those 30s but I haven't had an update on that for a while so I'm not sure whether it's got to it's going to be quiet but does that sort of answer your question yep that's really great and as an area changes are they reviewed or what's the process what happens does it come through a community board that there's a need for a change or what happens there yeah it can come through any anyway come from a member of the public it comes through the community board my staff also identify areas we've done as you know we've done a number of speed management changes across uh sort of the key residential areas and we with those ones in particular we tried to based on the advice we got from the council councillors um a few years back we try to do it with where the residents want it um so where they they raise it so we've got um I think night stream and areas where that was requested by the by the um by the public and we've sort of followed that so yeah so it could come from any number of sources but we also the the mega maps that um that comes from zta highlights the the um the real high risk roads as well from a safety point of view and we've got a requirement to review those um on a regular basis thank you really helpful excellent all right someone want to move this report jimmy seconder pauline phil did you just talking about uh aaron and um the bus lanes and people not but using the buses have we written a paper the other day about how the ecan councillors were proposing free buses for two years why do they love putting up people's rights so I i I thoroughly support this I think this is great because we spend an absolute fortune on bus lanes and to see people going past past us on in buses with not many in it I think we if we if we want to put our on the try it out because if we don't try it we'll never know and I i think we should throw some money at he can and give him a hand to do it right just something I think of course I can we can afford it we'll get it from somewhere else and so I just I'd like to just say that we should we should encourage people to change the way they think and get on buses if we if we're serious about thinking about it and use the bus lanes that we're spending so much money for and from what I'm told and sarah might be able to tell me if we get five percent out of out of out of cars into buses it makes one hell of a difference does it just five percent so there is debate it is debate okay that's a good debate um the and the other thing I i can't understand at on this um on the cycle on the coastal pathway why we spent a whole lot of money on ashfield ash now dig out perhaps that rock wall and the curb and things it seems we're not gonna win any friends on that bit just saying thank you jimmy uh I would like to tell this opportunity particularly acknowledge the staff you know particularly in uh where the homeback area concerned also traffic issue by yesterday very very good staff have a five kind of staff you know wiring the specialist to have a presentation in our community but also we invited some kid community the leaders representative attend and also solar q and a they are all very satisfaction I think this is very good model you know we can continue working together you know to resolve this problem the other one particular hongbi high school company the primary school staff to help them you know to have established a school travel plan and also to undertaking the park smart program at least build up a very good foundation give those students and teaching staff are confident so just want to acknowledge the stuff regarding to this one yeah I want to thank staff for the report I have been briefed on the real-time information if you think about public transport and phil's touched on the free fares which is something that I've also supported in the past we need to improve what we're doing around public transport and one of the best things we could do is get integrated ticketing with a common technology across the country I mean it's quite silly at the moment that every council has their own system their own consultants spends a fortune on technologies that become obsolete so in terms of real-time information it would be fantastic to actually look at what other councils are doing and work in technology that goes across across the country so that we get synergy and savings it's been really disappointing to see that the current system is is broken um when we've invested so much for so long and I do know like greater wellington council they've had really good reporting on real-time information but um so so you know I just think that we we really should understand what's happening in that in that space because is it's all tied into the screens at the bus exchange the buses themselves and then what's actually on the on the corner on the on the footpath or on the bus stops in the communities so yeah I personally think we should be getting more information and then just to say that you know I think doing the route selection for our cycleways and being transparent around that is really critical we've heard from a community today who are putting forward suggestions but we're not able to share what we're considering in terms of route selection if we could work together with communities it's the same through the um a pawa headquarter area if we could work together around even the route selection and design process would be much better place I think than rather rather than duplicating a whole bunch of efforts or people not knowing what's proposed and proposing other things ah there's just too much I want to answer um so I'll take some of that offline the one thing so I said I just said so will do though is just talk to the one brief point about the asphalt down main road which was done as part of the repairs for the road to the port so a huge amount of work happened there and was done well ahead of any shovel really before covert and before shovel really funding at a time when the city council had the funding for the coastal pathway out in 2027 and 2028 and so the coastal pathway wasn't planned to be done for another 10 years which is why the road got done thank you aaron yeah I think the original major cycleways routes were all meant to be completed within five years so I can see where the confusion lies therefore and I just want to second phil's proposed motion around helping fund the buses I think it makes sense the only thing is that that should come from the money we're going to spend on the infrastructure and on the bus lanes don't put in those 23 kilometres of bus lanes until we know that more than 2.2 percent of the population out by doing the trial but certainly not for the two years they're proposing a lot shorter we'll soon find out whether anyone actually wants to catch the bus and I'm willing to run a book on or with all proceeds going to charity does anyone else want to contribute to this excellent debate on receiving a report yeah why not okay the the only thing I was going to say is I can't remember the numbers because I haven't looked it up but I had read that when the buses were free coming from wymac into the city there were less people on the bus than now when they have to pay thank you all those in favor anyone opposed karen um that would be counselor chien could you please close the meeting for karakia closely okay korea
All right so we've got um waikoura linwood central heathcote community board um alexandra davids and michelle lomax welcome for the first time thank you chair of the community board thank you uh kyoto koto thank you so much for having us here today and happy new year even though it seems like a very long time ago we have no part a's for this meeting um and I'd like to start by introducing um our new deputy chair michelle lomax we feel um really great that we finally have a complete board it's been a very long time um and we're looking forward to 2021 um I'd also like to say happy birthday to michelle um thank you alex what a great way to start the day um okay so moving on so um the first thing we wanted to raise is the um doris lusk play art so I wanted to let you know that there is progressing we have had some submissions for that as I understand it I'm one of I'm the board representative that will be it's been on budget and it's now being progressed so hopefully we'll be able to have a photo of um the board sitting astride the play out before too long and then just in terms of the um the usual discretionary response fund grants that we've been making both youth and cultural development um we held in a vent at the beginning of the year um cutting loose at cutler so this is cutler park which is in the woolston area um the event was run with the community board governance team and um they were assisting or sorry they were assisting kids hub to run the event and the space has been really under utilized and there's been a lot of complaints from the community leading to this point saying that they found it unsafe so we were looking at ways that we could bring the community together about 80 people showed up which was really fantastic it was a really casual informal day um and although it was cold we had a lot of children on the slip and slide it's way really fun day and we had a sausage sizzle and it was a really easy but effective way to connect with the community and look at what they want moving forward and we're happy to report that te paul toy toy um the linwood pool is progressing well which no doubt you as councillors will be aware um particularly noticeable the progress that's been made on it when we came back um after the christmas break and um happy to also be able to report that the noises that we were experiencing during um meetings with the early part of construction have um seemed to have reduced a bit so a lot of interest from the community on that one and there's also as you're probably aware a lot of work being done around engaging with the community about how they use the space so very pleasing um at the end of last year um I think I mentioned that we had an event coming up um the fresh youth event um so this was a collaborative event between christchurch city council and ycd um and including my fm we had approximately 400 people at this event so a smaller event but a really good turnout for um what we were expecting it was family friendly and it really shows that bringing together a lot of different groups to make an event happen is um helping our youth and community wellbeing um so we had dance offs we had haircuts we had sausage sizzles we had um the canterbury rams down there as well doing basketball um competitions so yeah it was fantastic and a really successful event so looking forward to more of those in the future um and this one is not really probably a matter that we as a community board can take much credit for but um just to note that the godwards are on their way to alaska and um we wish them a safe travels and look forward to seeing them again when they come back in september and it's rather a lovely photo too I don't know who took it but oh and I think I'm next so this um is a photo of an event the beginning of the street scape uh not the beginning sorry but it was around the streetscape for linwood village which is obviously extremely welcome and it involved um some staff members one of whom came back for from leave to um attend there were elected members and they were members of the community and we actually did a walk around and I felt like it was really quite useful just looking at the area that was going to be streetscaped and getting some helpful suggestions and really um pleasing that there is that um piece of work progressing and noting that it is a focus for the inner city east as a focus for council as well so I'm sure councillors will be pleased about that and we look forward to updating you further on that one all right um we've just got three more slides and they are just updates about events that are coming up so on the 27th of february from one till five we have the estuary fest um this is always a really well attended event every year um that's at we have the music at edmond so it is actually the sunday valentine's day so if you want away musical um event to pop down to that's 1204 and that is at the edmonds factory gardens um and then we have the bromley fair coming up that is the 20th of february um that's next weekend and that's always once again a really well attended community event the end right well just uh just to note that um when you finished at the bromley fair you could pop down to the south shore and see the celebrity councillor james daniels uh welcome people as they gather to farewell the godwards from south shore spit so um I i intend to go to that I usually go most years um it's a fantastic opportunity what one two um to see these magnificent birds before they commence their 14 000 kilometer journey with one stop on the way um in the china sea uh you know getting back to alaska to breed but to hear from park ranger andrew crossland who is a world expert on estuary internationally so and it's an opportunity to hear from him talk about one of his great passions which the god was and I i love the I love the um the maori name of course is the kuaka and there's a wonderful whakatauki and I'm sure james knows the actual word and maori but the the english version is that who has seen the nest of the koaka and so maori knew that they didn't nest here it's an extraordinary tale of of generations so no I'm not accepting your uh responsibility for for a journey that has been conducted for centuries so thank you very much has anyone got any questions for alexandra yes no just like to say to michelle happy birthday thank you pauline yeah james I remember being 40 as well what can I say I i I can't remember that far back no I was just I'll frame it as a question did while you were I don't I don't want to be territorial about this but um when you were talking about the farewell was a hangout at the bottom end of south shore in your ward oh dear we're not taking it away from you I had to make it into a question and then the other the additional thing is that while I will be there I am actually the support act for the main star which will be the mayor no andrew crossland no no you're you have to do a speech and I'm I'm just the warm-up act so many celebrities that's a fantastic thank you for mentioning them because um we had so much happening

and deputy chairs of the zone committees and thanks for giving up your time to come and talk to us today because I think it's really important that we're here straight from you so first off we have got the bank's peninsula zone committee gina welcome to the table morning thank you um so today I'm speaking in place of bonita wakefield who unfortunately has had to resign as chair due to health reasons so I'd just like to acknowledge her contribution as chair over the past two years she's done a lot to create a really warm welcoming atmosphere at our meetings where committee members and members of the public felt comfortable and encouraged to contribute we are lucky to have bonita continue on though as the runanga rep for wairiwa she's just wanting to slow down a bit right I will thank you for that please pass on our recognition for her hard work too yeah thank you and we'll be electing a new chair and deputy at our next meeting this month um I'd also like turner and staff who support us particularly ccc staff liz riley our secretary and marian schoenfeld who took over from peter kingsbury last year as our council representative overall the committee had a good year last year with minimal disruption from covet we approved four excellent projects from the immediate steps biodiversity fund and continue to have more projects put forward than can be funded each year we're very pleased to have been the first stone committee to co-author youth member with irena riddle completing her first year um now she was selected from the youth ropu we've continued to work through what is coming up to be our third year in our three-year action plan and the committee is looking forward to working to the new terms of reference following last year's review which aligns well with the direction that the committee has already been taking going forward the committee is trialing an approach that will focus our resources on three catchments for a set period of time likely two to three years rather than the previous approach which attempted to cover the whole peninsula and effect so we're hoping that by targeting our resources like this it will result in better qty outcomes from the mountains to the sea in the selected catchments and with better landowner and community engagement uh one community where we already have good engagement and a high turnout at the annual meeting that we've had there over the last few years is wai nui and would love to see that in other catchments I've already previously mentioned the septic tank study in wainway which was released in september last year but just to summarize again they found high levels of fecal contamination in the lower catchment um but with only minor contribution from human sources uh the majority being avian and to a lesser extent from stock though the human contribution may have been higher in wet weather interviews with residents found that many septic tank systems are old and uncertainty over council plans to reticulate wastewater in the area was means that many uh residents are reluctant to invest in maintenance or upk grades of their systems lastly I covered this in december but I'd be able to provide early end input into the ltp with a letter sent to council in november last year the committee's top priorities are biodiversity funding for immediate steps but also including bigger picture projects some examples would be similar to the banks peninsula trust's tea kakahu kahukura project to create a thousand hectare biodiversity hub in the southern port hills and road donald trusts efforts to purchase land above autumn bradley park that includes the summits of mount herbert and mount bradley implementation of the whaka aura whakaraopa catchment management plan in littleton harbour with emphasis on erosion and sediment control particularly roadside cuttings implementation of the waireawa sub-regional plan zipper recommendations including ongoing funding for the wiriword bank stabilization project to secure community and farm water supplies while retaining ecosystem health this includes funding preparation work towards a plan change to enable more realistic and responsive management of streams and water tax on banks peninsula as we are concerned that existing rules may not be sufficient to protect water quantity and its effects on ecosystem health now and into the future that ccc and e landowners on effective management of onsite wastewater systems as well as promoting mahangakai recovery through increased funding of fish barrier removal risk assessment for adaptation to climate change particularly in relation to freshwater ecosystem health and lastly weed management to protect biodiversity and that's all I have today that's all you have that's huge that's an incredible amount of work thank you very much hey look um just one question on the wine nui um because that is a big issue if people are not upgrading their septics and they're old because they don't know what our work program is so I wonder if we could get a memo through to the zone committee on what our intentions are in that work program whether we have funding in the ltp for wai nui or or a time frame of when that might be so that people have got certainty like if we're not doing it for 10 years people might upgrade if we're intending to do it soon then they might wait because that's a that that's obviously is that stream as well and some of it um do you want to answer that shall we take a seat the study what happened when there was no rainfall so it might have been that if it had rained at the time of the study the human sources might have been greater in terms of the evidence but I was just thinking rather than sending the zone committee a memo the zone company already knows at the city council is very unlikely to be doing any kind of articulation there for at least 10 years or more it's more the local community that needs to know and they may have they may have already been told through the community board or through the city council staff so you'd rather be sent it through to the community board and ask them to advise the community yeah okay that's great thank you for that guidance if there's no other questions we can move on to the next oh sarah thank you so much just that that we list at the u head at the end of things that you more funding through that's not in the actual report that was just an additional wheelis yes so that was a letter that was sent in november um as a and just checking process wise do the zone committees get to submit on the ltp don't think so no no because they're committees of council okay so we need to maybe have the zone committees coming in a similar way that um the community boards do so the community boards are committees of council and they get discipline so we need to work out some way of having better um and more formal input I think from the zone committees I think it would be good if they could can we can we get some clarification on that david with the zone committee's that would be great thanks sarah it seems crazy that they can't thank you I'm I'm really impressed that you've got your um a youth member and you're the first zone committee to do that what was the process did she approach you or how did you how did our meetings and base uh actually two youth members from the rap who did um and yeah it was just through discussions um between committee members and and and and we then sort of took the initiative to um create a role um and I i think it was christchurch yeah as well as that the staff involved in the ekin youth will poo helped work through the process and helped to ensure that the young people you know would be a good environment for them and and figuring out transport and things like that but with the vancomy review process last year it'll now be that all zone committees can have a youth member and they just have they're exactly the same as every other member of the committee with exactly the same yes there's one other already has so that's good thanks very much thank you oh sorry phil thanks guys that's great is there any chance of being able to go and have me have a look at that um near river recharge thing to see sort of how it works and that but it's on the that's another zone committee oh sorry so I've gone too fast sorry all right I'm here all day and that's the cell in waikato yeah okay thanks very much gina thank you uh christchurch miss melton kevin brown welcome to the table top that I'm sure you will no um this report's fairly brief um I gave a uh summary of the annual report at the last meeting so in between then and now there's been only one meeting since the previous report this was in february it was really interesting meeting it was a joint meeting that we held between the three zone committees with christchurch west melton selwyn and banks peninsula and we had this joint meeting to share experiences and to discuss the new purpose and functions which together with the three council's priorities to share experiences about successful products and how they became uh successful and how they were undertaken to hear about uh te mana awai and essential fresh water national policy statements 2020 and things like that and to learn ago the zone committee paid a three-hour visit to the otakai kino waterway this year the zone committee has decided to make this waterway a priority for a majority of its immediate steps funding we had representatives there from the local runanga the isaac conservation trust ecan seas city council water and the water and wildlife habitat trust and we heard about the cultural significance of the water in mexico the work that the isaac trust is doing and maintaining pathways and walks in the area the ecology of the river and the use of the land under lease from ecan the committee last year had voted to suggest to ecan that the land that is currently under lease is leased out to farmers for grazing and the motion was that it be moved from grazing to conservation to protect some of the plants and other biodiversity present in the area we met in early february with clive appleton from the council here to firm up plans for the zone committee to help with consultation processes for the stormwater management plan for their powerhog heathcote catchment jointly with clive we display boards and things like that the consultation process has now been pushed back to after the mid-year but the concept of how to get this consultation going is now in place it was pleasing to see that there's been some movement in research into the correlation between low levels of nitrate in the drinking water and colorectal cancer recently publicized research was the first step in looking at this link as I understand it and I haven't seen the actual paper yet it was a study to see if the data was available and if if it was possible to actually do the correlation um in any event it made headlines and kept the issue in the public eye and um this council actually wrote to the minister and got this actual research going it's it's extremely important for christchurch because christchurch's drinking water could be affected to the point where nitrate levels are high enough to actually cause some problem if it correlates with a study which was done in denmark um just before our next meeting this month we'll be signing can looking forward to that and finally our meeting at the end of this month is planned to be a workshop to put together an action plan for the committee for the next three year period and this is part of the re-jigging of the zone committee's purpose and functions as decided by the merrell forum so that's all I have it's been a holiday time and we've only had one meeting you know that that's huge work thanks kevin and um there's good news about the nitrates study so that's been given the go ahead to actually do our own one yeah here um and you don't have any idea of the time frame for that no I don't unfortunately I'm trying to find out a bit more about it um it just came out in the newspapers a couple of days ago yeah and that is really important yeah it's a joint study ultimately I think the department of health is a joint study between victoria university and otago medical school so I know that in our suggested a level of 1.8 what do you see as an acceptable level um the danish study proved a significant correlation between colorectal cancer and nitrate levels of 0.85 so it's um definitely lower than that level 1.8 yeah and that's a it was a huge study it was a um 1.7 million people followed for 35 years so it's um it's amazing yeah and we we can't use it because they say it didn't really relate to our environment in there oh well we need to find out that so hopefully this research will be done that I mean there's uh data around for whereabouts this cancer is uh prevalent and uh if it correlates with high natural nitrate areas which we know then that's all we're asking for you you have a well don't you yes I don't drink our water no you distill it redistill it yeah we can't drink our water that varies between where I'm in west melton and it varies between about five and 12 depending on the time of and there's there's a huge number of uh farmers properties in the canterbury plains that all rely on these wells most of them aren't analyzed and most of them don't know well I think we've done a good good thing getting those letters off the zone committee instigated that this council picked it up supported by you can and we've got some action happening so that's a good news story I know yannI's got a question to someone jake did you have one or over this sorry aaron signoni do you have a question just with the danish study is there water similar to ours as in does it get filtered for 1600 they have yeah they have varying levels of nitrate um and they just follow those levels through for the 35 years and it's a similar sort of um similar sort of country I guess they have a lot of agriculture right so that applies to the shallow bores but not our deep ones where it's the aquifers of running water that's 1600 years old type thing shallow bores are the main problem at the moment but um the some modelling numerical modeling by ear can show that water is coming through from waimekariri district which is going to have higher nitrate and this will end up in some of the deeper bores ultimately the more you more water you take out of the deeper bores you'll be dragging in some of that surface water into into those deeper bores so ultimately I mean it might be 20 50 years away but something you got to look at now sorry no no no that's a guess it could be it could be a long time for it to get there but if the council is moving to more uh deeper bores then you'll lower the proof and more water will be coming in to fill up the uh of course it will be moving to deeper pools to get away from the pollution yani and then leanne um uh um I'd like to say irrigated deering but uh that's not my field and it's agriculture in horticulture it's it's we want to get on yeah uh don't know sorry I do all I know is that um our values at home are quite high and we're not alone in this I um I have kit for measuring uh nitrate and stuff at home so uh I do neighbors and some people further away and some of the values are all quite high okay thank you for nitrate levels yeah the the nitrate levels the the drinking water levels in new zealand are set by basically they accept the who drinking water levels which are set at approximately 11.3 50 parts per million of nitrate or about 11.3 parts per million of nitrate nitrogen so the zone committee can advocate for those levels to be altered which you are doing in which the government's also looking at through the future that's right yeah and was there was a lot of controversy at the reach of a recent national policy statement about nitrates and so um it's it's um it's been looked at at the moment about you can do I guess that's not a statutory document so it doesn't overrule it doesn't sit higher than plans and national policy his own committee's reckoning I i mean the key the key driver would be what happens when the study comes out I guess that's right even evidence-based yep then I just kind of wanted to acknowledge the fact that that you had raised this um and and it came up at one of these reports that you'd written to the ministry of health um and back in 2019 I followed that up with uh correspondence on behalf of this council in relation to the precautionary approach the government as you know has established a task force to investigate the relationship of nitrates and I've got a briefing here at the council this friday and I just wondered whether I should make the offer available to um to yourself to to come together to the briefing it's just at four o'clock on friday uh with um uh dr tim chambers who's one of the uh well he's a senior research fellow and a member so I just given that it's just so close and we've been following up on this as a result of you raising it you're one of these reports which has actually emphasized the significance of the reporting process that we instituted um yeah that'd be that'd be great I'd love to come along too so dave could you send that through to kevin please sir in the details thanks leanne thank you very much and of course the the christian west melton zone committee is very focused on stormwater work and improving our contaminants or removing our contaminants at source and our urban environment and I love the picture here you've got of evan smith with him being presented as a stormwater hero and that's that's a great project the stormwater heroes so that's awesome yeah evan was um actually uh kind of an ad hoc member on one of our working groups so we we miss him a lot yes we all do yeah I i could add speaking of evan um this weekend is the grow event at stormwater superheroes display there which will include a very hot off the press the stormwater superhero mobile resource is being picked up today from the engineers oh really and so it will be there and that was kept that was evan's idea that mobile resource it will also be at the community water partnership launch um if and if you don't mind I'll just mention that the process for finding new committee members is coming up which happens annually and it will be advertised but it will be opened you know the advertising period will be between the 12th of april and the 10th of may so it starts the day after ltp consultation ends and then there will be workshops for the panels to you know meet the applicants and go through the appointment process and that will be from the 17th to the 28th of may and that would um involve the councillors on your the city council councils who are involved in those zone committees right well thanks for the heads-up it comes around quickly doesn't it and that um stormwater mobile resource absolutely not not that long what four years or something I don't know but it's a wonderful educational resource isn't it to show people what happens to your stormwater and everything that you put down your that's right stormwater pipe goes into the river and it's the city council who's paid for most of it ecans perhaps put in more time but the city council had more of the money and a number of community groups have helped design it yeah well let's all get down there and have a look at it because it's cool hey thanks very much guys I'd like to welcome liz von holler from the salwan waikouro zone committee nice to see you liz thank you uh tayora ola um I for the ones who don't know me I'm losing hello I'm um kaimuki representative from sao mahora plus other zones I am the co-chair there um with fiona mcdonald she um seems to apologize nicely committed to work um I like to also at this stage of knowledge um uh councillor galloway unfortunate that your committees hold on the tuesday and the same time as the houses so she's unable to get to the motion but then when we have other things outside at times you endeavor to get there um as you see in their uh 2020 annual report last year we did a lot of community engagement and talking to the community about their concerns we used the information through our new action plan for the next three years which we did just recently last month and it was and the activities we did last year um fits well with the changes to our terms of reference we hosted several public meetings that collaborated the support community members doing great work and it gave them the opportunity to tell us what else they needed a lot of um talk and community convectors about the drinks and wells and the nitrates in it we've been inundated with that request how how they um can have their wells tested um at this stage they're paying for our own pocket and and having to pay for their own filters and about the expense of having their drinking well everybody's entitled to fresh drinking water we report it to you four times a ccc four times and will now uh be doing the same to ecan and and um so in district council um there's a new concept to come in for them as well that we report four times a year instead of just the ones also we light down to try and change the personnel who doesn't presentation instead of falling down on me all the time yeah to do this because that gives a better outlook and perspective from across the board yeah that's good we import um we attend an important project uh opening vents in our zone and one of them was the air water recharge I'll talk to you when you asked a question on it on that one and we show uh the support and encourage these to put um you know we participate fully on them uh we we recommend over a hundred thousand dollars for uk and biodiversity um through the media steps um funding over the members and ron paulo and um and uh ellen lynn um we have to have uh that makes us quite short on on the ground was always one short anyway so now we're three short sometimes it's hard to get a um quorum at our summer meetings but the refresh is coming up within the next couple of months so we're hoping we actually have no farmers on board at the moment or nobody from the farm industry even so we're hoping to get some farmers on board because really it is a farming area so we need that on our committee I hope it doesn't turn back the way it was all farmers but never mind we'll get there oh we nearly finished our uh our new action plan uh we we think our five priorities uh will align with with the suggestion priority from your council ecan and so on district council in our plans we committed to facilitate a community-wide approach and I think that's what we need and because a lot of people in the community don't even we from within so we've hoping to push our further out into the community in fact we haven't had a uh meeting at southern district council in over two years so we've had all our meetings out in the community maybe a lot more at lincoln now than other communities but we are out and about so just unfortunately we have meant to have our uh meeting two weeks ago at uh the power of morky at a time or two but with covet uh coming over that we had to cancel that and that was mainly gonna be on and the cultural aspect of a region um but unfortunately we had to cancel that we will fit in a later date um he had done a lot of work on uh over the last two years on the uh the waikiri theory uh I'm sorry the waikiki why uh I'll do it sorry I'll go back again there's two two rivers side by side the white cherry carry uh sarwin rivers we've done a lot of work on that we've come to the innovator working group and they've failed a lot of recommendations back to us and then we uh just coordinating them at the moment and going back to council is and so where already need our support in that we support the action of the restorer of tiwara we want to retry and restore it back to some sort of healthy state and the only way we can see that happening is we have to clean up all the trevor trees first to stop the contaminants get into the lake and once we start that we then can concentrate on how we clean the lake up because it's pointless trying to clean the lake up first then clean up the treasure trees um help the water will help to raise awareness about private water drinking we've already gone through that and I think that's a very important one I mean we do have people uh especially down the sowen hearts which is right right down the low end of the uh water line and that's where there is a lot of concentrate of of words like assist with investigate a team or host that one of those ones we do attend a lot of the school plantings and community in their area would go out and just have chats with them we actually plant plants from them as well collaborate promote sandler represent the two and one was coming up in the very near future is the field day at kuri we're going to be out there and make sure we have a good presence out there and get our messages out there and I think that's a very another important thing we've got to get the message out and do some recording if they don't understand they want help uh send letters to wherever we've got to send letters to we're going to do a lot more of that we're going to develop a lot more advice through our workshops and and stuff like that especially we had a drop in um series on farmers uh but they with climate 19 they sort of went backwards that one but we will start those type of center council for your ongoing support for our committee and also request continuing con conversation um with us about the future role of these times and great times to come oh thank you very much what a great report it's really interesting reading I'm sorry wee bit squeezed for time today but and I know phil wants to ask you about a site visit but could you just give us a quick heads up on what the um waikira kitty recharge project actually is what does it do it is a project um program from central plains water yep and uh what it does it takes halfway between the uh pot halfway down the pipeline and can draw water off and into a settling pond up it's like a dark field yeah and then that's released into the more into the horrata than the white territory we we find that um for cultural reasons we didn't want to go straight into white territory we wanted to filter down through uh groundwater atmospheres before it reaches the white country is a alpine fed river the want to mix those waters because we don't know what would happen if it did and at the other end like uh tiwara so what's the picture in the report what's the weak building there was that that's just the way the pump house is the water goes through into that then you see those pipes coming out in front of it yep today we can open those up well they can open them up if we want three open nothing open three but they normally what we're gonna have is open the right up and right along that front right there that falls up to about eight hundred meters uh hey it's 879 meters of water then they can turn the pipes back as needed stop the flooding oh cool okay so um a film major wants to go and have a look how would he organize that can you contact there'll be two avenues I can find out more about it about central plains water and contact them or adopt a brent painter and he'd been made to lead on one okay so we could actually get david to get the contacts from central plains if you want all right if there's no more questions for this excellent report thank you oh and I just wanted to just comment on the fact of the terrific focus that has been placed here on community and the way that we've identified that it really is coming from the bottom up in terms of taking responsibility for our uh our waterway so I also want to acknowledge the work that leads it just dying you know he's really passionate about it and really appreciate what you're doing thanks I support your comments too thank you very much liz so we're just going to put a um a note about the memo to banks peninsula community board to inform the wainui community on our where we are with the waianui wastewater project where we are or where we are not um okay so I'm happy to move the zone committee report to be received andrew will second that um just wait for that goes up to the best suppose is there any progress on the winery wastewater project the city council why do we record a project right okay any any comments you know wants to make andrew um thank you and I'll just keep this brief I'd also like to acknowledge um bonita wakefield and the contribution that she's made to the bank's peninsula zone committee in her time as chair um she certainly fostered a collaborative way of working um a very relaxed but at the same time no-nonsense approach to the work of the committee um and as we've heard from gina today the committee's making significant progress across what really is the large and very varied area of banks peninsula with a huge number of different catchments and water bodies each really with its own separate sets of issues so I'd like to thank benita for her commitment um and for everything that she's contributed to the success and the effectiveness of the committee and then the other thing I wanted to pick up on was the point that sarah drew out through questions um the the ability to submit to either the um city council ltp or the ecan ltp because they are sub-bodies of each council we really do need to find an effective way for them to get their messages across whether that is through formal submissions or whether it's through some other process there is of course an urgency here because either they need to be able to submit as part of the submission period that we're about to open or otherwise there needs to be some kind of parallel process that allows for that information to land within that same time period so if somebody can pick that up I don't think we need a resolution but if somebody can pick that up and come back to us and more to the point come back to the zone committees I think that would be very helpful thanks andrew and I think that um the letters have been received I think we should dig those out and present them to councillors as part of our ltp discussions as well but I also like to appreciate andrew's words as to come in it's really valuable and I think the zone committees are becoming stronger and stronger and gaining more and more respect and and seeing more action from your recommendations um so I'm really really proud to um to be sitting here and receiving these reports which I think are really good and they're really interesting for us all to see what work is being done on our most precious resource and our whole community and to see the level of collaboration through from community up communities where it starts and right through to collaborating with all organizations working together and it's what you guys are doing pulling all this together and driving it and it's really really incredible to see so thank you again for all the work james right kia ora um I'd like to add to the comments previously made about bonita wakefield not just for the fact that she represents wairua which is where I a puppet too but the fact that she has a phd in kopapa maori environmental health and that's a significant resource to have the table too all right I'll put the recommendation all those in favor say aye aye aye aye opposed that's carried thank you everyone okay so we move on to the next item which is the resource recovery report item eight and welcome helen beaumont to the table you're going to give us a very brief overview um I've got the foot on the pedal a wee bit but I don't want to stimulate any uh questions on the importance of this report but um it's a good report and your introduction will add even more to that so hopefully we can swim through it but ross in jos yes I've got ross potter and joshua wilson with me today because I'm anticipating there may be some questions about the organics processing plant which is a particular focus at the moment so just um a brief overview of the report and to note that we have commenced a service delivery review and that's prior to the expiry of major contracts in 2024 and 2029 and that delivery service delivery review will's a continued focus on education for the yellow recycling bins and we're pleased to see that through a combination of education and audit which has resulted in a sort of three strikes and you're out removal of bin's process as well we have had a significant improvement in the contamination levels so they continue to improve across the city and we're also seeing that where we return bins where people either pay to have that been brought back or there's a change in tenant and we have some reinforcing education that we're seeing an improvement in those previously persistent persistently contaminated bins we also have work underway at a number of closed landfills around the district now um some of this is in response to issues identified at those landfills and some of it is proactive in terms of the increasing risk due to sea level rise so there's a mix of works around around the district we are of course continuing to work on the upgrade of the organics processing plant and we are aware that we've had to cancel been able to you know maintain an update process and answer questions so those were cancelled due to the covet alert levels so what we're looking at doing uh in march is working with environment canterbury to have a venue possibly at environment canterbury that we can also run the meeting through zoom or microsoft teams if if the alert levels go back up so we um we want to we want a backup plan if things change next time so I'm happy to take questions and as I noted I've got my team here to assist great thank you helen good report are there any questions on this one for helen nope that is very surprising I think that I'm not just um I was just interested in the um auditing process of the yellow bins are we particularly targeting any suburbs because I've had complaints from some residents that feel like their suburbs are getting targeted more than others and I just want to make sure that we've had a fair process across the entire city to do the audits yeah sure a specific for for looking at the contamination is areas that are performing uh poorly with the collection so when uh by default we automatically audit trucks as they come in those audits uh that information is allocated to a particular area so if that area is performing poorly then that's where we will target the the order team um having said that there is quite a spread across christchurch where we have have done the audits and part of that process too is also to go back and check on those areas after a period of time just to see if that behavior has improved which normally it has how often if you were living in one of the targeted areas how often would your bin be checked for non-compliance uh I'd have to come back to on that it would depend on if the overall the average of that area has improved to a level we would look at looking at another area but the audit team are spread over all of christchurch but I can come back to you to see if there's a come back to you on that yeah okay I just think you know like if some I've been sure if people getting like weekly compliance checks or every every sort of you know month versus you know how often we would go back to an area but um the other thing I was really interested in was what's happening with the rfid pro tagging process of the bins how's that going because I you know I mean what well we we did hear that there was an issue with some of the performance of the tags so I just wanted to check how how we're tracking in terms of resolving that issue communication between the two waste management and council isn't it in the report it says that it's improving considerably I believe yeah and we have a meeting with waste management scheduled for monday to talk through some of some of those issues with with the contract and particularly the rfid tagging and improving on that thank you phil I'm just going to talk about bexley landfill but it's just a um we were led to believe when we were sold the concept uh from our position no we'd like to see it working better more consistently the technology itself excuse me can work but we need to be working consistently so we can use it how we anticipated using it okay so it's not quite up to what we want it's not where we'd like okay um with the close bexley landfill thing I see that we it needed some additional requirements from environment canterbury what roughly what was that uh I've got a list here not as not as much as if we'd use sheet piling I believe if we did she calling the job would be finished but part of the process and uh in terms of the consenting um we have had to look at a benthic survey which has taken three and a half months uh consent contaminated land assessment works and monitoring during construction it's two months and global nes which is national environmental standard consenting uh one and a half months and these have been done have the actual um resource consenting application which is a couple of months as well so all these have to be in place what I'm getting at our environment we're biting the bullet and fixing this our environment canterbury being uh realistic or throwing hurdles at us to make us jump through more hoops than we should um you is where I'm coming from so environment canterbury are being understandably careful because these works are in the marine zone and close to close to the sea so no they're not throwing unnecessary hoops in place but we will it does take time to work through the consenting in such a sensitive area thank you thank you and I've just got one last quick question if I may on the container return deposit scheme so does this reply to more um items than just glass correct it's uh the the current proposal draft is is looking at all beverage containers so that even goes to milk bottles for example as well as your your coke cans and um pet which is your coke uh one that we currently recycle correct so that's the scope currently that's that's going to go before the minister and then we're going we're looking at the government's looking at banning several single use plastic items so is it plastic bag so so that's uh another piece of work um I'm not too familiar with exactly what the the looking at banning there but it is to move away from uh single use there is also um looking at regulations around manufacturing only out of plastics one two and five so that gets rid of your mix plastics your three fours six sevens which are problematic to recycle and now will be difficult to ship offshore um due to the basal convention if you wouldn't mind when you get information on this if you could flick a memo out to the committee that would be really helpful because I'd actually realized it was more than glass you know I thought it was just nice okay well excellent report oh yeah one last question one other thing is um the organics processing lower than plan due to law processing costs and lower plan collection costs is that a saving to us or the contractor and why why why what I mean how could it be lower with all the complaints that we've had trying to solve the problem firstly that's a saving to us um the with with the finances with the collections and the processing we do a calculation which divides it up into the the the various um groups which is your your organics and your recycling and your your rubbish um I don't think that that calculation always is accurate um when we're dividing it back by three so sometimes we're getting unders and overs with those different waste groups so we are looking uh with finance as to how we can report that better so there hasn't uh in terms of the the actual um cost of collection and processing they have remained the same that's why the variable there is the volume okay just can't quite understand how there could be a 474 474 000 saving on organics processing like how would that money be being saved rather than just going into it just going through it's not about the complaints yeah yeah there is a wee bit in the volumes but really it is that allocation of those cost centers and actually getting that split right between those those waste streams so um maybe you could send a memo out just pushing that data out a little bit more if you wouldn't mind if that's the simple thing absolutely we're working finance now to try and get that more okay more fight yeah got one minute phil hey um the onuku closed landfill at akaroa um I see and I can imagine what it was like being an old dump and it would have very little capping on it one thing that you could I know because a couple of makes mine are looking at building some houses over there and it's big trouble to get rid of the clay the excavation could we start up an area somewhere there that we can stockpile clay for future capping because if we say right to get an abatement notice we don't want to be paying to cut the stuff in yes we'd love to to work in with because we will need capping material whether we can uh store it then we'll just need to work through we're working through a consenting process at the moment for that that camping um the capping that has eroded is on quite a steep slope there's quite a lot of vegetation there so there's a lot of preparation that will be required and it's not a big area so it would be limited as to how much we could take but when you want material anchor you can't get it when you want to get rid of it you can't find a place for it but I agree that would be great to be able to to link those two together thanks phil all right well on that note I'm happy to move who moved it oh great I thought there was a little noise over there a minute ago that something else was going very sneaky little um we've put a little extra note there requesting the bromley area pilot report and the compliance monitoring report by you can be part of this report in the future so that everyone's happy with that there's no is there any discussion on this report put the motion all those um so you basically mean like the compliance monitoring report says actual document that was asked for in december we were told it would be circulated we got it on the 14th of december and we had it in the 12th of february so we want it built into this report so we can also shouldn't it just be circulated to us when it comes into the organization rather than wait for months to get it can I can I just um just unpack that resolution a little bit so um the bromley area pilot report so it's no longer the pilot but environment canterbury are issuing a report every three months so at present so we can the three the three months bromley area report take pile it out need three months thanks that at the moment so we can provide that that is public reports publicly available on their website um thank you and and I think what we'll do is we'll take yanI's request offline and find out a way that um they that can be sent to members um yes so if you just do the bromley area one for here and we can talk about the compliance monitoring reports which which come out in response to a non-compliance and then staff work with the officers at environment canterbury to clarify the issues and then those reports are um amended or not it is following those discussions and that and that's true right across our business whether it's okay for any consent with environment canterbury but we can perhaps do that separately but this three month these three month three reports we can certainly provide okay sorry they're not three months with their monthly they've stopped doing them as far as I'm aware they've they've stopped in january doing them monthly and and they're just doing them for the that that well I mean I think we you know we're supposed to have a joint elective members talking about these things I think monthly reports are actually quite good um particularly because I mean the community are just so frustrated with having to put in thousands of complaints and giving them some feedback about what's been happening is really useful all right helen can we can we talk about that with each other if we perhaps mean that again the bromley area yep reports on odor and dust so take out the three monthly and then whatever frequency they um produce them yeah and there are the ones on odor and dust yeah and then can you please join projects so we can work with the can to determine how often those reports come out and yeah that would work better let us know thank you very much all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye right that's carried and I invite councillor tuna to close the meeting with the karakia please yoda you
I suppose that's carried thank you everyone okay so we move on to the next item which is the resource recovery report item eight and welcome helen beaumont to the table you're going to give us a very brief overview um they've got the foot on the pedal a wee bit but I don't want to stimulate any uh questions on the importance of this report but um it's a good report um and your introduction will add even more to that so hopefully we can swim through it but ross in jos yes I've got ross potter and joshua wilson with me today because I'm anticipating there may be some questions about the organics processing plant which is a particular focus at the moment so just um a brief overview of the report and to note that we have commenced a service delivery review and that's prior to the expiry of major contracts in 2024 and 2029 and that delivery service delivery review will uh inform the strategic procurement plan for those contracts there's a continued focus on education for that through a combination of education and audit which has resulted in a sort of three strikes and you're out removal of bin's process as well we have had a significant improvement in the contamination

been able to um you know maintain uh due to the covet alert levels so what we're looking at doing uh in march is working with environment canterbury to have a venue possibly at environment canterbury

believe yeah and we have a meeting with waste management scheduled for monday to talk through some of some of those issues with with the contract and particularly the rfid tagging and improving on that thank you phil I'm just going to talk about bexley landfill but it's just a question is that tagging thing working as well as what um we were led to position though we'd like to see it working better more consistently the technology itself excuse me can work but we need to be working consistently so we can use it how we anticipated using it okay so it's not quite up to what we want it's not where we'd like okay um with the close bexley landfill thing I see that we it needed some additional requirements from environment canterbury what roughly what was that uh I've got a list here not as

but we will it does take time to work through the consenting in such a sensitive area thank you thank you and I've just got one last quick question if I may on the container return deposit scheme um so does this reply to more um items than just glass correct it's uh the the current proposal draft is is looking at all beverage containers so that even goes to uh milk bottles for example as well as your your coke cans and um pet which is your coke uh one a quarter liter that that type so all the stuff that we currently recycle's going to go before the minister and then we're going we're looking

memo out to the committee that would be really helpful because this I actually didn't realize it was more than glass you know I thought it was just nice okay well excellent report oh yani one last question that's one other thing is um the organics processing and composting costs year to date which are 406 000 lower collection costs is that a saving to us or the contractor and why why why what I mean how could it be lower with all the complaints that we've had trying to solve the problem firstly that's a saving to us um the uh with with the finances um with the collections and the processing uh we we do a calculation which divides it up into the the the various um groups which is your your organics and your recycling and your your rubbish um I don't think that that calculation always is

um there hasn't uh in terms of the the actual um cost of collection and processing they have remained the same it's all the variable there is the volume okay just can't quite understand how there could be a 474 474 000 saving on organics processing when we've had adaptive management being saved rather than going into adjusting it's going through it's not about the complaints yeah yeah there is a wee bit in the volumes but really it is that allocation of those cost centres and actually getting that split right between those those waste streams so um maybe you could send a memo out just fleshing that data out a little bit more if you wouldn't mind if that's the simple thing absolutely we're working finance now to try and get that more okay more fight yeah think we'll find thanks got one minute sure hey um the onuku closed landfill at aguero um I see and I can imagine what it was like being an old dump and it would have very little capping on it one thing that you could I know because a couple of mates mine are looking at building some houses over there and it's big trouble to get rid of the clay the excavation could we start up an area somewhere there that we can stockpile clay for future capping because if we say right we get an abatement notice we don't want to be paying to cut the stuff in yes we'd love to to work in with because we will need capping material yeah whether we can store it then we'll just need to work through we're working through a consenting process at the moment for that that camping um the capping that has um eroded is on quite a steep slope

bromley area pilot report and the compliance monitoring report by you can be part of this report in future so that everyone's happy with that there's no there's any discussion on this report put the motion all those oh yani do you want to speak to me I don't quite understand um two um so you basically mean like the compliance morning report says actual document that was asked for in december we were told it would be circulated we got it on the 14th of december and we had it in the 12th of february so we want it built into this report so we can also shouldn't it just be circulated to us when it comes into the organization rather than wait for months to get it can I can I just um just unpack that resolution a little bit so um the bromley area pilot report so it's no longer the pilot but environment canterbury are issuing a report every three months so at present so we can pile it out near three months thank you that may or may not continue but they are doing that at the moment so we can provide that that is public reports publicly available on their website um thank you and and I think what we'll do is we'll take yanI's request offline and find out a way that um they that can be

three months with their monthly they've stopped doing them as far as I'm aware and they're just doing them for the liaison groups every quarter and but they may change that that's well I mean I think we you know we're supposed to have a joint elected members group talking about these things I think monthly reports are actually quite good um particularly because I mean the community are just so frustrated with having to put in thousands of complaints and giving them some feedback about what's been happening is really useful all right helen can you please can we can we talk about that with either so if we perhaps mean that again the bromley area yep reports on odor and dust so take out the three monthly and then whatever frequency they um produce them yeah and they're the ones on oda and dust yeah and then can you please join projects so we can work with the can to determine how often those reports come out and yeah that would work let us know thank you very much all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right that's carried the karakia please you
Now moving on to item nine the water services bill draft submission um now this um has been the subject of a couple of briefings there's been quite a bit of work done in the background in preparing this submission um and there may well be some matters raised today that require some further changes to be made in which case delegating um sign off probably will be the way to go in that case so um diane did you want to make some introductory remarks on this sure just I'll try to be brief um as you know the water services bill is the second in a series of pieces of legislation as part of the government's three water reform program the first one was enacting tomato arrow by water services regulator act um in the middle of last year which established tau mao to arawah as the water services regulator but a second bill was needed which is this one the water services bill which lays out the rules and responsibilities of tamata around as well as roles and responsibilities of drinking water suppliers and on drinking water there are some provisions for wastewater and storm water but mostly surround drinking water there are some differences uh between what the bill has in it and what the health act which um deals with drinking water has in it um while the both the health act and the bill talk about drinking water suppliers having to do drinking water safety plans there's a new provision in the bill that drinking water suppliers who have reticulated supplies have to provide for residual disinfection in their drinking water safety plans unless an exemption has been granted by tomoto arawai it's not clear from the way the bill is written whether those exemptions could be sought and granted for drinking water supplies like ours that don't already have residual disinfection so one of the big differences between the current situation under the health act and what the bill provides for is that um the scope of the drinking water suppliers who are subject to um to the legislation under the current situation under the health act drinking water suppliers that serve 25 people or more 60 the health act if you've got less than that then you don't the bill the water services bill changes that and basically would apply to any drinking water supplier other than a residential self-supplier so in other words if you've got your own rain water tank or your own bore and you don't supply anybody else that's a soft supplier but any any other type of drinking water supply would be subject to the billed way that's currently written the bill also makes some amendments to the local government act um which includes provisions that would that could require territorial authorities to take over private supplies that are or could be at risk of failing to meet drinking water requirements um the draft submission itself the way it's currently structured is sort of in two parts the first part focuses on key areas of concern right now that's two areas one is the requirement for residual disinfection of articulated drinking water supplies and the second is source water protection and treatment the draft submission with regard to residual disinfection points out that safe without residual treatment and the submission also raises concerns about the uncertainty over how exemptions to residual treatment will be granted and the process of seeking redress if a drinking water supplier wishes to challenge the decision of the regulator because right now the regulator the way the bill is written the regulator can grant or not an exemption to residual disinfection as it on grounds that it pleases so it's there's they're not specified in regard to source water protection the requirement for physical treatment of source water the draft submission points out that source water risk management plans and drinking water safety plans can provide a multi-barrier approach and this mission also talks about the fact that combined confined aquifers naturally provide for removal of particles and pathogens and the submission is also seeking in terms of source water protection to do more to protect sources of drinking water as there's gaps that aren't really addressed in the bill about that and instruments such as the national policy statement for fresh water management really don't deal very well with groundwater and part a number of recommendations on more technical matters one of them has to do with the again the amendment to the local government act having to do with territorial authorities having to take over failing private drinking water suppliers and I think I'll stop there and open it up for questions thank you so are there any questions on this leanne I'm happy to move it yep just a question that's come to my mind do you think there should be differentiation in between um surface water suppliers and groundwater supplies um I think it would my answer would be it depends oh they said it depends on it depends on the source yeah there I think there's some pretty obvious differences that in general um it would be hard to find a service water supply that doesn't have um a fairly high probability of being subject to contamination of one sword or another just because it's open to the the environment whereas ground water is naturally protected because it isn't yes but I mean there's certainly some and then there shallow ground water yes yes okay thank you any further questions on this all right so leanne you've indicated you're happy to move this sarah you've indicated you're happy to second so moved by the mayor seconded by the temple delegate the the cheer and mir the authority to sign the final submission yep so that allows for any um changes to be made just to finalize this and if you could pop me in as the person to make this submission I mean I don't mind if if anyone else wants to um do that as well so number four just to be represented by the mayor and supported by appropriate staff yep excellence all right so that's been moved and seconded is there any debate all right so I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you all right now um we might at this point take our morning tea break um a little bit early it's um 10 to 11 if we just take a 10 minute
As you know I've got a really hard finish time as I have a commitment or a number of us do have commitments um away from here at uh 12 o'clock so I want to finish on the on the on the well I want to finish before 12 o'clock um to a june for the for the lunch um and I'm just wondering whether um given that there will be a number of questions in relation to this whether we uh adjourn the meeting now and recommence at one o'clock um which would you could all your px items do no no there's just there's just one item in px so we could do the px item and then adjourn for lunch and then come back at one o'clock and deal with the remaining item on the on the agenda all right well I'll move the um the resolution to exclude the public for the reason set out on pages 82 and 83 of the agenda noting that the item on the agenda um sorry I haven't got the expecting it there it is noting that the item on the agenda relate to minutes and to audit and risk management committee remuneration and as soon as the audit and risk committee management committee independent members and chair have been advised of the council decisions this report will be released so it is simply to protect the reputations of under independent members with respect to their fees until the decision has been made and notified to them so I just wanted to clarify that period uh seconded by sam mcdonald I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried and are no recorded by
Um so linda you're presenting on this one and len welcome back to the table as well there was a matter came up earlier regarding the fact that we've got the increase in this report um there's obviously other information sitting in a public excluded attachment um would you be able to make some comment on the public excluded nature of what's in that you know the reason why the information is sitting where it is yes um it seems to me from what I've been able to ascertain that that information should have in fact gone into the public part of the report it was only the comparative um information around other local authorities that was to remain in px so I suggest a way around that is that we just add a recommendation that the council agrees that the px attachment remuneration armc independent chair and members be removed from px and attached to the public report yeah so that then just to clarify brings the remuneration information as it relates to this council into the public report but the comparative information remains bring into the public arena it's provided to us on a confidential basis that's fine all right thank you for that so if we can just add that resolution all right um so are there any um remarks from staff on this report we can take it as read and the information in its um reasonably easy to understand I think it's fair to say is there anything that you wanted to draw to our attention before we move to questions okay we'd like to take it to read we'll answer any questions all right thank you um so other questions all right no questions so sam you're happy to move is there a seconder phil you're happy to second is there any debate yummy um probably doesn't come as a surprise to most people in this room but I certainly will not be supporting the increase at the moment I believe with the financial situation we're in especially with um covert 19 and the impact that that's had on our budgets um that we're not in a position there would be um suitable people that would do it for the current fees and I am not supportive of increasing the fees at this stage sam you're thinking I do understand what yanI's saying but uh having been someone that went through the process of trying to appoint people to this committee it's very clear that if you pay peanuts you will get monkeys um this hasn't been reviewed since 2013. it's a very small amount of money in the scale of things and like you said um you know yeah in terms of the financial implications that's why we need really good competent independent people we get incredible value for money from the people we have there now and so I do hope that people um you know respect this and and do support it the best thing about this is that we've agreed a process going forward in terms of how we'll review it so we won't get caught out like this again um but you know I just need to emphasize you know in the scale of it for money they're in the commercial sector they paid a lot more than this and we get tremendous value from them I would echo that comment the independent members and the independent chair in fact bring significant robustness and value and vigor to the audit and risk management committee it's an extremely important committee of council a lot of the work that goes through that committee it needs to be done well it's one area where they need to be very clear focus and certainly those independent members bring that clarity of focus and that rigor to the committee a different set of eyes or different sets of ice and outside of our organization particularly around that table in my view bring huge value just reiterating the comment that sam has made regarding the recruitment process um we didn't have a wide range of choice when we went through that process um I believe that we were very fortunate to have good people that were able to be appointed and I'm very comfortable with the appointments that we made but to to suggest that to choose from certainly wasn't our experience at the time that we made that last set of appointments leanne when I became the mayor that this wasn't a position held by an independent person uh we've been really well served by two extraordinary people who've stepped up to taken up that independent chairs role it previously was chaired by a council in fact the previous chair of the ordinary committee was in the room before helen broughton and I think it's really important that we do have um independence and that's what these people bring to the table this is always a risk when you don't keep the um when you don't keep the remuneration up to date and when you let it sit for eight years then it looks like a bigger jump than it actually is so over the period of time I think if we'd move things gradually which is the go forward position then it wouldn't look like the the jump that it is I know that times are difficult for people but we do need books and the value that they add to this organisation benefits all the residents of christchurch so I'm very happy to support the resolution thank you any further contribution to debate james yeah look while I i do have some sympathy for what once again for what yani has put but I more fully support the statements made since by the other three speakers but I also want to underline that um the fact that we're paying a very low and it is a quite a low fee uh doesn't mean I'm pleased that the deputy mayor said that we did get they were happy or we were happy with what we got in terms of an appointment because someone mentioned you pay peanuts you get monkeys we don't have monkeys thank you so this has been moved and seconded um I will put the motion all those in favor say aye against so we'll just note that um so yani and mike as well yep so we'll just note that and that's carried thank you all right so now we move to the resolution
Have a wonderful day thank you and the next item on the agenda has me uh moving that the council leave the report to lie on the table until the meeting of the 11th of march to enable staff to provide additional information do I have a seconder for that andrew I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that is carried and now we move on to the chairperson's report representation on coastal hazards working group and if I could invite mike davidson to speak to that as the chair of the group
You all right now we move to item 14 the closeout report on stapleton's road randall street and peshwa street renewal so let's take any commentary on this first long as you take the report as read but if there's anything the staff particularly want to highlight um and then we'll take any questions thank you mr chair um I would like to take a moment at your discretion to just put a bit of context behind this because it has been a couple of couple of questions so yeah stapleton's um gosh I can't even get this straight stapleton's randall and petrie street are in the richmond area the um the council many of the council many many of you will remember the dudley creek bypass went through this suburb post earthquake and um it was part it was a big part of the land drainage program at the time and at the time also there was skirt works going on across the city so there were two streets in this report petri street and sort of two thirds of randall street creek bypass going down those streets so and then and the duddy creek bypass was reported to this committee at on the 5th of december 2018. so that closeout report has been to this committee in the past through the 2018-28 long-term plan there was a lot of feedback from the richmond community they'd had a lot of works in the area where they'd had a lot of construction trucks and they were you know and these streets were in pretty poor condition that was the feedback we were getting staff worked with the community and community groups to understand their understand their concerns and as a result of that we developed a program of works that was put into the ltp and has since been progressed these are those these are the first of these straights that you're seeing today staff um the transport team also took over the responsibility of the final reinstatement for those bits of petrie and randall that the dudley creek bypass had um wiped out pretty much because they pretty much had gone down the whole street they'd taken the coal bit down there um and I think post this report at post that time we have worked together better as teams across council to make sure we are coordinating our works where we can it doesn't always happen with asset renewals but when we've got big assets reinstatements like the dudley creek bypass we are trying a lot better to have a better outcome for the community post that works other than that if we jump forward to doing these streets kirsten here was the project manager and on the whole the works went really well the community's been very positive about what we're doing we've still got more works going on in that suburb so there are more streets to report on in the future great thank you and thank you for that particular update as well um that helps to put this report in context um I mean it may be that in future with these reports it would be good to have that contextual information as part of the report but it's great that you've been able to provide see this report in that broader context of the the particular situation at the time chair I'm very supportive of that approach as well yeah so that it means we don't have to retrofit in in the committee yep great thank you very much so are there any questions on this report mike I don't know I can do this as a question but um look I think everyone agrees especially in the community that you know the outcome after everything with someone was really good but I guess from an elected member's point of view um it didn't seem to be as smooth sailing as this report and it's great that you know we've obviously looked at you know we've combined the work that were happening to make sure we got everything done um but from my recollection it was it wasn't that straight straight forward to getting that little bit of randall added to this whole project um the outcome was good but I guess when I look at the lessons there was a workshop and it included a there I guess would be um governance perspective so potentially the ward councillors say hey look these are some of the issues that we found from our point of view to make sure I guess that would could be developed moving moving forward um sorry I wasn't really a question but can I can I can I respond yes and we are starting to do that more and more um so we are looking to do the same thing with uh with your own board about the downstream effects works that have been done from the cnc so that is that is something that we are looking to try and do more of and report back through the boards as well and get that feedback I think to be fair to the roading team and the transport team the issues that were being had and the concerns that were being had that resulted in the community meeting were about the dudley creek bypass so and I get like I understand I'm going to go as a transport team yeah I'm just saying when we look at the includes the the whole length of randall street and I just know when we were when we were going through that time it was it wasn't that straightforward we felt from our point of view to actually give ensure that the whole of randall street was done at the time like the outcome was great um so yeah got to the outcome yeah yeah but it was because only two thirds of the street was being was funded as far as that yeah no I understand that and I guess yeah like I said moving forward lessons learned we just need to have elected members and this was back in 2017-18 yeah when we were having these conversations so could it be worth putting a noting provision in there noting that in future closeout reports will invite comment from local councils it's not so much the closeout report it's the project itself um you know this is the closeout report doing exactly what we want it to do which is you know looking back on the project here we've got a report that on the face report it would appear that you know this project was delivered well and the community were happy with the outcome all of that is true but clearly there were some conversations that happened along the way and some frustrations along the way that are not called out in this report as as perhaps um have been described by the local councillor I think that tells us something first of all about the the purpose of these reports it's good that this report generates the discussion we're having now um secondly and picking up on the point that I made earlier it's important that we put any contextual information into these reports in future so that we get a a fair picture of how this project was delivered but in the context of you know other the the yeah how the the the um project which is the subject of the report was delivered noting anything that happened along the way and noting any contextual information within which that project rightly sets up so to be clear from the perspective of the whole organization both members and officers what we did well what didn't go as well on what we would change and making sure we make those changes and they stick and that's about being a really good learning organization I think these reports are very good but it's capturing all the elements and I think the members are raising a legitimate issue in terms of how we get that voice I know this history and I appreciate that but there is a way we can do that I'm sure yeah okay this is this is the closeout report doing exactly what it's intended to do which is saying when we come across you know issues like the one that's been described involving the elected members giving the elected members a heads up having early elected member involvement probably could help avoid that sort of situation or resolve it more easily in future that's this close-out report raising that discussion exactly the purpose of the close-out report interest sorry just to clarify saying I'm not the local councillor it's pauline I'm just right board member thank you this report is it focuses at a very detailed level on what was done but it doesn't focus on that high level strategic question around why land drainage projects weren't incorporated with roading at the start and that's probably the biggest concern I've got with land drainage as someone who's had projects in my ward where residents have asked for similar things to happen and they're not happening so you know I'd be really interested if there was any kind of lessons learned around how you can get a greater synergy around a land drainage project and then what's the um outcome in terms of the final road roading project and I think you're correct because the land drainage work had to be done first then it became a transport project to reinstate it's just that one piece of the road was not included in either of them all right can I get some comment from staff on this if that's possible that's not actually 100 correct the land drainage project was going through and the land drainage as as staff we are looking and we need to look more at how we can get benefit for the community when we put really large really large infrastructure projects right through communities like this we're working hard to try and achieve that moving forward at the time scoot was also working in this area the transport unit wasn't it didn't actually have a program of works in the richmond area so there was a hot there was a whole another level of complex complexity and noise those two streets were always being there we're following the feedback from the community meetings and the ltp we developed a program of works now these projects were on it and these projects were always prioritized on that and we've got a prioritized programme programmer works that is rolling out through the richmond area over the next 10 years got me really confused are you saying that then when a land drainage project comes through a street rips up the whole street puts a pipe down the middle of it the land drainage section is renews the street're seeing when a utility goes through a street yeah so any utility via empower anyone they are only responsible for reinstating what they need to and that's what they have impact that's what I was saying and so the other end of the street wasn't in their program no it wasn't a program that's exactly right but that's the kind of lesson that there wasn't a there wasn't a street it wasn't a streets program in there either that's right because of the skirt works that was going on so there was a whole level of complexity around this particular area yeah that we then worked with the community and I think that's the good news story land drainage and transport and three waters all work with the community and everyone knows the priority and the program moving forward so that is the good news part of this question the three waters kind of department like so I mean I went and looked at the children's brick barrel amazing job they're doing there but if you mounted right so they're going to spend all this time reinstating the middle of the road when you've got buggered footpaths on each side for a small or not small but for a cost-effective variation to the contract to do it do it once and fix the footpath at the same time as you do the road it seems like a really sensible thing to do so I mean that's the sort of lesson learnt that I was kind of hoping that we would get from this is where there's opportunities to do synergy here's the process we use to consider it so that is a separate matter than you were previously discussing in the last 10 minutes because that also needs to relate to the fact that might be an additional project that you do not have on budget and you've just gone through all of the capital programme in terms of proposing might what might go forward in terms of the ltp your point in principle that captures I think is well made and it's ensuring that we both maximize what or whatever it might be and if there is opportunity to do additional in an effective and efficient way and you have the resources to do that then we should take those but do not assume that means every time we dig somewhere else we're therefore going to take on additional work that are not on budget but it's the process to consider whether we do it or not and at what level and that was I mean without the community raising up on this one I don't think it would have happened yeah um and some communities won't raise up but it might be sensible to do it so if there's a process around it then we can we can through the chair yeah it does happen and it does happen all the time we are we sit on the same floor as our colleagues in three waters and they're quite nice people I quite like talking to them so like we do we do all the time um we did hereford street recently we've replaced the water main we did record it all the time but as dawn's just pointed out it depends on the age of the asset the condition of the asset and that and the budgets that we've got available yeah I think all of that's well understood and and thank you for that all right now I'm keen to move this on because we're a quarter to one already and I'll come to you for a further question uh it's not a question it's just actually to reinforce and and to endorse what lynette said you know we just had a briefing last night at our community board where we had a team of all those people that were working together to make sure ireland middleton road ricketton road we're working you know together so I think you know it is happening all right thank you any further questions on this report all right so we are removing receipt of the report um I'm happy to move that do I have a second or jimmy chen is there any debate all those in favor say aye against the audit and risk management committee remuneration
Um alastair welcome back to the table thank you any commentary on this um I'll just there's a couple of updates that's with uh just a couple of things worth noting and the hornby elective member update we just wanna early works has been uh confirmed and will be awarded and will be underway in march uh the blessing is uh this friday tomorrow so that's a couple of really good steps forward um design is moving at a pace so we're looking to prepare to go to market shortly on hornby as well um metro sports um we've probably talked enough about metro sports but there has been some substantial um activity on site and for those that yeah that blind you you certainly certainly can see the uh the structure going up at the moment around the city from every window in this building anyway so um talk to old municipal chambers we continue to um carry out cyclical the agreement that we've got with the uh city of christchurch trust and box 112 is uh is is is complete now city of christchurch trust to um I now sit on their pcg so their project control group um and they're working towards uh through develop design into detail design and they've got quite a lot of that work completed today so they're looking to apply for consent very shortly so and they're also commencing the um wrap of the building within the next month as well which is another cost that that they're undertaking um there's a question around uh maintenance coming to an end which will come to an end in this financial year on that particular project because of the handover and the responsibilities sitting with the trust so and they'll take that further um and the timeline currently for construction is is still late 2022 completion on the current program of work um just on the election member for the member update for the square something to note is the police kiosk demolition which is due to be elected march and will commence in march that's the only thing I really want to mention on the square in particular at a pace and there are papers coming through in march for uh council's approval and the fmp committee approval so nothing more to say really um on on the reports there oh thank you probably linwood sorry um yeah linwood's moving along at a pace and I'm actually missing the psg at the minute okay great thank you so moving to questions pauline thank you just on the square um I see that due to the distinction being a quarantine facility now the it's delayed that work around that southeast but you also see there's a slight amendment of the design um of the landscape plan because they require some carry access to it yeah so look it's a we're in a concept mode at the moment anyway so we're ongoing discussions with the the ownership of um the distinction hotel um we are continuing to complete those designs in readiness for the miq facility coming out of its period of uh yeah it has agreed on mb but it's only minor amendments that's all it's not huge ongoing design of that right it's nothing big no okay thank you any further questions on this report aaron yeah I just had a quick one but you've mostly answered it on the old municipal chambers so by next month's meeting will we see a new um graph down the bottom of the timeline of what will be happening in the completion would you have that locked in by then we do have uh obviously through the agreement process we've gone through they've given us an indicative program already and it's extremely detailed to be quite honest um I think it's it's more around the timing of their start so um their consents are now they're now getting nearer nearer to putting their designs into info consents once that's established then we can proceed to understand the actual impacts that will have on the program delivery yeah so at the minute the indicative is as ever is december 2022 so I would expect that to slip into 23 early 23 there's no doubt um but they're proactively trying them at the moment on access requirements because they're going in and out of the building to review certain areas to inform their structural engineering and also their ultimately their architectural design as well right okay so that would we should get an update at the next in two months time we certainly should have an update yeah oh okay that's quite good because you don't want to misread that because you changed one letter and it's cynical maintenance thank you yanny just in regards to the score and surrounds um the final bullet point development of strand lane um it says it will um be finalized for construction to start after the post office strengthening it looks really exciting what's proposed for that site although I did note I think in the media that there was a request for a license to occupy or release area from council and I was just wondering if we're likely to get a sort of report around what's proposed what um the licensing or leasing will be and I guess also what the work in cathedral could probably I can I can respond to the work that's required and with the lease I'll have to go away and ask and get their relevant information unless right but get relevant information but I can certainly uh talk to the work around because armatures williams are carrying out the work for the chamberlain building the old post office yeah and we're working with um alexis williams at the moment around procuring their services to complete that work so that we don't have the same instance that we had with the spark building which was two separate contractors trying to work together to complete their work in timing with their work it's better if we can do it under a set said understanding of what are their what their profit margin is going to be that they'll want so we're doing this under agreed set terms really so I mean I'm really happy to hear that I think it just makes so much sense um so thank you just all I was what I was trying to understand though in terms a plan that we've already approved or is there a like a landscape plan this is a reinstatement of the pre-existing in that area it's not going to be a complete redraft of the um of the type of and the type of behaviors that are going down there it's going to be like for like but right yeah with with strengthening work obviously is that future-proofed for yeah it's for it's the now work really that we're doing so I can bring back the I can provide the documents that we've got in the designs we've got just as a maybe as in an email back to yourself yeah that that's awesome so you've got that information yeah I think the key thing is in the consumer's race too with the distinction that we're not we'll start we're not spending money on something that we're going to dig up a year later because we've got some new fancy plan no way this is the permanent work for the medium term yeah okay that happy to move do I have a seconder sam any debate all those in favor say I against that's carried thank you and then moving straight on to item 13. can't_''_447.68
Now moving to item 11 and the corporate finance report again for the period ending 31st december yes bruce this is yours as well uh I guess key points on the executive summary uh standard and poor's reconfirmed our credit rating double a minus with a stable outlook uh all treasury risk positions within policy limits there's been a decrease in non-rates debt and also a decrease in rate debt and terms of 3.3.2 in terms of the the installment for deferments from last year currently as it last week there's about 127 000 outstanding so that's largely been paid uh those rate payers uh currently have a balance outstanding of about half a million dollars so largely that issue's been dealt with other than that 4.4.2 we've pre-funded 132 million of debt that's due for repayment in may so we've borrowed that early and invested it until may making us making a slight margin on it so it's um that's good and it reduces our risk of being able to pay that debt um that's about all there right thank you and I would also and you've highlighted it already draw attention to um paragraph 3.1.1 um we obviously were um very pleased that standard poor has reaffirmed our rating at a minus um in the current environment that was particularly good news so we're very happy about that um and just one question on the comment you made around the rate status is that tracking pretty much as we would expect um given the um covert 19 payment extension is that how we would have expected that to track uh yes simple answer is yes it is um and it's quite quite positive the um the the rate state is uh not significantly more than it than it ever has been really yeah all right thank you any further questions on this report all right again I'm happy to move receipt of the report samuel second any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried now we move to item 12 the capital delivery
And torI's away today so um tyrone fields is presenting on her behalf so tori is away today so I'm subbing in because that's what deputies are for uh one team one dream so um first up today we've got um magnificent thing sale gp catamaran racing so look I think it's worth just acknowledging the support that council have shown for infrastructure um within littleton just as a background to that like in terms of the cruise ship terminal in terms of naval point in terms of just things like really good toilets because all of those things the investment that we make in littleton harbor whakakaraopa littleton harbour really adds up to good outcomes for the city and I think you know even the you know you've got to spend money to make money sometimes and you know even the most hardened neoliberal ideologue and hopefully there aren't too many of those left but um even they would agree that you know this is a really good investment um a really good opportunity for um the city um to to you fantastic and um littleton harbour like you don't need to spend half a billion dollars to have a world-class stadium you can actually have one for free you know you've just got the magnificent harbour all around where you can watch the sailing it's going to be a marvelous event so I just ask you know you to continue supporting the infrastructure that that um that we have or you know that that um we've got lined up in banks peninsula and it's hopefully going to be an incredible event so please support naval point and the development there um you know we want to keep attracting world-class events to to christchurch and we've got a wonderful asset um and banks peninsula that we can do that with little river thanks penn so so this is part of the little river big ideas community plan um it's got here the traffic management and beautification of the village center so that's now complete stage one so with the installation of the 3d speed humps there so I know it's hard to believe it like it's just a it's called an optical illusion and um so that's been been painted in there now um so the village planning project for stage two is now underway that involves uh um the council on land behind the cafe in the railway station so include a farmers market hopefully a community garden recreational green space pony ride venture and a petting zoo so like the the community in little river are just just amazing it's very small in size but very big in heart and and determination and what they put their mind to they they they do a lot of stuff so we always love love to have little river big ideas come and see us at the board and you know as you can see there you know it's a really really good outcomes and and long may continue diamond harbor so this is so what we've basically done is we've recently approved the provision of 16 informal it's important that it's informal park and ride spaces um it's start-up point which is um where the where the wharf is and and so the ferry terminal there as well um look it's a this is a real hard thing to get right like it's you know we're lucky to have a really good traffic engineer on the for the peninsula andrew hensley who who really helps us work through the issues that we have this is a this is a damned if you do damned if you don't situation so so we've come up with a decision we we hope it's right for the community we'll we'll see we'll see how that pans out but um we just want to make um the infrastructure as good as possible as part of the overall city transport network and it's just we're just always listening always open to ideas to how we can improve it this is this is an example of of that happening and and and hopefully the outcomes of that will work out and last but not least so fire risk management with apparently it's a hot topic on the on um the I'm a dad so it's okay the um so the board's really concerned I think about the risk of fire on the peninsula it's um obviously there's a lot of rural land there it's it's a 70 of the city's total area but a lot of it is rural a lot of it is um open to risk of of fire and we all know what what can happen there and we've seen over over the summer some luckily fortunately thanks to the really wonderful fire brigades that we have out on the peninsula in the city those fought those fires um mitigated and put out in the nick of time they could have been much much worse um so look we're really concerned about that there isn't a community group in in banks peninsula that isn't concerned about that and we just ask that this council is really active in being able to figure out ways in which we can support and facilitate uh the risk of fire in in the in the port hills as a board is we're following up with orion orion regarding uh power lines and proximity of that to trees it's a bit of a concern and how that's being monitored and maintained with inviting finns and a fire an emergency in new zealand to talk to the board around high-level approach to fire risk management and so we just want to keep up that engagement it's just an ongoing conversation it's not it's not something that can be solved overnight it's about just open dialogue with lots of different groups and just working together and so council staff are working as hard as they can on having a fire break between reserves and residences there's a lot of stakeholders and a lot of players in that so so we really need um just support and helping council staff to carry out the things that they need to do just to protect our residents and to protect the environment and and the and the you know the natural splendor of the port hills and the peninsula so that's me happy to've got a part a on the on the agenda for today yes we do have a party madam yes so but um there are a couple of issues that that um I and a couple of others have with the with some of the elements of the report so it's my intention to to move that it lie on the table and we'll get the elements of the issues that we want to have uh brought to the table um available for the next meeting so just wanted to kind of raise it in the context of your okay I appreciate that it was a part a off your report yeah I think you get a lot of issues like that on the peninsula and they all need to be treated in their own sort of unique way so you know we're just happy for that there is no hurry it's a it's a long-standing issue and um it's an inheritance from a previous previous time yeah yeah so we're very familiar with those yes you are yeah thank you it comes a larger city yeah always so we're not unique in that so andrew did you have any questions or you're happy to move it you have a question yep just the melanoma my um community board as well as I'm sure heathcote and halls will share your community's concerns with regards to fire and you're right that our teams are doing amazing things but you can only do so much but it is a real concern we just have to keep talking about it tim absolutely and and you know so thank you for maybe we could get the community boards together just uh yeah I think that a combined community board um briefing with fenza and our our teams would be actually very positive yeah yeah that's a it's a good idea yeah we do we do and let's work together thank you I appreciate that that that's a good outcome thank you sarah did you have a question you can second it all right it's been moved and seconded any discussion I'll put the motion all those carried thank you very much thank you have a wonderful day thank you and the next item on the agenda has me moving that the council leave the report
Agenda we are now at item 10 the financial performance report for the six months ended 31st december um bruce welcome to the table um are there any introductory remarks on this report item 10. thank you mr chia no the um financial report for the first six months is very positive um operating we have a net 10.2 million dollar underspend at the end of december it's forecast to be slightly lower at 6.2 million at the end of the year after carry forwards it was forecast at 1.5 last time we reported to you in september so it has improved progressively over the last three months and in fact end of january it was 8.4 and we believe it'll be even even more positive at the end of february so that's all good signs the net underspin is made up of additional revenue a lot of that is turnover revenue which also has some additional costs associated with it reckon sport consenting interest costs and billwood landfill etc in terms of expenditure 13 million 13.7 million under budget at the end of december it's at the end of june we've included a late table at 5.6 which gives a wee bit more detail on those underspins and where they're projected to be at year end and the reasons um in terms of capital given the earlier report which was more up to date that you had a wee bit earlier I just proposed to leave that information as it is happy to answer any questions all right thank you very much other questions on this report yanny just one question on page 104 which is around the transport it's just the forecast under speed from the reduced road landscape maintenance we've just had the exceptions report we've seen you know the high levels of satisfaction and the high number of complaints coming in around um rating maintenance so I just really interested in the comment there that says the forecast under spenders from reduced landscape road landscape maintenance as this was cut back only to the most necessary maintenance I guess the concern is to really understand what's behind that given that you know I am getting on being done so if we've got money available is there an issue around allocating that resource or is that more of a policy decision that's been made I would have to defer that question to someone from transport I'm happy just to get him in my back yeah let's just get a memo back I guess the key takeaway we we've just heard that we've got an issue with streets and transport in terms of maintenance and here we've got an underspin so how can we how can we use that to remediate we'll bring you a mama back counsellor thank you any further questions tim yeah I follow on from yanis I'm getting a lot of calls with regards to the maintenance and the lack of maintenance to road reserves so just where that falls whether it's parks or roading but around the hills broad oaks would be an example where the locals are really concerned about the fire risk so it'd be really good to um hear back where that because if it is savings through reduced community about that and there is proven fire risk then that would be an interesting discussion to have so I'd be interested in that memo yep thank you anything else on this all right thank you I'm happy to move receipt of the report um james is happy to second any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried now moving to item 11 and the corporate financial
We might well we will move to item 20 because we've dave we've already done the resolution to include the supplementary assembly yeah yeah perfect okay um well thanks everyone so obviously as leanne and andrew noted this morning they're conflicted on this one so I won't be participating except leanne's going to sit at the end of the table with humphrey and amy if there are questions for the foundation so that's a decision yep land's made um so what we could do is then yeah do you guys so lynn and linda do want to talk through your report what we might then do is I mean if humphrey and amy and liam want to come and add something to it and then we can just go through questions so what I guess the way we'll play it out is if the factual questions on the report um you know we'll talk through the offices or you know the staff through that but if it's more around some of the issues that you guys can't answer then can answer those so do you want to walk us through the report yes thank you chair the morning everybody um the report we've provided um is um came from the about the review that was requested as part of our funding agreement um the foundation's been in existence for three years deloitte was commissioned to undertake the work the we've supplemented the work that's done by deloitte to do a bit more additional benchmarking and the report has been we've tabled we believe a balanced report which provides there are questions and probably as you say the foundation would may be best to answer those directly but it will answer any questions on the quality of the information that's in the report so we'll just leave it up to the committee sure so do we want to do you want to go through I wonder if it's useful before you are we go to questions amy and humphrey do you and leanne if you want to do you want to just maybe give us a quick update and then we just it's going to be it's going to be easier yeah we'll see we get the whole picture before we delve into questions good morning everyone thank you chair um I'll just make a couple of observations and then very happy to take any questions from counselors so just the christchurch foundation first of all is owned by the people of canterbury the christchurch foundation chairman is owned by the people of canterbury they are who is chairman I look to to to do my reporting the christchurch city council has generously decided in its wisdom to support philanthropy and the most practical way you guys have elected to do that is by giving an annual grant to the christchurch foundation that annual grant started at six hundred thousand per annum it's now running at five hundred and forty thousand per annum and it is my wish as the chair of the foundation to reduce that further uh by the end of the six-year period we have given you extensive reporting and to your council staff extensive reporting we are in an order we are audited to and supported the review that the council wished to make and was built into the document on day one we in fact built it in for you that it could that you had the opportunity to review the operations of the foundation I just wish to share with you that deloitte and wellington I i didn't meet the people um but we came in by voice they had a brief from the council and that's your brief it's not ours that that brief is it says what it says uh in my view it was uh uh it wasn't_''_260.479 a very strange brief um but that's your that's your issue not mine um and I did ask the deloitte people in wellington uh what experience they have in reviewing foundations because we're a new phenomenon in new zealand it's only over the last 15 years or so that or 20 years that foundations have got going deloitte's answer to me and I think councillors should know this is that they had not reviewed a foundation before so I thought okay personally answered every query that was raised under your brief not mine to assist deloitte my chief executive did the same and we gave them full access to our auditors and our accountants full access the only access we will not give them is confidential information that pertains to our commercial clients uh who support the foundation and philanthropy in our city it's none of deloitte's business there's no conclusion they could draw from it except to say haven't you done well um so that's that's the background and we're very happy to to answer questions and we do think I suppose as a fundamental thing chair we do think that the comparative exercise is flawed and amy will detail you in a very simple manner why that is flawed and maybe that would be quite a good first question to us because the media seemed to be wanting to compare cents per uh employee or some crazy ratio which is completely irrelevant and I have had other chairs of and and trustees of foundations around new zealand saying don't these people what you have with us is a completely different foundation that operates in auckland and in dunedin and interestingly enough uh one thing we we take take increasing pride in is that foundations around the world are reaching out to look at our model and so uh disaster uh uh um assistance requirements which we provided under your request backed up by the prime minister for the mosque massacres so we're a very efficient tool for the people of canterbury to own and support and my judgment is that that support is rolling in increasingly month on month not necessarily in dollars but an understanding of what we stand for and what we are doing and how we are networking connecting and finally we are donor centric we love our donors and we help them we are not so interested in the causes because that looks after itself thank you um just to give you a cost comparison so and I understand the intent and the need to want to compare us to understand value for money of your investment it's a good one but to remove the 15 and to keep the costs we incurred in that meant that the figures were a little skewed and I'd just like to talk you through that remembering that we were established on the back of the canterbury earthquakes to respond to a need here in otautahi that wasn't filled when the earthquakes happened which was to help those people that love our city and it surrounds to give to our recovery and a part of our establishment that this organisation has set up was that we were to respond in times of crisis and on the day of the shootings I received a call from leanne at 10 o'clock at night asking us to set that up we set up an entire gifting platform overnight at no expense additional expense to the council and then began what is the most complex fund gathering and distribution process that has ever been run in new zealand and I've had that said to me from my peers across new zealand who have rung in support over the last two days so if we do add back in the of last financial year we had raised 12.6 million dollars for this city and its people our total opex costs in that time were 1.8 million and that brings down our opex cost per dollar to 13 cents in the dollar which is significantly more efficient than what was in the report and that would be the one thing I'd really like to ensure that you understand that swallowed us whole for a year and a half when you talk to raph and I we will both tell you that's the hardest thing we have ever done professionally it was thousands of hours and the other unintention consequence of this process is I've received phone calls over the last two days from members of that community that now think you don't care because you removed it out of that calculation and that is devastating but moving on since the end of that last financial year we've raised an additional 2.94 million to date for our city which brings us to a grand total of 15.9 million dollars over that period of time I also want continue at the existing funding reduced funding levels that we requested a reduction in funding from you of 5.40 your total investment in us until the end of the six-year period and our establishment will be 3.4 million under contract and funds that we've already distributed back to you is 2.5 million meaning that your annual investment to establish the christchurch foundation a legacy for the city that will last for generations is a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and I've got two more years to maybe generate some more revenue for you so that's the situation that we're in and I thank you for the opportunity to talk you through that great thank you amy for that um leanne are you going to add anything or no I've confirm what um amy said uh from the outset christchurch didn't have a foundation at the time of the earthquakes the prime minister had to step in and set up a prime minister's fund the mayor of the day set up a mayor's fund in fact when I became the mayor in the kitty as it were from the and then in the cost-sharing agreement there was provision for philanthropic contributions there were none to be obtained the issue was brought to the council and it was left to us to find a way forward and that's where the concept of the the community foundation a place based giving organization which has been established in new zealand since about 2003 so what humphrey has said is right this is a relatively new model of place-based giving we did look at the rata foundation as an existing organisation but they can't fundraise they can't gather new money they can't accept bequests they simply distribute that which has been already provided to them so we did look at other options this has been an exceptional organisation I never imagined for one minute that I would be in a position to call on the foundation to establish a fund in the wake of a massacre in the city uh but I was able to make that phone call at 10 o'clock in the evening I thought it might have the amount of money that was coming in through the victim support platform the give a little page uh was just mounting and mounting and mounting and that was not a sustainable model as it proved to be this model proved to be within 36 hours our chief executive who'd been in the role for a relatively short period of time had won the confidence of the department of prime minister and cabinet and had the prime minister's support for the platform our people our city fund and I was enormously proud the last thing that I wanted to say was that I've sat around the foundation board table as a trustee and I do so with incredible pride and gratitude for every single trustee that sits around that table and hasn't taken one cent in fees since it was established the people have come on board because they believe in leaving a legacy for the earthquakes for the moss shootings for any challenge that comes our way and then with some of the initiatives which you're all well aware of some of the initiatives project for example the tui corridor I've just mentioned I'm just conscious of time yeah but I just wanted to say that with the with this this is the legacy for thank you city cool thank you um len and linda I wonder if you want to just join at the table so that we can then direct the questions as you said initially either to the foundation or to relevant staff okay so does anybody have any questions initially I mean I'm happy to oh okay so go jake first and then um so one I've got about three questions one that's just come out of what's been presented the costs in terms of distributing that money and I will use the word distribute that money because if there's money that would have come in any way I'm thinking particularly of refs fees what was that from your normal operations budget or was that funded elsewhere yes it was from within our operations budget but we also received a hundred thousand dollars from the government to help pay ref to do it okay right okay um and in terms of the documents you haven't handed over a few documents why not the conflict of of interest jim and I did answer that oh I'll be kind of if you can just elaborate are there confidential information for commercial customers donor agreements don't know agreement no no the conflict of interest yeah register other conflict that we don't have we manage conflicts perfectly well I spent my whole life managing conflicts yeah that's what humphrey that's fine but there was a request that was one of the concerns raised yeah so yeah we just can't understand why it wasn't provided that are you dreaming about conflicts of interest they want to see a conflict of this register ah yeah around relating to any time oh well they can hit you not a problem no I wasn't aware they actually want to see one I thought they thought we had one so did but oh I'm sure you'd have one I'm sure you're very capable of managing it yes you no no absolutely yeah yeah not a problem um yeah I think I had one more oh can you tell me more about your you know your the potential future options you see around self-funding it seemed to me that the idea was to essentially split the existing cost amongst a larger number of councils could I start with that and then amy will follow up I only learned one thing from the review mr chairman and that was that um the auckland city council gave an annual grant to their foundation of 250 000 I thought you might all be interested in that I think that that really is a sensible benchmark and uh if we ended up in that position I think that would be a very good outcome we've always had the intent of establishing a fifa service model jake and we've been working towards that we've got a number of corporate partners already that are providing that so it wouldn't just be local government that would be seeking that relationship with corporates as well so for example meridian already gives us a it's because of that generosity we could come back to you guys and ask for less money ann do you want to go through yours both of my questions have been answered thank you okay just just one on that um conflict and then we can move through on that conflicts of interest register so I mean obviously the report came to the to the trust foundation before it was sort of signed off so our understanding was you had a chance to review it uh humphrey dude yeah because it just says like in the appendix four it says that that wasn't provided I just wondered whether we'd looked at it it was probably an oversight on my behalf and I apologize for that we're in the middle of our audit at the same time that this review was underway as well as trying to write annual reports and in the middle of doing mop up for financial year for our legal requirements for the charities office I may have missed that right we're quite happy to share that okay would that is it website but it's in our minutes every day and I'm very happy to share that with all of you okay cool thank you any other questions jani thank you do you want questions of staff now as well I think the best thing is just ask what question you've got and then they can determine who's most appropriate to ask it answer it all right okay so I just was interested um and I i couldn't quite tell from the response we've had back in regards to the support agreement the annual request can you just advise what years the annual requests have been made in terms of the foundation so what years did they submit the annual budget request and what's the record of us approving up to six hundred thousand dollars that we have so we're in our fourth year currently financial year funding from you of those four years only two years we've drawn down the full 600 000 there was 580 I think in the first year and a half it wasn't a one year it we did 540. sorry my question really was to staff oh sorry what year have they received the proposed annual budget and what record is there of approving or seeking further information from the foundation um as part of that consideration so we've had two budgets from them 2021 and 1920 the reports came up to council the you considered the budgets and agreed the agreed them or noted them and I sent you that uh the resolution and the paper yesterday in response to your request I sent it for the ce's office so we've had the annual report and we have had the one the one the one report the financial um information but in terms of the two years prior we did provide them to you but it was to a staff member that's not here now right I can't talk for what happened before I came into it but there seemed to be some accepted acceptance of the view that because the money was the funding was in the ltp that it was approved and I think that's that that I think um and that's been rectified now so the foundation did submit the annual proposed budget and we just yeah we didn't_''_1264.72 I have certainly haven't seen them and don't have them and the person that did presumably receive them is no longer here do we know and it's a bit unfortunate that the deloitte authors aren't here but did they go through looking and look at the annual proposed budget they didn't ask me well uh it was part of the information they were given okay so can we get a copy of what the annual proposed budgets were from those four years no no no look I have I've got no information on those prior to 2019 20. right if you want to see that I'm really happy to sit down with you and show you all that information I would have thought as part of the review that's quite a significant well can't give them documents that I don't have that was the foundation must have them if they've submitted them we've you um the general ledger that one of the questions that has asked if they can see the general ledger from 2019 to 2020 and 20 from fifth july 30th has that has that been provided or why we're asked told to contact directly kpmg and pwc to receive whatever information they wanted as our accountants right and if that if they haven't received that I am aware they didn't actually contact and ask that so mr chairman it'd be I'd be really interested to know what this review has cost you yeah I don't have that answer now but it's really it would be less than our contribution to you I'm sure but uh yeah but um anyway um just as a general observation counselor um this review which really in my view in my language turned out to be a sort of another audit which which and and the the interesting thing about this is it's really an audit over 150 000 dollars that's the difference between salaries and wages what we're spending like when it's some fear that we get that sort of commentary yeah we're considering this report yeah that's okay I'm humphrey's entitled towards you but do you want to just keep going with your questions are we going to have a debate now about the ridiculousness or not the order no we've already heard from staff that it's balanced yeah so just in 3.4 um of the report that we had it said staff endeavoured to probe the following two key questions right into budget with the foundation without success and that was potential for achieving financial donations in the year ahead in order that some idea of value for money can be determined and the second one was whether the tree gifting and other activities that the foundation is doing that are non-financial so I'm just concerned that we do have um we have kind of had advice around um the fact that we've been unable to get answers to questions that staff have raised with the foundation and why that is so we've had several over two and a half the tui corridor work sorry this is council staff not this was before the delights review this was um from our finance and performance committee from 12th of august last year and the um the budget for 20 20 21. yes so following that humphrey and amy did come in and give you a briefing on that on the on their work program and on their budget but why why were we unable to get that information ahead of we came and briefed you on this here look I think it's fair to say that we are engaging with the foundation have been engaging with them over the past 18 months or so to try and get to a point where they understand our requirements and we understand their requirements and I think we've had some progress on that and we are getting to a point where the information that we're getting is meeting our needs right so we're so in regards to the deloitte report um the information that's been sought in terms of the quarterly reporting where when no we're no longer sitting since the report's come out we're going to sit down with amy and say these are the what we think are the deficiencies within the quarterly reporting and that's mainly around um transparency on financials and transparencies on some of these on these non-financial ones however we haven't had that opportunity yet but we will be doing that and sorry can I just be cool that we've had back and the email that I got back was that we had um uh yeah I'm happy to quote it to you but it's it says that we have um asked for that previously um so we have reported uh we have asked for reporting that is akin to that recommended by deloitte with little success I'm trying to understand given that we've historically been asking for that information why we haven't had it right so we haven't had that information because uh we haven't_''_1585.36 I believe we haven't had a robust enough conversation between the two our two parties as to why that information is needed and able to have that conversation are confident that we're going to be able to get more informed reporting that's right okay um and just I guess when you look back at the um the establishment we were sold quite clearly on the fact that rata was going to contribute um to the operational costs um and so I just wanted to check I mean both nitah and rata were holed up as groups within the city that would join in we would share operational costs so I was just really interested to understand um what contribution rata has made in terms of operational costs um and also what other parties in terms of operational funding through like naitahu or others that could could be involved going forward so we've had ongoing conversations with russia including as it was in that report which I was privy to as well the the idea was there to approach rata to see if we could collaborate to save cost saving win wins working in collaborations our conversations with rata have been ongoing in that space but we're two fundamentally different those meetings were as recent as two weeks ago is around when we do already work together around some of our distributions and when we're working alongside the same projects information sharing and in fact their chief investment officers coming to our board now we're at the point we've got money to invest to help advise our thinking around that which is incredibly useful they had none of the systems at startup that would have supported an organisation like us they aren't set up to manage donors they have a pot of money that they have they invest and then distribute the revenue off that annually we do part of that but we also have the other end of that process which is about building relationships with people that love our city and it surrounds encouraging them to gift to causes within our city and that requires quite specialist skills and software to do that so they've given us twelve and a half thousand dollars to date where we joint ventured on the vital signs project which is research we've shared with you and of residents of greater great church that is the only funding we've seen to them at this point in time to establish the foundation were we told that there was an agreement with writer foundation of an estimated 225 thousand um could I try and answer that chairman that there was I saw that draft agreement it was drafted by someone on the council and I i read through that obviously and I went and met the chief executive of right at the time and um I i mean it was a draft agreement there was um it was the I came away from that meeting thinking that the only real synergies between what they do and what we were what we are what then we were wishing to achieve was really accommodation and that would have been that would have been fine um except that their location wasn't in my view right for us secondly at that time I thought we would probably be able to get rent-free accommodation in a location that does suit us and subsequently we ended up paying you guys the rent right forward to get like because I thought that was one of the benefits when we were considering establishing it was that we had um a joint approach to supporting the city foundation so in terms of rather giving an ongoing annual operational grant is that something that's been have they like have you applied to them for no it wouldn't be an application process because we don't meet the criteria of some of their grants rounds there's certainly ongoing conversations but that's a decision made by router's board or political appointments so we need to work through that process certainly we would appreciate some operational support from so in terms of a way forward a shared partnership with a council rata naita who contribute I don't think we'll get funds from I think the more the easier place to get collaborations towards our operations is in our corporate partnership program which is already succeeding and we're already generating revenue out of that thanks cool so yani we might just move around and then if you've got more then come back just oh I'm saying um leon said about that um the trustees um haven't_''_1874.559 received any fees so it's all the trustees from the get-go yes including london the other question and I thought it was a valid question so this is the staff what has been the cost of this review now we set aside 35 000 and haven't_''_1894.48 spent that money yet okay and um so was it a surprise to see that you know the donations that were related to the mosque attack were not included yet the cost to administer it were included in this review is it to start yes the stuff uh look I do want to be clear that the benchmarking exercise was not perfect we had to work off um publicly available information it's very clear in the report that is that it's given it's indicative only um we weren't able to take out costs uh in this case the costs of the um mosque sorry the costs that the foundation incurred to manage the mosque donations that's very clearly stated in the that it would it would give an indication of where the foundation sits alongside these others we noted that the other two were had been established long before and were in kind of more of a business as usual um mode of operation whereas the foundation was new um we also noted uh that the different ways of treating the income that was coming in would throw up differences we also noted that there were different arrangements of funding across them essentially we were really just trying to give a very indicative position and and it it's come out reasonably at balanced really um it's really hard to do it's something that the sector really struggles to do and I think that the team at the council have actually tried with the best endeavors to do that and I support them in that yeah I just trying to to me though it looks like and you were saying earlier that the fact that you know we're in including donations here but not actually the cost to administer it has it's far as that skewed the in the revenue and costs of the those other two foundations there could be similar sorts of things sitting in there for example we took out the hamilton foundation's uh revenue that was came to it from the crown for the regional theatre but we couldn't identify what costs they might have incurred in in dealing with that as I said it was it's a rough look at where the foundation is sitting and it's it just is very hard to do and that's why there's a lot more information in the report other than just the benchmarking mr chair could I make an offer that we sit down together and develop a measurement framework that would serve both parties needs well let's that's that's really useful let's get around the questions and then when we get to the resolutions we'll note out here just just one more sorry yeah so putting that aside is there anything else from this review that so this is the staff as well that have I guess you know have sort of all you know there's any surprises in there anything that was unseen they've sort of come to light from this I i think we are learning as much as uh possible from this as well this sort of review um is a dual approach we've we had done a number of pieces well not me linda linda has done quite a bit of work understanding how the foundation works within our scheme of things being not a cco it's quite a difficult beast to deal with so what we learned from the from the deloitte's review is you can't ask all the questions and so therefore some things are going to be if you took an assurance review i.e an audit you'd have a different result to saying where does the foundation fit in within the philanthropy community within christchurch or new zealand it's different all the world for safe because the work that they've done offshore which will lead to future revenue I mean we haven't isolated that we haven't said that we've got zero revenue from offshore do that because there's no point um desegregating all that information what we've got here is the situations that this is musk attacks was different so therefore we we isolated that as much as we could therefore what we saw going forward is that the next budget that comes in we'll be looking at those benchmarks seeing the revenue go up seeing our costs per dollar go down and that's what we're hoping is that the assurances we've received from the trust is that with revenue going up those percentages will drop over time and that's the logic of this organization it's intergenerational we're expecting to see did we learn anything yes we have learned but I think working more closely with amy and and the chair that happens to austin it's we're going to get there we're going to get there thank you uh jake and then um just in terms of answering that big question we're dealing a lot in the theoretical in terms of what may or may not be in other foundations um actually has been raised so if you take out the 11.4 for the mosque shootings they're just over one for turranga 2.5 under contract for two so you've received one but there's another 1.45 million and then that's that you're getting yearly that's 700k yeah um no 350 per annum 700 was two years together in one payment oh okay yeah um what's the outstanding how much have you raised excluding those two things excluding turanga and the shootings one point roughly four and a bit million dollars a quick calc in my head yeah thanks uh in thank you um I very much aware that this is you're in a startup phase here still with the with the foundation and so it would be fair to say that a lot of what we're talking about is a learning process and that as the foundation continues that a lot of this will be will be dealt with and ironed out would that be fair yeah I i think the review process has been as the staff have set an excellent opportunity with each other going forward I mean my tears made it very clear and it's certainly my intent too that we are working extremely hard to remove our reliance on council funding that is our goal we've made that very clear and we've made good progress to that this year and it's our intent to do that we're acutely aware of the deadline to the end of our agreement and are working to honour that and I think what we've discovered now is that through this process there's ways that we can both work together to create great outcomes and there's a really exciting outcome coming next week where we've worked very closely with council to deliver a huge community outcome which has been funded in full and this is additional money not already in these figures to deliver a great outcome for our city and you'll all be receiving invitations to that later today so the opportunity to collaborate is clear and it's providing exciting opportunities for our city and its residents and we've certainly seen that like christchurch nz I can't praise enough the collaborative way that we work with them we're hand in glove representing the city globally because we are a global organization our focus somewhat reduced due to covert at this time is focused on helping bring new money to our city to amplify and make us a better city a better version of what we are already that's one are you sure humphrey you alluded to the fact that um auckland council gives a grant to a foundation are there other models throughout the country where that happens what do other councils well I've asked amy if she could get some data on that because it's quite interesting isn't it yeah so new plymouth district council's just gone into supporting takaraka which is their community foundation there and they've just begun supporting them because they've launched replicated our corporate partners model and launched it into new plymouth and part of that has been receiving funding from council to do that on an annual basis and from our point of view we can only and trying to distill that information out of council's reports and other everything becomes difficult unless this explicit and so therefore that's when it becomes more difficult and analyzing it as we've said is there's nothing you can pick up which shows everything on philanthropy in new zealand it just doesn't work like that yeah so just uh oh have you got any more anne are you yeah so just on that new plymouth one how much are they contributing I don't know where I can find out I was certainly happy to let you know right okay okay cool does anyone else have any jimmy uh the staff information 2.24 regarding to the course the meeting objective I just want to know these the figure the uh each donated dollar foundation incur 56.1 cents of cost this is from the beginning up to now or what is yearly yearly basis or quest time time frame this one figure um where this figure come from well the figures over the over the period of which they've been operating play two yeah I'm attack you know those the kind of of the event probably this vehicle will be increased a lot we actually came down jimmy so if you add the money we raise the fee per dollar into that calculations drops to 13 cents and a dollar so if we add that in okay okay the other one is uh 2.27 this foundation your particular emphasis is made a reduced abrasion expenditure by 24 percentage over 2019 to 20 by your volunteer you know try to reduce the 10 percent from the 600k to by 40k so this percentage difference my question is whether this reduction you know one is whether you still can meet your objective the other one these figures still escape what's the reason there you know there's a gap well could I perhaps talk to that second part of that which is the funding reduced by 10 yes but the budget the 24 relates to the budget between last year and this year so the budgeted cost they they have funding of the funding that goes goes towards their costs so their costs are higher than reduced by 24 percent our funding has reduced by 10 okay so you mean it's not only the all council grand finding to the foundation but plus some other sources together okay thank you great are there any other questions oh yanni or can I go I've got a couple and then we might go to because they might hopefully answer them so in there it talks about the fact there's 300 grand sitting for additional operating costs if needed is that correct we've used some of that money over the time so we so we had to draw down upon some of that in our support of the victims of march 15. so we incurred an additional 115 odd thousand dollars in costs over that year and a half period so that's drawed down against that so how much is left now I'd have to go and look at the specific figures because I thought it's I couldn't I'm sure it's sitting there there's three hundred no yeah that was the total amount see the size set aside in time to cover their funding costs but that's still set aside now we have a small amount of money set aside for a rainy day because we never know when something like march 15 may occur again and we need to gear up which is sadly the reality we've faced in the last 10 years in the city okay um it's interesting so the other one is just around I guess you know I raise it every time so you've got two more years of the funding cycle and it's worth noting it's up to six hundred thousand at the end of that like how confident are we we're going to get to a point because it talks about the need to have you know 17 odd million dollars and we won't be funded purely for endowment by that period of time it took acorn who's the most established community foundation 17 years to get to self-sufficiency using only an endowment model which is why we've gone to the fifa service model as well as the endowment model to on you yeah I mean it would be fair to say it would be nice to continue to have a relationship with the council beyond that date if you see value in that but I wouldn't expect it to be anywhere near at the levels that it is now yeah okay and so what work are you doing with other councils at the moment sort of touching on I'm aware that this is a public meeting so I'm really happy to have that conversation in other locations we're in the middle of negotiations with a number of other entities around operational funding right now right okay so is it fair to say then if you are doing that that come first of july the 540 that's currently on budget I would hope it would be significantly less again if this last two days hasn't had a negative impact on that right okay and um humphrey the one about the the auckland was at 250 000 so if we were to take that approach um now can you just talk like if we were to can you just talk me through how that would work you'd obviously have to go back to your board and make a few changes yes yeah um well at the end of the day chairman it's your decision as to the extent of support you want to give to philanthropy in christchurch that's the first question the second is do you want to do it through the christchurch foundation so assuming you come to a conclusion on that then I think it would be appropriate to benchmark us off or off the sort of running average of new zealand cities you know um just just come to a sort of a sensible dollar sun and uh and if if that was if if we could wave a magic wand and say that would be your policy come the end of this funding period then we would uh 100 pick up the balance of that funding ourselves of the cost to run the foundation okay it might mean some adjustment in our current structure if we hadn't got secured agreements but I have no doubt that we in what way would we exist and how yeah how quickly we could have impact for our city would be significantly reduced yeah sure okay thank you yeah um jani I just just just want to be clear on a few things um one is that from council staff's point of view there's nothing of concern in the proposed budgets that have been put forward in terms of the operational cost of the foundation we're waiting on the next set of budgets aren't we we haven't written them because we're new our financial year is the same as yours so that that's one july one july so we're about to start our budgeting process for the next financial year but I thought we had to do that by the end of is at the end of march or the first of march no I'm going to give you we will have a a three year forecast for you at the end of april beginning of may so we need to so for this year's for the upcoming budget yeah we well we actually need to do it well before then um because we have to go back to the foundations end of april will have it yeah yes so in the pre in the previous two years with the budgets has there been anything of concern of councils any concerns that council staff have had around the cost of operations or the foundation in regards to the money that we've done um I don't know so much well yeah I suppose our concerns have been driven out of needing to understand more about what sits beneath the numbers but we're very conscious that this is not a cco and we we can't go um it's really up to the board to set its its budget and to some extent we have to we have to go with the the board's requirement to act in the best interests of the trust but if we're giving like 600 grand and we see 400 grand for marketing we'd probably go right so and we rely on good on in good faith on the foundation's behind for example the marketing budget that it had in view it has in view of covert and the closed borders which means that they're switching say funding from travel into a heightened marketing program you know it makes sense and we've and that's our probing of that has okay so the key process for us going forward is to get a resolution by may around what we're going to a fund so um the process for us to consider the budget and get staff advice that will just happen in terms of regular reporting yes to the finance and performance committee yes um and at that stage that's the opportunity for us to consider the quantum and the concern around any appropriation of the budget in terms of how the foundations I'm happy to receive that and table that at our meeting so I guess the other key thing from the deloitte report really it seems to be around the transparency um there's a number of things that you know and appreciate whether there'll be some commercial sensitivity there's a the the information in terms of value for money but also outcomes so just want to be really clear that the conflicts of um sorry the register uh for both the trustees in terms of the conflicts of interest um and the trustees interest sorry declaration of interest in the trustees conflicts uh trustees register that will be provided so there's no way there's no issue there will be able to see that yep is is that public information or is it it can be I don't have a problem with that yeah so I think that's good there's nothing to hide that will give confidence to to people around one of the concerns that's been raised in the report I think the reference to the conflict of interest is there's some confusion around um some of my giving so to be very clear up until this year my company perception which now longer doesn't put into hiatus used to give fifty thousand dollars a year in pro bono services um and deloitte didn't know how to kind of box that as well so um I have just cut that stopped that which is disappointing for the foundation and that was one of the reasons I took a reduction in my salary was because I strongly believe in this model so much so I've got skin in the game so amy just on that perception pr stuff so did you have staff doing that work or was that you it was staff doing that work all right so you're paying so it wasn't you doing any of it no right it was additional pro bono services after fifty thousand dollars a year yeah sure yeah and the other thing that's mentioned here's the procurement policy so again you've you've got a procurement we're not a cco we don't operate like a cco so you don't have any money to procure yeah yeah so I know you're trying to within the framework I guess the concern is like when you um spend operational money that we're giving you on services the process around procuring that we would go to market which is normal business activity yeah okay and just the final thing is really probably a question for staff maybe the foundation do you think we need to change the supply agreement to get better clarity around some of these issues so that we don't have this kind of situation happening in the future part of what we're doing is we asking the trustees and the man to come to council to explain things as we do with the other ccos and and that model is work will work better in the future and it means that if we're in regular communication with each other especially at governance to governance level um it'll actually help the relationship going forward and understand where everybody stands and how much skin everybody's got in the game as they missed and you know the invitation is very much open to come and chat and sit and look through stuff we can show you information quite happily that we can't put into the public realm and I have trust with this group here that we can do that and't go into the public role yeah I guess I would I would like to see stuff documented as because we've already heard that one of the issues if it's people-to-people is that if a person goes there's no record oh I completely understand that that was pretty frustrating the other thing I would possibly add to that is that the information that we have identified as being required in the quarterly reporting with with the foundation's agreement to provide that sort of information then I think the support agreement is fine also yani we might just move to aaron and then we'll try and conclude this if we can yeah um amy you keep um offering to meet with councillors and so on and so forth how many have come and met with you and sat down and gone through all their concerns none none none who've come to see us and ask us for more information right all right thanks for that helpful suggestion aaron any other questions I I'm a big fan of the old hilly yeah talk it out directly to people right I need to meet with mike a few times have we got any more questions jimmy and then we try and one more and okay because based on the paraguay 2.7 even the foundation the volunteer reduced the 60 000 k from the 600 to the 541 but in here particularly mentioned the uh council the supporters criteria is you know once every three months they will present the foundational presenter council the kind of uh even they have uh the proposed annual budget the case flow statement in any other relevant document and also the you know reasonable review essay tool and also on the quota quarterly activity the budget forecast my question is even this is criteria but whether still possible you know will be esco escalation or not in a annual basis up to the july 1st 20 sweep still have a two two years plus to go am I right two years yeah two years yeah still possible or not these are 16 funding videos I'd like to reduce it significantly more it's a wish to reduce it remember I your practical kind of the radio for mining the service etc based on your learn would that reduction impact yeah services uh it would if if we had a significant cut in funding from the council for the new financial year we'd have to very quickly move to find a fill or adjust our model that's the reality oh yeah okay thank you okay great so we need to we're there basically uh right so we've got some resolutions on the table I've actually got one which I think is probably a good workaround based off your comments um before amy around the fact you're going out and trying to talk with others about funding that operating cost so what I might do is just get david to put them up and see whether people are comfortable with this approach it's a far more pragmatic than I think what's there now that's true don't worry it doesn't mention sideways I'm packing with my glasses in a nutshell it's essentially going to say that we won wouldn't and it'll go through the long term plan but what we'll do is we'd prefer that you come back um you know now that we've had time to flesh this out with you I think in a really healthy way um after you've gone and sort of got other partners to help fund that and then and look to reduce that amount so I think that's sort of a sensible approach if people are comfortable with it I think david's going to try and wordsmith it okay so it's just up there so that's easy to read we can make it bigger too if it helps foundations provides advice quarterly reporting progress on thank you on achieving this value perfectly yeah that's easy done yeah cool sounds very fair and reasonable no it'll just be I mean yeah they'll bring back something I just think clearly you need a bit more time to go away and work with the other partners to try and get some money in to fund those operating costs and this might line through it today yeah no no that makes perfect sense yeah happy to do that yeah but that'll feed part of but basically this has to be done by the long-term plan so if if is right so can we that's a valid point lynn or linda can you just explain what I want to know is are they are those recommendations there in a nutshell going to mean that we're not making decision on the funding today or albeit it's in the draft ltp at the moment but there'll be a proposal come back from the foundation that in time for the the ltp sign off uh we can settle on an amount yes I said before chairman we will have information to you at the end of april sorry humphrey if I can just the technical I just want to make sure technically ldp includes funding up to 540 000. if we receive their budgets and you decide that it's 500 there's no problem if you decide it's 700 there's a problem yeah I don't think we this works yes so yani is that giving you some comfort or do you want that change so we get rid of the one to four if that's okay yeah I just think it'll give you a bit more time to make it work and then we can all go in and have a sensible approach on what level of funding it and then you know you're that process cool so I'm happy to move that jake's happy to second it is there any discussion did you want to just make reference to the information that in the devoid report that stuff yeah yeah hang on I'll just wait till that can you just move that tick box then it's a request that the crusher financial provides advice on its quality reporting is to progress on achieving third-party funding operation admin costs but also um including the um the advice from deloitte's over what we should be getting yeah I think I think I thought without going into it that delegates responsibly do you want the chief executive just to do that through the advice of the key matters yes yeah I think the resolution as it originally stands is fine yeah I think it's clearly the relationship between the staff and christchurch foundation is collectively improving and I expect that to continue yeah and I think probably the message for oh yeah so comfortable so let's move seconded is there any debate that's perfect the only thing I'd just say is that like thank you for coming in and doing this it's actually really helpful I'm pleased we could do it in a public environment given you know how it's put out probably the message I've got from this is please go away and get some other funders to help with the operating costs I know you will yeah and hopefully this gives you both the time to go away and make that work work with the staff and then we can come back with a sensible approach for the long-term plan so yeah I'm very interested in that perfect perfect thank you so much for your time and thanks for having favor say aye all right against that's carried excellent thank you all for thank you thanks everyone
Moving on to the next item item eight the capital project performance report um so ruth welcome to the table thank you for joining us um and if we can just take any introductory remarks first of all then we'll move to questions thank you michonne thank you did you hear me do you want me to repeat myself okay cool so I'll make some general comments on the content of the report got the delivery unit leads in the room to answer any specific questions uh you will notice that there has been a slight change in the project names within the report and this will be ongoing they won't change any further but we have done a complete review of our project names changing our naming convention so that they are a little bit more understood by our citizens as well as internally so those project names will be reflected in the long-term plan and in our long-term plan tool so in terms of the content of the report our financial year position since last report to the committee external funding from our shovel ready financial year budget so that has increased our financial year budget from 513 million which we reported in november at 552 million in terms of our forecasts page 44 we're now reporting the core program separately from the external funded and the multi-use and the metro this just ensures that we can continue to provide a good view on how we're tracking to deliver on the core program and that's our core commitments from the financial year 21 annual plan so against the core program of 375 mill project managers are forecasting 398.5 against the external funded six six of six six point nine uh forecasting a spend of 53.6 across the whole program we're looking to see an overall carry forward of 35.7 million based on the data from our project managers you'll see that there's a detailed carry forward and bring back information on page 49-53 so forecasts to the end of financial year uh you will see from pages 45 to 48 there's some pretty decent forecasts coming up in the months ahead there are specific commentary in relation to forecasts to that level so I'm going to make some general comments on the current position that we're in in order to deliver on those forecasts but if you have any specific queries in relation to the delivery programs then I'll be deferring to the delivery heads so in terms of general comments spend to date at december was 193.5 this is an improved position at the same time last year of 188. so with an out turn last year 380 despite covert we're on track to deliver a similar or a better result to validate that we have 243 projects in construction at the moment forecasting 299 and that compares to last year of 225 forecasting 237. so from that original forecast of 237 last year despite covert we still delivered 190 our core program is forecasting a bring back of 9.5 so that's also a very unique situation from previous years usually by this point we're forecasting a pretty reasonable carry forward so that means we are in an improved position to accommodate any unforeseen issues within that program that may occur program remains focused on delivering to that 375 and finally our forecast accuracy so in the last 12 rolling months we have been around about 90 accuracy covert claims page 54 in the last committee report we had paid out 72 we're now sitting at 93 um of all claims and interim and final costs having been paid out so we are at the end of the negotiations uh with only four claims left to be resolved I will now take any questions thank you um so thanks for the update obviously that bring back of 9.9 or 9.5 that's something that we'll be keeping an eye on over the next few months um deliverability of 50 million a month or in excess of 50 million a month for the rest of the financial year have you got a high level of confidence in that been able to be delivered it seems quite ambitious just keen to get some further commentary around that yeah definitely so it is ambitious when you compare it to previous years but in terms of the position we are with projects in years as well there are three kind of delivery units that are driving those forecasts and so I thought it would be quite helpful for the committee to hear from them directly so transport are forecasting 55 three waters are forecasting 75 in major facilities 40. so I think it'd be good maybe richard lynette if transport then three waters and facilities could kind of speak to how they've got their program set up to deliver on the current forecasts yeah because certainly that 50 or 50 plus does seem ambitious but you know if we've got a high level of confidence around that then that's excellent um from transport's perspective we do in the sense that we have a large number of works in train and they are contracted so the bulk valves sit either with major cycleways that are shut already funded um and we've got currently about five or six contracts running um on top of that we've got our maintenance contracts and other big contracts like martians road bridge dyer's pass barriers so there's there's a confident that it's a realistic and pragmatic estimate of what we're going to spend excellent thank you it's good to hear john presently we've got about 70 million dollars out in the out in the market being evaluated or in tender we've got about 15 million dollars in land purchase being lined up for expenditure this financial year and we're also in delivery of a significant program in our stormwater area right as we speak as this is our delivery period in the in the drier period so it's looking pretty good we've had some savings which have suppressed a bit of what appears to be spend and that has been redirected to next year's renewals and renewals of lead jointed pipes so in that space I think that the three waters delivery is pretty much as described in the reports so you're confident that the contribution to the 50 million or thereabouts a month that we're looking at coming from three waters you're confident that that is deliverable as planned yes I am thank you excellent thank the three projects in particular are um one is a a bring back which is to uh linwood pools which is uh is bringing back some money uh the two other projects cmua and metro sports facility metro sports facility being the larger of the two and and that's regarding the forecast that's been presented to us by otagoro and from a council perspective we monitor that every month and we pay against the invoices that come in but again their forecast is compounded by the carving 19 issues and their program issues um they won't um provide a um a reforecast until their financial year end is completed with regards to cmua cmua predicted sums that were in indicative forecasts that were given to us right at the very early days we're uh we're now in a conclusion of an rfp which is in negotiation uh with a with a preferred tenderer and it's a due process that we're going through and once we're through that process we'll have a revised forecast which will inform the next year's spend is that the um metroid sports facility given that it's not a project that we're constructing or delivering um is out of control and we're relying on information that's provided to us um obviously you're getting those monthly updates and you're feeding those into what we see um yeah it's it's worth um pointing that out because of course that's not a project which has been delivered by council and and uh john bridgeman did attend council at the last meeting to uh to outline where they were at correct yeah all right thank you um ruth I think it's been incredibly helpful having unit managers come in front of us to to provide that level of confidence um you know it's great that you're providing figures in a report at a high level but I think you know particularly at this stage in the year it's good for us to hear that level of confidence coming from unit managers that in turn can give us a level of confidence that once these numbers are ambitions they up that way was there anything else that you wanted to say before we move to questions I just think uh to your point um with the committee's agreement um the way that the deliverability commentary by month is currently provided in the report could be split out by delivery unit so that you can see the contribution each delivery unit is making to that month given the comments I just made I think that would be really helpful thank you right so now moving to questions aaron yeah um a couple ruth one is um under the some of the risks when we have uh oh sorry page 57 um under exchange rate uh at you know any hike in the us dollar may impact project costs at present this is not impacting project cost but has the potential to do so but it can go the other way as well which it has since the election the um us dollars weakened considerably so we're about 10 cents better off now does that factor in that way do we get it do we get a win or we locked in the contract the dollar was that so we'll do that but when it goes the other way they'll go oh dolla's gone up I don't know the detail of the costs that we get on each specific project so that would probably be a question for delivery units yeah highlighted for going when the dollar goes north but when it goes south which it has done since the election um thank goodness um uh it it's quite a lot so oh um lanes is that something that you can I can comment tell too but I can't necessarily answer the detail of the question um when we set up our contracts it does depend on how those contracts are set up so if it is dependent on fluctuating if materials are dependent on fluctuating exchange rates and we take that risk then we take the risk by the way also we do get a win sometimes yep cool um that's good to hear and then the other one is on the contracts and the claims that were being made um of companies that had put in light wage subsidy claims end up paying back because their end of year results were a lot better than expected in fact some are even better than if you hadn't had covert are those come any of those companies that have paid back the wage subsidy still putting a claim into the council we haven't because they've had a really good year we haven't received any new claims in any of the any withdrawn that claims that we have uh the contractual claims that we have paid out on have been under the conditions of the contract so they have been for materials of works done that weren't included or that weren't considered because so they're a variation to the contract so the claims that we have made have been under the terms and conditions of the contract and under contract law the how the companies run their business is their business and we haven't got into that that is not what we've done in these claims yeah yeah so I mean contracts were written a very different year so yes they can claim because of time loss and things like that so yeah they put in well they actually had to do extra work or types of work that they didn't intend having to do at the start of the contract right so we have to pay for that so for example when we knew we were going into lockdown and we had our contractors up on cranford street we asked them to close the site and get rid of the cones so that the people living on that street weren't living in amongst a work site for four six eight weeks so they put extra ash felt down that they didn't have you know they closed up pits they didn't intend to have to do so they did work that they didn't intend to have to do and we have to pay for that yeah yeah and that's it and that's what our claims have been also the only thing that's what our private claims are brilliant so there's none for I can't a question I would ask of the biz that's that's how they run their business our claims are under our contract for items that they have done and they're entitled to under their contract okay so yeah all right thank you jimmy two questions first one on page 62 uh regarding to the one or watch the list the whole junction extension particularly here the risk you know mitigate I just want to know uh regarding the key where program works you know all those kind of real closing potential land contamination my question concerns because this forecast delivered date will be in may of 2020 to only one year plus whether it is under control or out of control this risk it's definitely under control no problem okay thank you second question the south expressed a particular stage one from templeton to the high high low those one we enter into a detailed design by the community their particular concern the particular traffic petition work with the accepted issue stop particular mention where will be you know the presenter to the community ball and also accounts has been reflected to our detailed design second is now my understand favorite didn't happen whether it's postponed too much or not so the design has been undertaken and the community concerns have been taken into consideration we are having continuing discussions with the community and the community group as you're aware about the concerns along waterloo road and others as part of that we have brought forward the construction of the is at hornby primary the this the crossing outside hornby primary on high high road so that is going to be delivered early ahead of the delivery of the rest of the of the cycle way in that area south express cycleway has currently has three contracts underway another one in tinder and another one due to tinder in a couple of months so we're getting out towards high high road now we've always been building it from the city out we are having continuing discussions with the residence group as I said and we have a briefing with the community board with all of the community board um on the night of march but that is to take into account all the concerns that are being raised in that area staff are also looking at whether there's other things that can be done so that will all be discussed at the briefing thank you um jimmy just on the keyway real matter um that you raised in the first question um I raised with minister grant robertson exactly that issue as an example of a number of issues that are happening around the country at the moment he's very aware um obviously the government have got a focus on mode shift and climate change issues um he's very aware of that issue um so it's been picked up at that level as well so with it through the chair we've seen benefit of that conversation thank you very much excellent it's good to know that a joined up approach is working excellent one of shower related program now and also it's kind of severe the delay for several years you know community and the basic critique concerning this project yep so we've got just got a question on um page 60 I think about the saint orbans community centre um can you explain notes so the current approved budget the current forecast and the actual state so approved and forecast is 3.9 million and then what does that mean I always thought it was 3.2 um the total life to date budget since inception is 3.9 um sorry can you say that again the total life to date budget all of start to finish is 3.9 and that's what we're forecasting too here that's what ruth's report shows us oh I was under the impression it was 3.2 so um and it it's nearly finished yeah great news the team are on site at the moment um we're looking to issue practical completion within the next 10 days which gives us a clear month out till the opening on the day we're going to come in under the 3.9 we're going to come in this will be a successful project delivered under budget okay that's great for me to hear because there's a them one of them is really really important it's the actual name on the side of the building I've bought a colleague who can talk to that paul so my understanding is that richie moyle who's the project manager is attending the community board next week he is looking at options in relation to the name of to the name and what is the design of the particular name that is well the news to date in all fairness is the feedback we've had at the board is that there's no budget for a sign on the building there's a sign for a freestanding site funding for freestanding side outside um and the quote that they've had is twelve thousand dollars to put a name on the building so the important thing to add though is the sign was originally in the design yeah it's taken off to reduce the the cost of that so we're actually under budget that should be reinstated so can we take that offline from this meeting um but can we make sure it's taken handled and dealt with yes because I mean richie's done a wonderful job there but sometimes I get the feeling that his hands are tied when it comes to budget allowances and he's really trying to stick to the 3.2 but for me a sign and a good sign on the building we have unofficially decided we've been gifted a maori name as well is really really key it's an amazing looking building and it would be such a shame to have it let down without a really good uh naming on the side of it paul and I are very happy to talk to you so let's take that offline let's see whether we can get to an ideal outcome which is a project that still comes in on the budget but with a sign attached to the outside of the building so is there any chance that we could get the accessibility ramp off the deck then at the same time can we take this conversation offline there are clearly a number of features this are going to be applicable just the got yani and then sarah yani yeah I was just um just thinking of the residence in oldport place um around the um littleton harbour wastewater scheme I mean that street has basically since the earthquake had works in it that project's now looking like it's delayed again um there seems to be a whole bunch of issues with it is there anything that we can do to um address it if it's delayed can we make it look nice and a bit like what we heard before or can we get good communication to those residents about what's actually going on there had been a delay with the delivery of a bespoke valve for that position and they were undertaking some work on the valve pit which was expected to be completed around about now and we were going to disestablish and tidy it up communicate with the residents and then come back in two months time when we expected that valve to arrive from overseas so it should all be tidied up now very soon yes right and has there been a notice go talking to the residents continually about the progress can we get like stuff like normally at a community level would get a start work notice on things but I mean I've gone back through yeah I i guess in that space um because it's work in progress there hasn't been um any further start work notices because it's actually started right okay I mean it's just quite common that we would get like an update when if things are delayed or you know so anyway I'll just feed that back but it's good to hear that um that's that's on track um I just um wanted to thank staff for organizing a site visit to the chillm street brick barrel I just thought it was actually it's actually really good when you um get an opportunity to see firsthand what some of the issues are particularly with projects that are that are red so I just wanted to acknowledge that and say that um you know if there were opportunities going forward I think it's really valuable to hear why things may not be us if count if councillors have um a specific interest in a project we would invite you to come and talk to us and we'd be very happy to show you around any of them great um I just said there was another one here that had the levels wrong um and I was just sorry I just can't quite find it but it said that we were having to go back because the levels were wrong in terms of the the work that was done um so yeah I was just concerned about that I'm sorry I just can't just freaking through should we come back to you yoni once you've found that yeah I had another question about the um the the arena um sorry the metro sports facility it says delays are due to slower progress than current construction program um construction program currently being reviewed by contractor and otakuro uh like have we got any idea what's happening there why it's delayed what the problem is I mean this has been something that's it's been on track and now it seems like something's fun something's going wrong I think we can um I can't talk directly to how the project managing that project um we're obviously cognizant that there's been a great deal of work uh occurred over the last few months certainly within the structural steel and the cladding and they're showing great progress there's no doubt and but there'll be a massive catch-up that they're in the process of doing um they can make big headways into structural steel programs and erection of steel and cladding for the exteriors in the pools but they are ultimately in delay and they are working through that progress and it's a it is a contractual uh discussion that otakura will be having with cpb as the main contractor and today they're indicating that there's a possibility of time being pulled back but you can see from the spend forecast that that's not actually occurring so it's a pretty obvious point that they are going to be in delay we is we we don't have any sense of it a year no we can't tell I can't tell you that because I can't tell you what their program of work is they have not updated the program they've not come back to us because they're in contractual discussions with cpp so but it's obvious from the spend forecast that they're in delay because you need to meet a dollar spent in order to get to where you've got to go to all right okay if we wanted a fuller update an idea might be to get um john john bridgeman back at some point either to the next iteration of this meeting so martin luther yes through the chair sorry mark noonan represents council's interest from uh the management of the the contract from our side uh so I'll talk to mark when he's back at work and we'll discuss getting john and their financial team in the room to discuss how they're gonna how they're going with progress and how they're going with interest for us I mean it may well be that things have moved on or we've got more certainty within the next month before the next meeting but it will be good to get an update um so that we know exactly where we're at just on page 59 I just had um three questions um hereford street bridge surface replacement it says there's a forecast overspend to signal pole relocations and the project manager is currently reviewing budgets in order to confirm final cost um there was also some discussion around the bollards as well so um it's not mentioned in that specific one I think was mentioned in a different one so I'm just kind of curious when we um what's the pro the change process for hereford straight if there's significant extra cost because I guess with the bollards I wasn't really happy the way that that process the cost seemed to go up quite considerably and I don't think we had good visibility of that so are we going to get a report to council um any that will be undertaken will be undertaken as per the great financial delegations that we work within so all council decision making on that project is complete everything that remains to be done is either within the project or within staff delegation is that correct and if it's not it will be reported back to council so the so choosing the cost of the bollards based on the terror risk like I don't recall us ever getting a report saying here's the options simply money was added and the budget was increased considerably the discussion was had at the annual plan session so that that that my understanding is the bollards um the discussion was had at the annual plan last annual plan there was an increase in the line item but there was no specific report that said you know based on the terror threat where where we're spending there was briefings too in discussions with the um appropriate committee about that one from memory there were two briefings um from a decision-making point of view the whole the whole matters within staff delegation but where we provided guidance um which has then um influenced the way that staff have exercised their um ability to um delegate that's exactly right and um and the changes in budget were brought through the annual plan process yeah okay um I just find it weird like you know saint albans can't_''_1747.919 get twelve thousand dollars for a sign gets taken off and they're struggling and we've got significant okay can we stick to questions thank you um the uh the other question was in the um in seoul's firefield louis and main renewal wastewater the contract is complete her additional stage is now required 80 meters upstream to correct a level discrepancy and replace poor condition pipes um so I was just trying to check why that wasn't picked up at the start of the project there was a survey era and when they came to connect to the manhole they found that the pipe didn't match at the appropriate level so the resolution to that was to extend the laying of the pipe and bring forward the replacement of another the following financial year is will there be like a close-out report that that determines how that could occur because it seems pretty basic um it was a survey era by one of our consultants um we could talk to them about their professional indemnity but the loss to the council is effectively nil because it was pipe that was going to be replaced anyway all right okay and the final question I had was on the um just on the top one the water supply reactive water meter renewal additional budget required to find water meter replacement so fy21 a change request of 2.9 million has been submitted I know we've also got a smart water smart meter water smart water maker program as well and I think I'm just trying to understand at what point do we make the call to go to a smart meter technology rather than bring forward money to do that existing replacement so we are going to run a trial of smart meters out in the rafferty zone and following that trial we will look at the roll out across the the moment the so-called dumb meters can be upgraded by putting the smarts on top so we won't be closing off any options by putting those meters in but there'd be a huge additional cost to retrofitting and making no there would be a very small additional cost so you just pop them on top so it won't cost a lot that's correct yeah and the um the reactive water meter replacement program is to address the leaks at the toby boxes that are being reported around the city so um instead of doing uh repairs on those toby boxes where the meters are quite elderly we're replacing the whole meter assembly and that means that we don't come back two or three times and we're also improving the backflow prevention at those sites so what's the cost of just putting in a replacement meter as we're doing now versus putting in a smart meter versus coming back and putting a smart thing on at a later date I have to come back to you with those precise costs okay thank then aaron and then james sarah I know I can take mine offline to save time all right thank you aaron yeah mime's just around the um synorbons uh community centre is that um approximately 400 meters square meters is that the size or is it bigger it is approximately 400 square meters and is that price the three nine is that the build cost or was that including the land purchase that's everything required from start to finish to deliver the project it's not the construction cost it's not the land cost it includes a number of things the purchase of 130 caledonian road um staff time resource consent everything you need to deliver the project so so not because so if you're trying to if you get if you're I'm preempting a question about square meter costs potentially yeah you like you do with most projects like if I was going to buy a house so when the qs bottoms it out we've got an external as we do on all our jobs a professional consultancy running the numbers on final square metre cost thank you yep if we can get that just by way of a memo or an email that'd be perfect thank you yeah yeah well you take off the land costs and then every other build cost for the actual box yep so if you can provide the cost and the basis on which you've arrived at it that would be excellent thank you okay um james actually my questions of um through you ruth to helen is that possible so helen if we can um bring you back to the table so I'm guessing this is on a water matter sorry I didn't realize that she was leaving no that's all right no problem it's good that we've got the right people in the room for all these questions just quickly about the smart meter trial in the rafiti zone um what what was the reason for using that area that that zone has recently been disconnected from the central zone if you like and we chose that because it's got a number of new pump stations to test the technology uh and we um yeah we just regard that as the best spot for it I like the answer but I just want to check that doesn't that wouldn't mean that that zone would be the first to pay excess water charges no it won't make any difference we can advance that if you wish we could use this that was a statement not a question okay all right thank you all right so there any more questions on this um capital project performance report okay so I'm happy to move this do I have a seconder um aaron is there any debate all those in favor say aye against that's carried thank you now moving on to item 9 the water services bill draft submission now this has been the subject of
There are none um presentation of petitions item six there are none so that brings us to the performance exceptions report for january and peter welcome to the table and I'll just ask you to make any remarks on this report before we move to questions thank you good morning thank you uh the overwhelming uh impression of this report is stability results are very much the same for levels of service and capital as there were in the last report um we've got some of the key managers here to help answer questions on some of the levels of service exceptions if that's required um but we're sitting at um just over 80 on level of service delivery uh compared to 81 and a bit for uh september last year so very stable uh view um having said that uh my team and the executive team have developed a process for targeting levels of service that might be salvageable before year end so rather than a flat report that lists everything we're now taking those ambers to the executive team and working with the where you're quite close with a bit of extra effort focused teamwork intervention it's possible these could be brought over the line by year end and so for the second half of the year there's quite a focus on getting those that might be rescued and hopefully that 80 will go up to the 85 that you were looking for there's not many required to do it and the focus is there um we'll look at specific ones when we get to the exceptions appendix at the back in terms of the capital program uh the watch list this is watchlist projects in whole of life which is a different view from from what the project management office will give you for the current year we're sitting at 90 percent uh you might notice from the historical trends graph there that both the major cycleways and watchlist projects are significantly tighter compared to the historic norms um and the watch list has only really been at 90 once before since july 18. so both sets of work are coming in very close uh being's not much point in laboring some of the other graphs because they simply reflect that stability around the level of service delivery and that takes us through the through to the um exceptions themselves at this point um I'll just remind you that um I endeavor to answer the questions I can but these these cover the entire spectrum of council services and there will be times when I can't answer and we need to defer to the subject matter expert we have helen here who can talk to any of the three water issues but if it's a particularly technical issue I may have to ask you for permission to come back with a report from the manager concerned rather than answering it on the spot so if there are any questions about the exceptions I'm happy to take them now or go back to the subject matter expert as required there is also one level of service proposed for deletion and we have some wording in the resolution on that that is the level of service around supporting business sector resource efficiency there the budget for that was cut in the last annual plan the level of service that goes with that budget should have also been deleted so the area is now seeking permission from council to formally delete that level of service that won't trigger any consultation implications it's not a significant level of service in a significant activity council can decide to delete it we just need to notify audit to cover any reporting implications at your end so uh with that um does anybody have any questions about the exceptions themselves all right thank you um peter and and thanks for highlighting you know one of the key features of this report is is stability um that's is that something that we're expecting to to continue to to be a theme until year end by and large when you're at this point in the year you're seeing very close to what you'll get at year end that's historically the pattern um that doesn't mean something can't_``_272.32 happen we've certainly learned that over the years but um by and those last that last five percent that we can find rather than seeing any great volatility and thanks for drawing attention to that new what you might call targeted intervention approach um that's highlighted in paragraph 1.5 and 1.6 in the report and thanks for highlighting that and then my my only other question relates to the um level of service that's the subject of that additional recommendation so this is the second bullet point on page 21 of our agenda um out of the five new levels service exceptions this month three are forecast red will fail to meet target two in strategic planning and policy for supporting business sector resource efficiency this target will not be met because the consultancy budget was removed following the coveted lockdown budget review so what we're saying peter is that this was simply an error where we move we removed the funding and we made an error in not removing the corresponding levels of service at the same time that's correct it was a um a difficult time of year for the staff and it's simply an at that time so just uh um I guess more of a technical question the report refers to two levels of service in strategic planning and policy and the resolution just refers to one level of service is there a is there a second level of service that should be added into this resolution no the resolution's correct it refers to um level of service 17.0.34.2 um while there are two that are exceptions only one is proposed for deletion and that's the resource efficiency one so the other one stands yes so we're expecting to continue we're expecting to meet the level of service or to continue monitoring that level of service on the other one that's right it stands so there was no error with one the one in the resolution is the one that there was an error with yes all right that's fine thank you very much all right moving to other questions yummy just just note on the pt infrastructure that we're um target's 86 percent can you give page numbers um the monthly average is 77 action because we've invested a lot in um public transport bus priority lanes down ricketton road and maine north road and so are we able to get some sort of evaluation of what's causing the delay and what effectiveness that investment has had because some of us have raised continuously the concern that although we spend a lot of money on those projects the benefit that we actually get for journey time isn't being matched because of other things that happen along that corridor and you know maine north road was a classic where we put a civilized pedestrian crossing um that stopped traffic at the same time we put a clear way in for the bus to increase it's it's it's flow so I'm just concerned that we have a better remedial action than that one um to really understand what's causing the problem given the amount of money that we've invested in it that that's a completely fair observation I'll work with richard to come back to you with a more detailed uh a remedial action that this is a horrible thing to do that lynette may be able to help okay um through you mr chair in terms of the bus priority measures throughout christchurch we we don't actually have a comprehensive program or suite or network of of bus priority measures we we have a lot of bits and parts of the network which work they work okay to put it bluntly um they're not very well aligned at this stage and hence the reason why the organisation has approved the business case late last year to put more investment into public transport and ensure that those key routes the the five key routes do have um public transport priority measures along them but at the moment there are a lot of gaps in those key corridors so that's one of the reasons why you will see that level of service that we struggle to meet of course as you'll be aware we also don't run the buses and there's only so much we can do as an organisation to improve on that we can provide the pt priority which influence the efficiency of the bus service and we're just a bit player on that so sorry can we get can we get a report back then or a memo on the journey time savings that have accrued to the bus priority loans that we've put in and what what the expected outcome was when we approved the project versus what's actually happened since those bus lanes are in is that something we could get um could you tell me a project you're referring to you referring to the road ones or the rugged road ones there's rickett road and there's papua new york so that yeah look in terms of rickard and rowe in terms of papinois road we we put some measures in pre-quake but there was always a gap on main north road of which we've addressed recently so um but there's still gaps in that network if you look at merivale as well obviously that the buses get held up along there so we haven't got a continuous network of priority measures with respect like my the basis of which we've made it to get the benefit how do we know how that's performing that's all I'm interested in the chair is too early for this data in all fairness rich is telling us that it's not complete yet so we can't really it's mr chair it's a bit like putting in um so you've got a major cycle away and you're putting a couple of sections and you've left out another section of course it's not going to work at an optimal manner if you put in the whole program that's when you get the benefits and that's what the business case the council endorsed prior to christmas I understand that but when we approved we had a big debate at this council and we were given um benefit journey times of approving the expenditure right and all I'm asking for is to understand what's happened with those journey times not the whole route appreciate that for the whole road it'll be different right but for the ones council on the basis of this is the improvement that's going to happen we must be able to measure that so has the improvements do so has the project delivered the improvements that were expected realizing that that's only a small part of and I'm not expecting stuff to answer that today but I think when you look at this performance measure and see that we're not meeting that um target it would be good to understand the nature of the investment that we've made and the benefits that we expected to see whether it's happened or not all right so richard are you able to take that away and come back to us with an answer which may reflect the answer that you've provided verbally but there may be something that goes back to the information that was put in front of council when we made that decision and whether we're achieving what was expected um from the decision that we made at that time comparing what's happening on the ground to um service improvements that we expected from mr g I can come up with something thank you thanks um and just the final question for me was on page 30 um and it's just looking at the um roads and footpaths that respond to customer service requests within appropriate time frames and it says changes are still required to the hybris sla response times pending provision of transport ticket structure it's a key priority change is already made of seanchua reporting better reflecting a response to currently 80 compared to 33 that was being reported and greater than 80 years council's typical target which is now being achieved that I just found that section quite confusing um so basically our target is um greater than 95 um we've got a typical target that's lower than that and there's a change to the system which has increased it from 33 to 80. so essentially um what that's largely referring to is a transport maintenance contracts and within them we have different response times across the board so depending on what it is um you know that the maintenance contractor should be something more substantive that that takes months within which for us to come up to a solution with the problem when um you know these were initially put in through the um hybris system um that probably didn't reflect the range of response times in there so that was the rationale for that the low percentage because some of the things we were just never going to do within a 24-hour turnaround time and that's what we had for some of those things so say you've got someone who complains about a um a pothole on a road now if we were coming along a month later and resurfacing that road we wouldn't go in and fall in the pothole now what that might have shown on hybris is that we failed our level of service because we have a 48 hour turnaround time for potholes or something like that but but you know that was a deliberate fail if if for one of a better description because we wouldn't want to do something twice so now hybris better reflects what our turnaround times are we're getting up to a level of circa 80 it's not as good as we'd like it to be but it's a significant improvement on what it was previously I think the challenge for us this year is that you know in transport we get 30 36 odd thousand hybris tickets a year this year that the trend in numbers seems to be higher than what we've had in previous years so you know it's it's it's we're struggling to keep up with the demand for them so just I mean I just wanted to acknowledge the um the the um the the team that do the water supply the reporting that we got eventually in the memo was excellent and it gave a really good breakdown around the response times and where we were failing and what we were delivering on and I thought actually that's quite good I wonder if we can get something similar for transport because it is quite hard just to look at this and kind of understand but I think it was really really here's the extent of the problem here's the ones that we're currently meeting the target for the urgent um here's the ones that are overdue and here's the process to get caught up yeah this is just a high very high level snapshot obviously there's a lot of detail that sits underneath that but if you want me prepare a memo which better outlines the kind of the the trends and we have all that data really available so um and we can graph it up for you and would it show key areas where we're not meeting our target versus the ones that we are like yeah yeah we can certainly do that and it's not specific to a um some of it's locational so it's geographic as well so it's just but but anyway we can come back to you and then I guess related to that is what's the remedial plan like we're being overwhelmed with demand um are you seeking extra budget I know and furthering our report there's actually an underspend so you know again can we get a clear remedial action and cost if we want to catch up to the target or maybe we don't but we can provide you with an update on um what we've where we've been at in previous years and where we're at this year and how we intend to address it so it's not necessarily just a matter of chucking additional resources we can be more efficient in terms of how we do things um in terms of the road maintenance contract and and the underspending there that's that's a a separate issue to the one you're raising here which is around hybris tickets so I'd be happy to speak to that if you want me to or if that's another question all right thank you now I've got um jimmy and then mike jimmy first on page 24 regarding to the water supply I just don't know how to measure you know loss of percentage because in here you emphasize the urban waste residence supply those percentage 99.8 but h2 it's not a zero so I don't know because of work on the way we confirm those three secure ball criteria one you download 20 and 60 percent so I i don't know how to evade you at least one oh you're just one per perfect one country nine zero but you still have progress right I don't know and and also whether each criteria have any time frame or milestone to follow up so helen I might get you to come to the table to answer um that particular set of questions on uh page 24. thank you so and in short until we've met each of those three three criteria 100 we cannot get protozoal sign off so making progress doesn't doesn't mean you can you can have half sign off you've either completed or you or you haven't oh so that's a criteria but how about criteria too because you have under you know the criteria criteria there's several several temperaments below guang what's a target can fix it criteria two we have completed supply the city so the the other ones that we're doing um are the temporary below ground ones which can be raised up and some replacement wells so we're complete on criteria too and criterion three similarly we meet that within the city but until we complete criterion one complete that work to the satisfaction of the drinking water assessor we cannot get sign off okay okay thank you second question on page 31 31 is regarding the packs and the for sure the target is a hundred percent customer service request but actually it's a 66th percentage I just want to know regarding to the community parks the presentation a moment not yet down am I right when when this will be you know where villa happened I'm sorry I can't I can't speak to the parks csrs in any detail jimmy I'll have to work with andrew rutledge to come back to you with a reply on that okay thank you so can you come back to us on that one that'll be fine jimmy thank you mike thank you comment from a previous counsellor about a signalized pedestrian crossing on my north road so I just wonder if I could ask richard a question on on that to actually clarify thanks richard I guess the comment was that we've put in a crossing that stops buses that crossing is actually at the super stop where buses stop and it's there to allow the bus users to actually cross the road safely is that correct that's correct it provides legibility between incoming and outgoing buses thank you all right are there any further questions all right so I'm happy to um move what are now two resolutions in front of us to receive the information provided in the report and then to remove the level of service that we discussed earlier I'm happy to move those do I have a second or jimmy chen all those is there any debate on this all those in favor say aye against that's carried okay so then moving on to the next item item eight
Second all those in favor say aye against that's carried and now we move to item four which is the public forum um and I'd like to invite nick williams to the table nick thank you for joining us this morning um and under the um public forum you've got five minutes to address the committee thank you good morning chair mayor councillors everyone the reason why I'm here is we all know that canterbury multi-use stadium will be built and a great asset for the city will house a number of events throughout the year and what I am proposing is a tourist attraction which would be incorporated into the outside design of the stadium which will make the stadium a draw card outside of planned events now just to tell you a little bit more about what I'm proposing I have a licensing agreement with the swede and rotorua what I can do is show you a photo here of the sweep so essentially what it is is a dual mono rail track with suspended cycle pods traveling up to 50 kilometers an and pedaling it's mixture of manual and electric power over a 200 meter course it was opened in 2007 by john key in rotorua and has since had over 300 000 rides um currently it costs over 50 dollars to experience so 300 000 times 50 dollars is 1500 uh sorry 15 million in revenue and I actually think the same concept here in the heart of christchurch could do actually better because where it is in rotorua is located on the outskirts so boris johnson the current uk prime minister was proposing a concept similar to this called the fly outside the olympic stadium in london when he was the mayor of london in 2011. um so I also happen to have another licensing agreement with skyride technologies which have a prototype track in the in the us they have several products but I'd like um to add the sky chaser to the multi-use arena um so essentially what the sky chaser is is you are suspended in a harness and lie horizontally and have an electric throttle so essentially you ride like superman at over 50 would be more popular than the swede and would generate just as much in its own right so I'm actually proposing two monorail tracks uh one for the sweep and another for the sky chaser which would have a few dips and turns and allow for side to side movement for guest experience so this tourist attraction would be safe fun fast quiet cheaper than bungee jumping and competitive as you can race against each other and would be a major draw card now with all due respect to the tram and and punting on the avon which is sedentary these two attractions would be a little bit more high octane and get the blood pumping so to speak like if you take auckland for example they've got with the harbour bridge they've got a number of thrill-seeking attractions and as does the sky tower but christchurch doesn't have something like this close to the heart of the city so what I would like to propose is a cantilever system that it be adopted we buy steel beams jut out at regular intervals around the outside so that they would have adequate load-bearing capabilities so essentially two monorail tracks would be suspended off these steel beams with a sky chaser on top and the sweep underneath a star finished platform would need to be erected so that this could be positioned close to a toilet block and a possible cafe snack snack bar could be located in close proximity as well so if if the council were to give the green light what I would like to do is to speak to the stadium's structural engineer and architect to work out costs and in turn put forward a solid business plan uh together outlining all indicative costs because I feel this could be a great attraction for the city and potentially christchurch city council could have a financial stake in this thank you for your time and if there's any questions all right so you've left a very short time for questions james you've indicated already that you've got a question yes um kia ora nick and congratulations and where have you been all of our lives that's a great a rundown about my experiences thank you all right thank you look thanks very much indeed for the presentation and for um showing us those visuals this morning um and I mean yeah certainly your description of you know riding like superman is definitely very different than anything that you could do on the tram or the um or the punting um I mean your idea obviously is that this could be integrated with the build of a stadium um I think what we should do is refer this to our staff first of all to look at that suggestion but also to look at what other possibilities there might be for the kind of thing that you're talking about as well yes so um yeah we we have just given you the five minutes this morning but it's certainly something that we can refer to our staff um to see whether this is able to be integrated or added into you know maybe the stadium or maybe other things that are um possibilities that could happen in the future so thank you very much indeed for your just refer that to staff in that way there's no need for us to has a resolution to do so or anything yep that's great thank you all right so now moving on to item five deputations by appointment there are none presentation of petitions item six there are none
And all those in favor say aye and resolution to include the supplementary report um can I have a mover sam will move sarah will second all those in favor say aye against that's carried and now we move to item four which is the public forum um and I'd like to invite nick williams to the table nick thank you for joining us this morning and I'm
That's carried declarations of interest so we're noting a declaration of interest from the mayor and from myself in item 20 the christchurch foundation item three confirmation of previous minutes I'm happy to move those previous minutes sam will second all those in favor say aye and resolution to include the supplementary report um can I have a mover sam will move sarah was second all those in favor
That's carried declarations of interest so we're noting a declaration of interest from the mayor and from myself in item 20 the christchurch foundation item three confirmation of previous minutes I'm happy to move those previous minutes sam will second all those in favor say aye and resolution to include the supplementary report um can I have a mover sam will move sarah was second all those in favor
Fun before we have a quick 10-minute break happy to move so aaron's moving uh phil's seconding but we might have some questions so sam is there anything new to the paper we'll take it as read but is there anything new nothing to add no um tim yeah um in your the the information that's got at the very last paragraph of staff assessment is the comment um however the staff recommend does not support salary data is there a number of pre-existing organizations operating in central city that offer connectivity etc so um I'm just wondering how many other organizations in the central city are is this that new is this because also the total cost is almost 160 000 to operate it's a pretty big kind of operation it's you know yeah um so the first part of your question there's quite a few organizations uh let's name a few you've got tupuna kokori I know do funo auto navigators st john of god city mission even ministry of health have different navigating positions so what we community partners to say hey can you situate one of your navigators in this space rather than um applying or receiving grant funding to hire their own and your comment with regards to the cost of running this organization 160 000 to the cost is for the proposed project of hiring staff so currently it's run by volunteers so this isn't the the request budget isn't the cost of running organization necessarily it's the cost of hiring staff and the additional costs associated to that so do you what the the this operation is that they're applying for or the current operation as it stands now well it's a requested budget the total cost is 159 926 so you're saying that that's for the hiring of staff etc yeah that's for this proposed project to hire uh to actually have staff on the ground as social connectors yeah so as there are a number of other organizations doing this type of thing in the central city what is the total cost of this organization to operate yeah so the 150 000 applying for here is 40 000 for a position and 10. in terms of the breakdown of the total organizational cost we have their annual accounts um but I don't I don't know that off the top of my head so thanks mike thank you just a quick question obviously this is about building community and resilience through through food rescue when you talk about community um what community is this uh you'd be talking about your kind of at-risk high-need community that yeah sorry geographically though oh uh it's center east is where they're physically located so is there a reason why this didn't go to the community board um so we actually did meet with the local community board um staff when we met with carlos about this application um but it was deemed that people from all across the city come into the space to receive the the food and the social services they kind of tie in and so it came through to metropolitan based on the the people that access the services any further questions and so do we something that sits with the community board you know this is the reason why you know these larger community boards get a lot more more money so we have other instances around where we have something that geographically services one area that we're putting across the metropolitan fund yeah it's really common for it to be a bit of a balancing act um where you might have a service that's specifically located be it in the central city or in a board area but that attracts people from around the city it's very common and there's often a bit of a debate about where it's best to fit yeah thanks ann thanks it's um am I correct in reading that they have recognised that there are other groups working in the area and that they're going to be using the strengths of their administrative administration as well rather than create recreating their own is that what I'm reading here that's what we will be recommending to them yeah okay right that's good um and as a more general um uh like almost a map of the different networks in the city that are actually providing this kind of support for people so um I would suggest that the people that take advantage of this are from all over the place and they're just uh homeless not homeless uh needing food and so I'm wondering you know as a city it would be really useful to know where these different groups are operating so that we could give that information out to say well when we're discussing things like community safety and stuff like that is there yeah we know we know all of the the different food food banks that operate around the city the difference in this one being obviously it's cafe leftover food as opposed to donations from supermarkets um there's no registration um and it's only food for one day as opposed to a week or more so it hits a slightly different market but to answer your question we definitely know where all the food banks operate from great we'll be good to go um thank you oh ann's question about the administration so are they looking at are you encouraging them to use their administration to help others or to link in with others already established strong administration to link in with us stephanis we're looking we're suggesting this is a great project what they do and we're wanting to support it but we're not encouraging them to employ staff yeah partly because that adds a significant additional cost to an organisation and there are many and so we're saying working with others who already hire the social work type staff who have those connected relationships and can navigate people to services but they applied for some wages costs and 10 grand administrative costs for the organisation so let's support the admin to give them a boost so they can keep supporting their volunteers of which they have 126 but saying let's let's not support the hiring of staff but could our support or our cabinet also go into them say um being absorbed into one of the highly organized organizations to use what they're doing I to say right subsume yourself into another group that we don't have that level of influence with an independent not-for-profit thank you that's great any further questions no so we've got a mover and a secondary really um any debate tim you're not thank you or not a lot it's a great project that they're doing but we as a councillor just fund lots of different groups doing vaguely the same thing and in the previous um item I mentioned about almond virus schools which has almost kind of got left out because it's been doing so such a good job for so long and then we get all these new initiatives actually doing pretty much the same thing but they're new and we end up being a council that almost um funds organizations to expand then we kind of have to fund them again and again with more and more I I'm not going to support this because I think that we as a city should be really looking and encouraging these organizations to work together and have one head than a whole lot of different things because a lot of money at council and ratepayer money is spent on administration of a whole lot of organizations doing vaguely the same thing but with a slightly different attitude so I think we're at a moment in time in our city when we've got to start focusing and asking others to focus as well so I will not be supporting this thank you again um I um find myself in disagreement with my colleague um and and and but not not for a dissimilar reason that that he's just spoken um karis is as part of the free storm movement so it's established movement throughout new zealand uh and it had it set up on christchurch in 2018 and I only know this because I looked it up on the internet while we were discussing it um and the free store movement was founded in wellington in in 2010 so it's been around for a while they're a non-profit charitable organisation run 100 by volunteers and I actually think we need to give kudos to coffee cartel catnap cafe good habit habit green coffee and eatery grizzly baked goods hello sunday little bruise espresso luxe espresso mustache cookies raw sugar cafe southside social the great pastry shop totally gluten-free bakery under the red veranda underground coffee and west end stories and these cafes give them the leftover food at the end of the day so they're only open between 5 and 6 30 daily and they have a barbecue on a friday I think on a friday and as I say 100 volunteers I actually agree with council staff the recommendation to fund the admin it's just soul destroying when you're a 100 voluntary organization to get tied up with the admin but I also agree to discourage the employment of staff once you get into the employment of staff then you bring in health and safety you bring in acc obligations you bring in all sorts of there are so many different obligations that come with employment I do note that they are on grace vineyard's site and I'm I assume that they're not paying um the the been a a supplier who has um provided them with um a sorry a uh they've got a friends page so richard preston holmes has uh given them uh the fit out for their um for their shipping container um darren paddock has done all of their um designs and architectural work and grace vineyard has given them a home I just think they're doing all the right things and I'd like us to support them thank you pauline you look I agree with what my colleague leanne has just said too great example of collaboration that's what it's all about but this actually ties into the climate smart change strategy that we've just signed off for consultation in our program known towards zero waste um currently 157 000 tons of food waste per year across new zealand is dumped and I'd say most of this food would be waste if it wasn't collected by people like this doing this and it demonstrates my point in the last debate that yes there is a cost to climate change mitigation there is a this is just one example of a cost that we're willing to contribute to help this really good cause so I'll be I'll be supporting it today thank you anything further and yep concur I think we have to get better at actually networking and bringing these groups together so that we're not replicating costs that we keep replicating so I'm really keen if we could get some kind of as I said some kind of city map where we can see what people are doing who's working with who and how we can actually help to make that work more smoothly we have the city mission that we fund we we fund social workers in partnership with the city mission that do the job that they're describing here so it makes sense for them to be connecting with that and actually using that service that's already there that we we actually do fund partly and if there is a greater need then we need to look again at how we can resource that so um it's about working smarter and over the entire city so that we can do that so I would love if someone could get a map or maybe through smart view be able to identify where where places are so that we can give that information out to those who agencies particularly who would like to use them thank you um no one further okay I'll put that then all open favor please say aye any against got that recorded yeah okay so time against I declare that carried and we can take a quick break please be back here by 20 past 11 and we'll knock out the last couple of reports before the briefing
Get started then um so I'll ask anne to start us off the day please for this gathering we seek knowledge for understanding have purpose and all we do stand tall be strong and let us show respect for each other um so we now move to apologies we've got apologies for the meeting from councillor mcclellan um and councillor goff and the mayor for lateness oh yeah he's at the principal's breakfast all good um and councillor daniel's for lightness okay thank you okay do I have a movement close mel um and mike uh all in favor and against all right carrie thank you very much um any declarations of interest for today a few grand grant applications no that's good uh confirmation of previous minutes will confirm both the um public and private uh mpx minutes do I have a mover for those jimmy seconder second all in favor aye against note thank you very much there's no public forum for today and no deputations all right so now we move on to the ultitahi christchurch climate change strategy go you very much um and uh I think I'll just hand straight to you to introduce the paper and then I know that we've got some questions around the table great thank you um so christ church needs a comprehensive and long-term approach to address both the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change the strategy has been really designed as our blueprint for collective action to address those and very much working with our partners and stakeholders to achieve that we recognize that we can't do this alone and we need everybody on board so the strategy is designed as a long-term framework but we recognise this won't be the um the only climate change strategy it'll be something that we will continually uh update as we um as the science and as we sort of involve developing the programs together with the community so the strategy is designed around four goals to reduce emissions adapt to the challenges of climate change protect our natural environment and do that to ensure a just transition and there are 10 programs structured around supporting achievement evidence that climate change is top of mind for people and we surveyed the community about 18 months ago and had close to 3 000 respondents and they said that climate change was extremely important issue to them and recently again in the greater christchurch 2050 survey that came through very strongly around protecting the environment and as a key concern and focus for the community so in developing the strategy we've used the scientific evidence available we've incorporated a lot of the information from the regional climate change risk assessments and we've got data that looks at our emissions and that's all informed the development of the strategy in terms of engagement we've engaged both internally and externally so we've had a technical advisory group help us with developing the strategy with representation there from the universities youth groups like gen zero unions and community groups and business and we've also um in our sort of conversations um through the annual plan and when we set the admissions targets we got a lot of really good ideas and feedback that we've've also engaged with naitahu so we've talked to them in developing but most importantly how we're actually going to engage with them on an ongoing basis to develop the programs and we've had discussions with mkt and this has been used to develop a briefing paper to the sixth runanga and we've got a process in place to keep them informed as we develop the programs up so this really um sets out the direction and program of work and now is the opportunity to recommend our recommendations that we go out for public consultation and get the views of the community on the strategy and also to establish a working group really to guide the direction of our ongoing work thank you and can you just um just briefly explain how this aligns with the long-term plan of course yes so um climate change is very much a pillar of the long-term plan so we've uh through the development of that we've worked with the different groups across council through the activity plans to make sure that we're embedding um climate strategy will then complement and set up the framework for that ongoing engagement throughout the long-term plan and the actual um sort of decision-making process on the strategy and the long-term plan will be aligned yes so we're proposing to go out and consult in parallel with the long-term plan and so people can submit either through the on the strategy itself or ideas through the long-term plan and then we'll have hearings as part of the long-term plan to inform the final decision that's great thank you under questions from people so pauline yani jimmy thank you and thanks for the work on this the programs are they in any order of priority from one to ten or are they all in parallel does anything have priority over another uh they're not intended to be um I mean we would look to feedback on that um they're all really important so we haven't really set our mind to a prioritization uh we what will be really important is setting up the governance structure so sort of or the leadership and partnership so that early on so that's sort of laying the foundation for the way that we're going to work with the community but otherwise and they really span across sort of their adaptation and mitigation space so we haven't prioritised them yeah um you can I appreciate we've got adaptation mitigation but I'm just wondering if we've got enough focus on reduction and I think our main issue is in the transport and that's why artifice prioritised because maybe transport could be number one in the program and we could possibly work with our partners and look about how we can incentivize more use of different modes of transport and public transport uptake which would have the most direct benefit to us yeah I mean we certainly know that transport emission you know the transportation is a large component of our emissions so that will be something we need to tackle but we sort of weighed that up that equally the conversation around actually how we prepare and adapt to the changes from climate change you know how you balance that so it's on yeah we wanted to balance it with the planning but yeah we did have some debate about sort of how they were ordered right I mean if it's um helpful pauline uh conceptually uh what the approach has been is to uh the three stages effectively the first is the measure the second is to reduce and then the third is to offset end so we've got a very good understanding uh now through the measurement and we've already been doing some reducing but um that's where the next big opportunity is and in transportation to achieve a just transition you need to do actions in parallel some will deliver in the short term some will deliver in the medium and some in the long term but if you just focus on the short term ones um then you'll never start the medium and long term ones and there's often long lead in times particularly in the offsetting space for some of these activities so when we come to um sequestration um we need to have started so um that takes a long time space so we do need to do these in parallel not just focus on um we are the biggest emissions are because that might be different to where um the biggest reductions can be or equally where the biggest offset opportunities are right okay that's interesting and just quickly if I may on the on the waste we seem to focused on composting whereas maybe we need to mention you know that we have a direction towards anaerobic and so that we capture that carbon dioxide and reduce the methane as well so just wondering if we need to something in there about that and as our direction as well um yeah and um the other thing is that we talked about trees I mean what can we do to protect the trees that we have now with the residential intensifications we've got no ability to protect trees on private land have we and some of them are quite big ones and I know you talked about working into with different areas across council so I suppose it would be with a district plan but yes so um and also david griffiths to make sure that we are looking at the programs in light of the tree policy and the um you know the opportunities through the district plans yeah but it's how do we accelerate all that work because this is it's time dependentness and time is of the essence there is work going on at the moment on the urban uh forest plan on the christchurch bank experiencial urban forest plan to increase plantings across the city as well so that work will be coming through to you soon yep and just one final question if I may um so there is the budget attached to this at the moment is there anything or will that come through the consultation in the ltp so the initiatives are funded through the ltp across the various aspects so for example um the work that looking at electric the electrification of the fleet for our own fleet to look at meeting our own targets um the information provided by bruce rendell is that the proposed investment is 42 million over 10 years so that's an example consultation document we've got the other investment there in you know waste transportation yeah and the other parts of the um yes thank you thanks yanny there's lots of actions that are described but there's no budget or time frame so I'm just concerned that we keep adopting strategies without understanding the financial cost and impact on both the organization and and the community in terms of being able to pay for it so how do we get around that so that when we adopt something when we put it up for consultation a people can see how much we're going to spend on it but b when we improve it we can actually have confidence that it will happen because we did have a previous time um smart strategy and that I mean that's my second question is there's no analysis of why that one all the things in it didn't actually happen and I think until we understand that it's kind of hard to have confidence going forward so can we just split that into two so if we frames and budgets my understanding is that that's why we're aligning this with the ltp that's right so that the actual funding of initiatives is identified through the ltp so those are the examples like the investment in electrifying council's fleet and the investment in cycleways examples so the funding that we give out through the biodiversity fund and sustainability fund so there's those initiatives across the programmes of work and particularly in the transport space and three waters any what we want to do is get the feedback and ideas from the community and get some look at what some of those will be and some of those will require funding some of those will be more sort of engagement activities which we have some plans around and some budget for but until we really get the input only then will we actually have the detail uh around what some of that ongoing funding is and recognizing that it is going to take I mean there's urgency around it but it's also going to be a long-term approach and I think it climate change commission has grappled with in their draft advice for um the exact question like what's the cost to the country um of undertaking a just transition and over what time period um and that's both the what's it going to cost but what are the um what's the alternative of not investing and I'm sure councillors were conscious that the latest climate change commission advice is that the um cost is considerably less than what it was forecast to be just two years ago um but there's no it's in the billions of dollars at a national level um there's no easy way that we can see if what we're trying to achieve is to embed um future thinking about the impacts of climate change and do all of our work so every time we design a bridge we need to make sure that that bridge design allows for higher flood levels um or high rainfall or whatever it is every time we um do a stormwater swale that we do that um cognizant of the impacts of climate is a very large job and might not advance the actions that we now want to just sorry just to be really clear if we go to the draft strategy and look at the focus areas have have we quantified how much each of those will cost so that when the community says I like that priority focus area um and you know I support it or I'm concerned about that one is there a way that people can see how much we've got a budget I mean I have to say someone who cheered the draft water integrated strategy and still can't get progress on the reuse of um grey water and rainwater and are told that there's not the reasons to do it there's a whole bunch of things in here that kind of signal to me that actually they're going to struggle to get resourcing as well so that's why I'm really keen that when we agree to this that we can actually get progress on it rather than just adopt a whole bunch of things that sound good work well I think that the decisions that you make here um if you're committed to these decisions the challenge is to make sure that they flow through into the long-term plan so for example if you're committed to low emissions transport the investment that you make in active travel and cycleways in public transport infrastructure those are your decisions that you'll ultimately make through the ltp um I don't think it's prudent uh it wouldn't be prudent to preempt those decisions through um the allocation of a budget uh at a strategy level yeah the other thing to note is that the next step for council under each program has been included and budgeted for the focus areas themselves uh the way the the document is designed is to be a very long term approach working with the community to actually develop up specific actions so these focus areas are areas that we work with our partners with naitahu with other partner agencies and the community to develop up our actions on there so they won't all appear in the first one a very long approach that we need to take with the community um so it's not just one package that everything in this document will will um immediately occur it's it's almost like a framework for action for the future it's just you know that that's my concern because that's what we did in 2010 and we had very specific actions and we actually didn't see stuff happen so I don't want to repeat what happened then which is what I mean you know I'll keep raising yeah I think it's a really good point I think that the fact that we are going out for consultation on this and signing it off at the same time as the long term plan that we can be making those budget decisions yeah but can we get like a high level fine like because when I look at the cost of implementation it's just there's just so little information can we get at least something like an a4 or you know a few pages of here's the kind of team I think that um being able to put through maybe some links through to the stuff and the ltp that addresses the key projects might be really useful um but before we go into the next question and I've got a long list of people um the climate smart strategy yani mentioned as well could you just talk about because this isn't our first climate strategy no so the climate smart strategy was um one of the first climate strategies across the country so um in fact we came out early and um we've achieved a huge amount through that strategy and the fact that we're redoing a strategy now simply reflects that in the decades since the climate start climate smart strategy was implemented the science has changed fundamentally we didn't have the ipcc we didn't have emissions trajectories we don't didn't have the paris accord now trying to limit the temperature rise um and it simply reflects uh I think what um emu was saying before that um we'll redo this strategy in two or three years time understanding and our knowledge of um what trajectories globally were on what trajectories nationally run what trajectories at a city level were on will have changed uh over that time so I wouldn't um see the fact that we're redoing a strategy as a failure um actually we added we had achieved a huge amount through the climate change strategy and and I'm hopeful that we'll do the same thing through this strategy and the climate smart strategy was mostly focused on council as an organization yeah yeah so that's good okay I'm jimmy okay thank you I have two questions first one is regarding to the engagement and the consultation because I'm particular concern this one is focus on it's not only you know one way we just give the community the you know information proper information regarding to the lowest climate change how serious the other ones in response you know how to work together particular focus on those the action the program quite a few is in relation to the wider community one of our other community outcomes is cultures and ages but 80s maybe we consider all different ages political use children but all those cultures 25 percentage you know responding overseas how do we engage with them that's a big you know the kind of potential community can in response positively regarding to all implementation of this strategy what is your plan to engage with them so we think one of the advantages of going out with the ltp is that we can leverage um off some of the opportunities where we're having conversations on the ltp and also talk to communities and about the climate change strategy so we're working closely with katie and the engagement team and where there are those public events making sure that we're taking those opportunities um in the communities to talk to them about the climate change at the same time as the ltp so we can kind of leverage off the conversation that's happening around there so that's uh yeah that's an advantage okay but I just want to remind them because ethnic group they have quite a few uh media you they are big influence to the community second is I'm concerned our particular public transport you know transportation system because every day we are aware our neighboring council from sovereign detroit and from the wyoming they have the workers come to the quite church several thousands of times in cultures they will create you know this kind of the those carbon emissions but how do we to deal with this issue whether this strategy also invited them now have their say how to work together that's a very good question jimmy um I suppose uh what I deserve is um and uh sarah and I were talking about it right uh we're all global citizens so um the whether the issue is christchurch city district or whether the issue is uh greater christchurch with our relationship with uh salvador and um people will observe that um any things the things that we do actually you need to put in a national in a global context so um we're not going to have a fundamentally different co2 emissions or resulting temperature increases um in christchurch city that don't flow over nationally so this is a global ecosystem that we need to put ourselves in um the challenge with that though is not falling into the trap of thinking that you can't do anything because um it's a global challenge it's a global challenge with local solutions so um as the district and as individuals in christchurch city we need to be doing everything that we can to make a dent here we can't simply abdicate our responsibility as global citizens because other people aren't doing things that includes advocating strongly at both an official and a governance level um that our neighbouring tas um also um undertake their planning and their actions um including on those areas that you've talked about with the high level of single use occupancy vehicles traveling um from outlying districts into christchurch city for work we know that's one of the big challenges for the urban forum for christchurch um christchurch city has done some things to increase the density of our city and to provide alternative choices for people to live um but think that'll be the challenge that we face uh over the next few years um is how do we get those settings right about urban form um so that we don't have urban sprawl that contributes to um increased emissions through um private transport um but equally we get the balance between um uh density and amenity values of communities that people live in thank you thanks aaron yeah I've got a few but they're all pretty quick so um I'll just walk through them is there any cost benefit analysis on any of the programs we're doing just so it's measurable so you know dollar in dollar out or cents out or uh this is some question to what you asked yesterday um I've done a bit of research on your question from yesterday so um in general terms um the um depending on whether you measure emissions or whether you measure measure energy because cycling um consumes more energy um there's between uh five and twenty percent sorry between a five and twenty percent um less uh sorry um is a hundred percent um the emissions from uh cyclists are between five and twenty percent um of those tenants and missions so um uh you'd get somewhere between twenty twenty and five um cyclists uh for the same emissions is what a vehicle produces um it's not a exact science though in um so there's not a one for one kind of cost benefit uh that you would um create because cycling consumes more energy and depending on where you get that energy from if you're a meat eater for example then that probably negates the benefit of cycling um in terms of its emissions but it does have a whole range of other um well-being benefits as well so the answer to your question um is it varies and it depends and I'm I'm afraid there's not an exact um business case ratio that you can apply to this one of the big focuses of the transport plan which is under development is low emission transport and I will be doing a lot more analysis in terms of the cost benefit pause those as we look at the strategy for the work that we're planning to do um and the overall national stuff on cost benefit that a lot of that sort of stuff's being done though hasn't it so yeah so all of them because aaron's asking specifically for cost benefit work and are we able to point people in the direction of other cost benefit work on climate action that's been no we should show in all of like when we go to spend um you know a million dollars on a bus or on on anything we should be able to show the benefit cost wise is this and the carbon is this that mean that there should be pretty clear chances to make up yeah so I'm just gonna ask there is some work that can be done on sort of whole of life costs um and that is something that we need to get more sophisticated at and actually it's not just thinking about it in terms of economic costs but it's actually thinking about it within that of um cultural economic yeah and yeah and healthy so you can think about it in terms of economic costs but it is that cultural social and environmental that we also need to be weighing up uh and I think yeah yeah but we you we have to do that because it's not a bottomless pit of money and it's like do I build um say a bus stop here or do I give someone cancer drugs you've got to make a choice absolutely yeah and there is I think one of the things that's really important is that we um identify what are the things that we want to do locally and invest in and then what's the things that we can actually advocate to central government and that so you know our submission on the climate commission's um draft advice that's really important that we make that because some of those levers are going to be much better um give an effect to at the national level than they are locally so that the stuff we're doing locally is actually think this work that's being done through the coastal hazards adaptation program that stuff that's local and involves our community is actually where we're going to get real sort of value from and can I just check though you have included in the strategy in the background documents the costs of inaction so the estimated costs of the impacts of climate change we haven't_''_2735.76 um put that into the document but we can look for some links in there and the other thing to think is a lot of this is going to be on the it's like intended to be a digital and a lot of it on the website so it'll be um there but with a lot of supporting information and we want to drive people to the website so all this sort of information people can then go to that and see that there rather than kind of trying to embed that and answer that all within the information provider for people to look at absolutely yeah thanks aaron right yeah so um then the next one out at three what were the other two conceptually so hang on what was the first time measure measure reduce reduce offset right so then speaking globally and that's why you almost don't want to use the equation of if we do nothing because we're so small that you the needle wouldn't move at all you just couldn't even measure it on a global impact but and that's if we did everything if we just almost stopped moving you just wouldn't notice but that's globally speaking where we could have the most impact globally is by solving the problems not trying to uh just rearrange the deck chairs but putting our investment into uh the science that will fix the problems are we doing that aaron yeah is that something for our strategy would you like to see council investing in science well we do we do have partnerships with the university so that's the way we do and it is important so you know through our um work that we're doing with the deep south and we're contributing to that and contribute to that science which actually um is you know some of that contributes to the global science and actually we've got members you know in canterbury on um ipcc panel and we've um engaged with them so that's the way we're contributing our thinking to that kind of global effort the other one's monitoring the problem what are we contributing to the solution well we're just we're only looking at the actual strategy itself not everything just just the actual document for consultation is our focus for today christchurch has been one of the most inventive places in the world over history I think are there things that you'd like to see in the strategy that aren't there academic needle all that kind of stuff but we could solve this one yeah are there things in this strategy that aren't there that you would like to see there before it goes out of consultation well I just think we're a pretty smart city that we could be part of the solution rather than just monitoring the problem and's what brings us if you reduce the emissions the planet's still going to warm up that's why we're mitigating yeah we do have a program on um economic transformation and innovation to really highlight some of that stuff you're saying and working with christchurch and z and others to focus on some of the innovation and solutions behind it that was the answer I was looking for thank you yeah that's there right um and thank you kiara so um I was just reading through it's a page 42 somewhere around there sorry page 18 actually we have actually outlined some of the economic benefits for example the led lights saving a million dollars a year in electricity costs uh six hundred thousand dollars in maintenance I don't think we have to look far to see um economic benefit however this is a question um an extra 10 seconds in terms of um implementation implementation doesn't have to cost much either so I'm wondering um the climate change working group can you see their role as being involved you think uh we are um I mean we'll be looking for some direction um I think in a good example is the coastal hazards adaptation program the working group through that so it'll be identifying some sort of key areas of priority that we can work on and then actually coming up with I you know some of the initiatives that we want to put in place and doing that collectively uh we've had already discussions around doing some um focus on really the communication to underpin that behaviour change program and how we're going to engage with the community so I think that that is something that we can do together you know with other partners and actually one of the projects funded through the sustainability fund was a series of christchurch conversations around climate change so that's something we could see working closely with elected members on of engagement we know that our young people are leading the way here with with this um work and uh just wondering what you have in mind in terms of engagement with young people uh probably the expertise um but we have got a couple of members who are on our technical advisory group but katie's so we'll be working in with um ltp opportunities this is where I really hope to be able to capitalise on both of those things we've got a dedicated program for youth engagement as part of the ltp and hand in hand we'll be taking the climate change strategy because obviously as a core part of the ltp climate change is going to be of interest to them it follows that the climate change strategy will also be of interest to them and so we're just dovetailing them specifically have you identified groups within youth who will be targeted we're going to be guided by what youth council and committee tell us would be our best approach on that one we do have some stakeholders but obviously we'd like to ask our youth hardly like to be engaged thank you andrew thank you just want to focus on the consultation timeline so just noting previous comments about the need for this to and signing it off at the same time what are the actual proposed dates for the consultation the hearings and the final decision so the document goes out for consultation on the 12th yep march to the 24th of april so it's just about one week longer than the ltp yep um and then with a view to um doing all of the submission analysis ready for the hearings so that you have that information available and also have the information themed information from the ltp so it's all together as a package the hearings making can speak to with more authority but we're running them at the end of the hearings as I understand it so that you'll have the benefit of all the information um when you hear the submissions on the strategy so the end of the ltp so the hearings on this will be at the end of the ltp hearings that's the plan yeah um and then decision making on this strategy how does that align with decision making on the ltp hi um sorry I'll answer from here exact dates of all of those you know all the hearings we haven't exactly nailed down because it depends on how many people want to be heard but we're looking at having the ltp hearings and then the climate change ones kind of at the end of that period and then I'm looking at dates um based on what I'm hearing now I'm thinking of aiming for the three june council meeting for the climate change strategy to hopefully feed in in time for the ltp on the 23rd of june I think all right so the intention is that the decision on climate change strategy will be made before the decision on ltp that's exactly what I'm driving at and then a second question which I'm pleased to hear that and a second question um which is related um people are likely to submit to the ltp on matters that relate to um climate change and are relevant for consideration for this strategy how are we going to handle the inevitable subject crossover between the concurrent um consultation hearings processes so it's going to be quite difficult to to um yeah to get people to separate the two because you know a person might want to put in a submission that crosses boundaries so because full council will be the hearings panel for the climate change strategy you will all get all the information for from both and it might be a little bit of you know trying to move people sideways perhaps but it will really depend on what they have to say and availability as well but I'm hoping that it will be just a matter of you know you've received all the submissions all of you know full council and heard all the the hearings for both and then there'll be an analysis that hopefully will tie some of those things together for the um for the climate change strategy decision making as well great thank you melanie um just on there because you've just brought it up would it be possible to if someone submits on the um on the long term plan about that could we then ask them if um climate change one if they haven't realised yeah they would actually just direct them to do it I think so I think what if it's if it's just one single item that they've submitted on for the ltp and it's clearly for the climate change strategy I think what we'll do is go back to them and die and and get them to look at the strategy in case they haven't seen it and just ask if they want us to pick it up and put it over which would be the easiest thing for them to do I think my actual question um was um about you talked about engaging with the community um have you thought about um the role of community boards because like there's a few programs in there um that I could see community boards could be probably um quite useful for and the reason I actually noticed is because for program 10 the sustainable food one of the things we should add I haven't_''_3366.88 picked up before is about the edible and sustainable awards that before that goes out so they don't say we've missed it yeah so if we can add that into one of the bullet points that would be good but yeah what have you thought about that um we've sort of had some conversations with community boards but it is an area that we need to do some more consultations so through this um we'll look at how we can make sure that we're engaging with them um because it has been quite informal to date but also like involving them like we had someone come to the board about getting people to cycle and having competition absolutely you know and so there's lots of stuff like that that can be done that's really local yeah and I know when we went out um for public consultation we went out for consultation on setting a target and the community boards came along and you know spoke to sort of particular areas of how they wanted you know we could be involved so yeah we'll we'll do some work with that cool right for questions is there anyone else no okay any questions on the working group so we've got a list of names up on the screen at the moment sam yeah yeah thanks very much and I flipped through some questions the other day which is brilliant we got essentially everything back except for that one on the parts and the mowing yes around the ecology systems did we get an answer on whether um that the ecowork system will affect the how we maintain our parks and the like I don't have a answer back from parks on that I don't yeah so I just checked brendan would that come under levels of service and stuff rather than yes I'm just trying to record uh if um you're concerned that we would stop mowing parks um uh then that's not the case we've kept the levels of service through the ltp through the draft ltp uh for mowing so we're not proposing anything radical like stopping mowing to let the grass grow free and wild cool it might be sam you may there's a group a community we just wanted to double check no no yeah there's a community group in austin who have who've said that they don't want any spraying and so they've taken over the maintenance of a park yeah no no I just that was my only thing so that's fine I think that's all good okay anything further from anyone well thank you very much thanks for the presentation and um we'll move to the motion I'm happy to move like second do we have any debate yep yanni didn't jimmy then anne just um wanting to get a resolution that we do get some financial information about the time frames so you know I think it's important that we record that so financial and so it's an amendment here's the previous one we had really clear simple easy to understand actions and costs and timing and I'm just really concerned that we've got none of that for this and we're asking people to give feedback so you know I like to try and get some information but so yeah in what way would that be different to the budgets and time frames set out in the long term plan well it may be just that if staff have got that information then can they just put it into the draft strategy or attach it as an appendage so people can see that'd be great yeah that would be really helpful so it's a proposed amendment just to put some words in there so can I just check um katie when it comes to the engagement over this is it possible to put links through um two different parts of the ltp with some of the budget lines and things in it or pointing people make best efforts to point people towards um areas uh that that correlate absolutely and the new ltp tool should make things an awful lot easier in that regard as well so um to be able to interrogate the um the database that you've now seen so um yes um I believe we should be able to link um some information across so we've done a strategy to actually having budget information at the same time for the different streams so do you need a resolution to be able to that says can you do that or can you just do that um we can just do that yeah if that's useful in terms of the operational costs that can't_''_3641.04 be shown with the nutella cannon this is a very high level it's it's there's a massive operational cost to do the things in here that we say we're going to do and let's be clear about it we are really good at adopting strategies and then going oh what happened what's your wording so we're going to meet professionals request staff to provide the proposed operational costs associated with the actions okay so can I just have some advice from staff on that because my my reading of your faces is um well I feel as though we've answered that question when it was asked but obviously council's prerogative if you were to accept the amendment um the how that is a good work and is helping um climate preparedness from um the other work that a park ranger does so I think maybe the best approach would be to use some examples in linking um through to examples but I think um it would be a very challenging task to arrive at the final number of everything across the 500 million dollars that we spend in opex and 600 in capex per year um to which is climate change related and which isn't so yanni can you give me a specific example of something in the strategy where you should like the costs provide climate education schools and promote youth voices and leadership there will be a cost to that it might be thirty thousand dollars it might be fifty we could link to their enviro schools line in the um okay so and there's a number of it goes on and on there's a number of those things work with communities on banks minutes to develop responses to localized climate issues such as threats to water supply increased wildfire risk and erosion one of was communities coming along saying how come we can't_''_3767.359 do this now and the response was well we don't have the resource so again so just let's just remember that this isn't quite your debate yet you're just looking at no no but in terms of just getting the information back you know there's a lot of specifics in here that either have work programs attached or don't and that's the thing that I don't quite understand is what the cost is and I think if people for asking people about submissions on what we do then people should some sense of what the budget implication is so in what way are we able to do that at this short notice given that we have had two workshops already and you know it's a lot of work for staff to be doing at a very last minute just ahead of something going up for consultation you can clarify yeah is it to do with yanI's point yeah because mine is a understand and get where you're coming from message from the council laws that we're sitting in ltp and it has a budget maximum so therefore anything that would add money to any project would have to take and cannibalize from somewhere else in the organization so I get totally what you're saying but we need I think I want to hear from the community what they feel and what they see the priorities are for climate change anything over and exceeds already established budgets is for the ce and her team to cannibalize something else because we have we're going to set a target so I think we're kind of in part it would have good to have that information you're asking for yani but the card is before the horse in a wee way hang on hang on a second you've made your point really really clearly we're just trying to clarify what we can do here yeah uh leanne my question is and it's really in relation to yanI's is that does it have to be put in the document at the front end wouldn't has been prepared and then um at the at the um at the point that we're signing off on it which is the lead up to the ltp we can actually identify what the what the specific actions are arising and the costs associated with them so that they are built into the ltp I i can't see it going any other way but you can you could just simply note that staff will provide um the operational costs along with the agreed actions at the appropriate time so it just seems to me that that would be a far more reasonable way that makes sense and and people will be able to look at the um the costs and the ltp for a range of different projects as well especially the capital projects but um linking through to the enviro schools line those kind of things as well the adaptation planning that working with the communities would be really good so we're looking at some amendments so we have a note here do you need that as a formal amendment in the resolutions yanni as long a knight wouldn't_:_3954.319 I just and sorry for not raising it earlier but when I got point seven of this report the resource implications I was shocked at the fact that there's very little information I would have thought you know we didn't have this in the workshops but this would have been so there are things let's just remember that there are things that are within the strategy that are current work programs that won't be changed by the strategy particularly so the work that we're doing on the cycleways program isn't driven by the climate change strategy it happens to be part of the climate change work we're doing but it's not driven by the strategy so it'll be difficult to pull out what is strategy costs and what is just normal council work um so do we have any more clarifications before we move into debate because I do have a debate list and I just wanted to clarify I know we've moved on from questions to staff but in terms I think what yani is that we are going to be doing all this work and starting it all and I think maybe the wording could be changed so that we're actually strengthening what's already happening rather than creating new stuff uh it's not intended uh depends on what you describe as we um we as uh everyone is what we're trying to encompass in this uh strategy there is work for council to do there is work for business to do there's work for citizens to do there's work for communities to do there's work for us to do as a country and as a planet so um I think it's important to recognize that this isn't um that onus or the responsibility for climate change cannot be solved by council and so intentionally um it's a mix of activities there some are council led some uh where we might um agitate to government some are eat less red meat and cycle more yeah I was just alluding to what yani was saying about providing education I mean there are lots of things already we're actually going to build on that utilize it recognize it and strengthen it absolutely so that's not going to take any budget from us okay so let's let's get back because we have had a moved and seconded um we've had some clarification we have a note mike you're happy to add the note there I am too so that's all good so we have a debate list and at the moment it goes yani jimmy and andrew that was the only point so basically I just wanted to try and get as much information to the community when we seek their feedback so they can see what we're proposing understand the cost um and the time frame and so appreciate you've made a sort of note which is probably the best that we can get I do think actually as a council we need to think about all the strategies that we adopt and how we actually make sure that what we say we're going to do gets done because I do think we run the risk of or capacity to deliver in the time frames if you go back to the original climate smart strategy there were a number of really good actions and what's striking about that one and this one is how much similarity there is between the two it's almost like we've just kind of copied what we did in 2010 but we didn't deliver on and so I think there's some really good stuff in here um and let's get it out to the community to get their feedback but let's be really clear if we want to take action in terms of climate change it's going to cost us to do a number of actions that are in here and I personally do think it's important that we signal that to the community so that we can get the appropriate feedback about where the priorities should be thank you jimmy thank you yeah I think uh some of our counselors and mayor we probably remember you know back to the in may of a 2019 council actually adopted and declared formally the otahi city we are my age respect to the uh 15th or march the same day you know most attack the same day I was one of councillor we was in the casino square so many young people from so many communities teenagers requests requesting a big voice to save for all the the planet you know and also they make submission in the council table reputation we also it's good image even today we are so I'm very happy you know today even a little bit late for almost the morning one and a half the the years but at least this draft strategy can come out and today we will adopt as the draft one put on the public the consultation we need to recognize this quite a serious biggest challenge in our time because affect so many the not only the economic environment social culture violence is a big impact so how to in response you know quickly try to serious and integrate working together this that's most important but I i think a moment today we uh the adopt this one put a public direction framework you know the heavy voice we value every voice every the repair every resistance we need to be the humble to listen to them particularly this issue is in relation to the everyone and also our next generation so how to improve those engagement improve those consultation that's very very crucial we need to you know do our best to make the happen the other ones are agree with yani because I review all those the 10 the asian program actually let's actually plan actually that's true because the staff is the answer the error concept aaron the the question make sure reduce actually important but today maybe in the next stage you know after the the consultation we need to you know step is more detailed action plan implementation plan we set up time frame measurement who is the leading the agency who is the support in the agency digitally then we know which year which the items council need to put in our long term plan which one some other agency that's their responsibility more clearly then we can implement this kind view thank you thanks jimmy um anne so we all know and love david attenborough and he one of his quotes is that many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies in our economy economics and in our politics and I think that here with council leading the way with this draft strategy I think we are putting our money where our mouth is and doing that so one of the many strengths I think of the strategy is that it acknowledges what we're already doing within council and connects those things it also stands very strongly on the shoulders of council strategic priority of meeting the challenge of climate change through every means available so I'm proud of this the work and thank you for it and I think also of our leadership in this I look forward to strong engagement with our communities and they're going to give us feedback about what we can specifically do here and then the working group I can see can take those suggestions those thoughts on saying there's no point in having a strategy if we don't have action so I'm sure that this this will lead this process this great engagement that katie's team will leave will actually bring about that action so very supportive thank you um andrew thank you I'm also um supportive of this um there are a number of key points that the strategy in my view highlights quite well um we can't do this alone we need to do it in partnership this requires collective action so every individual every household every organization has got a part to play not just the council this requires a multifaceted approach so no single action will make the change on its own but the contribution from a number and variety of actions certainly will so in view of the recent draft advice from the climate commission which is also currently open for consultation this is very timely in fact it's time some would say past time I'm pleased that we're consulting on this draft alongside the ltp I think that'll help draw attention is one of the most significant and important consultations that we'll carry out and I expect the community will have views I hope they do and I encourage individuals and organizations to make submissions on the draft strategy I want people to be telling us whether they think this is ambitious enough whether we're challenging ourselves enough whether we're actually doing everything we can whether we're really giving effect to our declaration of a climate and ecological emergency I'm keen to know the community's views on what the quick wins might be what the priorities might be and I'm also pleased that it'll be the whole council hearing submissions I think that shows just how important this is to us coming back to yanI's point strategy development's important engaging with the community's importance but it's actually taking the action that delivers meaningful outcomes that's the most important thing here so development and funding of the climate action programs will be essential to this strategy working and I welcome moving quickly to funding or linking to where funding from this strategy and in that regard I'm pleased that we'll be making decisions on this strategy before we finalize the long-term plan as we know time isn't on our side here and some of this action is well overdue thank you melanie um dr um rod car the chair of the climate change commissions um was saying the other week that um new zealand's got 0.06 of the population of the world but currently our emissions are 0.17 so that's means that new zealand makes about three times as much emissions per person than the average nation so actually it's important that we as a country are doing something in that and that christchurch is making this step I think is um important so um you know it's about looking to the future and our 2030 and 2045 um goals with the net zero emissions um and and again I'm behind the strategy um but I do think when this consultation happens I think the specifics will be very important and I think we'll see from our submitters that they want us to do and probably say there's not enough in this strategy they want to see that because that's what we saw with the waste minimisation plan they really wanted the action plan to be quite clear um and of course that's that's going to be that well that's part of the terms of reference for the climate change working groups I think that we need to take it really seriously when we hear all these things from the people to make sure that we are adding there to the implementation of action plan and that we keep going out to people to check in with them quite regularly about that um and you know it's the small things I just realized I'm I need to get myself a better cup um I'm terrible with that but there are um you know there's all the small things that we can do and like for our board with the edible and sustainable garden awards we've got 54 entries this year our highest number and I did very little to try two people so um people care um so good on us for doing this and there's hope that we get lots of good information back from everybody thank you pauline thank you thanks for the work on this and we did hear the the expression along this is a long term program but we don't want it to be too long term so we need it to be as short a term as we can but this is a real test for our council for our enabling abilities that we have we've got to really really rely on technology and innovation and we have to embrace change we've got to develop our programs with the community we've got to step up and we must ensure that this runs right through our organization every department but particularly procurement I believe we want to see that waiting in the procurement it needs to be there for instance with our waste our focus should be on energy rather than compost in my view and we want to ensure strong waiting on carbon reduction and I'm just reading he quotes a green premium so that's the additional cost of buying green technology because there is a cost for instance an electric car is a lot dearer than buying another one or free buses if we wanted to fund free buses there's a cost to that so we will need budget we may need serious budget and we'll need our partners so I'll be supporting this today and look forward to the feedback from people cheers thank you tim um thank you um I think it's a really good idea running alongside ltp we don't have a choice obviously but I think it's going to raise its profile with many of the people that may not have actually wanted or bothered to come out and comment on it I think it's absolutely essential that all of our residents do interestingly though I follow on from what council johansen was going on about we do have to be sensed with the costs and the ongoing operational costs of implementing the strategy it is so important we've got to have a really I think to have um give it depth and the value that we see and been talking about it around this table and also nationally and globally we have to have a really good idea of that to give it substance to go forward and as a responsible council trying to keep rates to a minimum we also have to look at if it's going to be above what is expected within our operational capital then we've got to look at where we're going to take it from within our budgets and that is only good good management I think enviro schools was mentioned in the debates and also innovation etc some of the groups that have been doing this for a long time and getting really good results like environmental and virus schools were almost kind of pushed aside with these new initiatives that came to us which actually aren't new initiatives some people like and virus schools and others have been doing this for a long time so I think that we've got to wake up as councillors and really look at what what we're funding and supporting those that are actually really getting good mileage and I'll be certainly looking at that because um you know we we've only got a certain amount of dollars and we've got to get traction for it and we've got to be responsible going forward so thank you thanks tim anyone else yeah yeah um I welcome this going out for consultation and I hope we actually get robust debate not the usual same old same old telling us that things they've been telling us for the last few years uh because there's so much um to to this debate um certainly uh man's impact on the environment has been massive for quite some time the climate has always changed always will change and when you look back over the last 100 years it's 1965 was the last time that a natural disaster in a natural disaster is drought floods extreme weather extreme temperature landslides dry mass movements wildfires volcanic activity and earthquakes but the last time more than a million people was killed was 1965. it was more than once every decade was there more than a million people killed from natural disasters they've always been around what the change was in the 20th century was moving people out of poverty because taking people out of poverty is one of the big key changes to climate change I think new zealand can have a massive influence on uh global climate change by being a smart leader and coming up with a number of the solutions that will help the world whilst I agree with melanie on the home gardens I have an edible landscape myself with over 30 fruit trees home gardening is not always as good as people think it is because often people drive down to the garden centre to buy two plant two planets of seedlings the carbon footprint of that versus a farmer who mass farmer who mass farms the same vegetables is far far lower and any domestic household that does gardening their chemical usage per square meter is far higher than farmers so unless they're farming organic at home and so if you're 100 organic and you and all that you've got a low footprint but if you drive down to the garden center and buy yourself two punnets of seedlings to save the planet you haven't_''_5027.6 um so I look forward to the debate um I'd like to see a lot more cost go into um some of the stuff we do because having a whole lot of 40-seater buses driving around the city with five and a half people on them per average won't save the planet it'll look good especially for all the same color a few people won't even see them but that way we'll feel like we're saving the planet but you're not actually saving the planet we need to be smart about what is the next form of energy uh what is uh what is the future of energy and I look forward to that because we need to be putting a lot of investment into smart green technology that makes economic sense you can't just heavily subsidize something to make yourself feel good you've actually got to make it the world and I can hear murmurings from the side but when you go to band gas barbecues to save the planet you might want to just check the emissions level from that because what are you going to cook on now you're going to go back to charcoal so yeah you might want to just check what sometimes the unintended consequences can be so I look forward to a cleaner greener christchurch and I look forward to the debate that will fuel our steps forward because I hope it's a bit more robust than it's been thank you anyone else no nick oh okay extremely important conversation with the people of christchurch administer his presentation that's not words that we need to do it's actually action and we know that climate change is the biggest intergenerational challenge that we face and states quality is no longer good enough than we intervention works inaction will cost this council our communities and our city so much more than simply doing what is right both the environment and the people most importantly now does not need to just approved to consult on and through our long-term plan it's about prioritizing what gives us the most benefit and I hope between this consultation and the long-term bankruptcies and our communities will give us a strong mandate okay no no I'll turn my mic on but I won't start again decades of under investment in public and active transport have created a car culture in our city that has led to high car ownership and a land transport system that contributes 36 percent of our district's greenhouse gas emissions at the draft long-term plan meeting yesterday there were councillors who voted against the proposed rate increase calling out the spend on public transport and cycling I do wonder if they actually read the transport program because only 6.6 of the total transport spent is going towards public transport and 16.3 towards cycling it is this car is king attitude that has put us in the position that we face today when we focus on walking cycling and public transport not only do we help reduce emissions we help improve health and well-being connect communities and into two important consultations for this city my question to the people of christchurch are we doing enough do you want true climate action do you want true environmental action and do you want true social action mike it would be nice if you mentioned the economy there once as well sam sorry you haven't debated so if you'd like to debate climate change is here and it's ramping up it is not a challenge for some theoretical future generations it's current generations we sit here in an air-conditioned building while outside fire crews are on high alert again and it's not just about costs it's about opportunities there is often concern expressed that mitigating the impacts of climate change by reducing emissions will cost councils and ratepayers millions and they will and we need to be clear about that but equally certain is that without action now the cost will be much higher and the longer we delay responding the higher the cost will be local government new zealand released research last year which shows that councils across new zealand face 5 to in the next 50 years these are only council infrastructure costs pipes roads and facilities and don't include any potential adaptation or protection measures however not only will infrastructure be exposed but so will economic development and growth community health and safety and social support systems in christchurch we carry a lot of this at current emission rates we may be facing a one metre sea level rise by 2100 this would put 300 kilometers of our roads and a thousand kilometers of three waters pipes at risk there are up to 25 000 homes and businesses at risk these are our communities and it's valued at current rates at 6.7 billion dollars we need to act now to try and stop this from being as bad as it could be and the ensuing social costs of relocating families and communities those are the human costs but as we're already seeing a natural environment is impacted too native species like the kakariki karaka are sensitive to temperature change and many to changes in habitat due to floods droughts or new pest species we know how quickly the views from the port hills within days were crystal clear across to the southern alps people had more livable communities traffic noise was down people were out on their streets walking and connecting with each other and clients so climate change offers not only these challenges but they're mitigating it offers opportunities to reshape the way we live and how we do business to improve outcomes for all a greener more livable city with great sustainable transport options and local amenities benefits us all and that's why transition is important and not a sudden change like covert was making staged investments and behaviour changes will enable us to meet our targets together and not leave anyone behind there will always be those who find excuses not to act on climate change who don't see it as a priority right now or who have no vision for the future but an action in action will cost us as a council it is already costing our communities now and it will cost future generations if we choose not to act the reality is what we do has an impact from a negative impact to a positive one let's become the 21st century sustainable garden city that residents told us they wanted back in 2011 and let's do it together and with that I'll put the motions to the vote all those in favor say aye any against no past unanimously thank you very much right now we move to item eight the christchurch support for mayor's joint statement on accelerating climate change climate adaptation in cities and lien if you'd like to do this one for us I apologize this is a report on uh an invitation that I received to participate in the 1000 cities adapt now global program uh which was which I assessed to be in line with um actually all of the things that we've just been debating the joint statement which I signed up to on our behalf looks at the shared principles that drive cities climate adaptation actions so in many respects I mean I didn't participate in the debate on the last item because I knew I would be uh discussing it here but in change I i wish we were talking about climate um resilience and and action and in the same sort of breath because climate change is is kind of passive it's it's it's what's happening you know climate is changing but our response to it has got to be about building resilience and that fits very much in the resilient cities network that we have been a part of uh since um 2013 and uh and essentially the um the work that's been done in a number of areas that have focused on the need for cities to take action so uh so I've just presented it to you um and so all the resolution asks is that we receive the report and that we note our role in progressing the 1000 cities adapt now global program and as I said it ties in with the work that we're doing it also ties in and I did speak about two things in particular I mean christchurch is a very small city compared to the other cities that were involved in the and the um or the mayor's forum and uh I spoke about our engagement um with manafenua and and how significant the role of our local ewe in terms of climate change adaptation was and that the fact that they had taken a leadership role within their own rohi and I also spoke about the significance of the work that we were doing with our local communities in terms of coastal hazards and the preparation work that's going on the investment and what 23 communities around the climate change adaptation planning often people wonder what the value is around international networks and I just want to mention one thing that's happening next tuesday and it is as a direct result of our engagement in this network and and that is um we have uh hank ovink who is the special envoy for international water affairs for the kingdom of the netherlands um who as people might know was involved in the hurricane sandy rebuilding task force is the principle of rebuild by design the author of too big which I have a copy of in my office if anyone wants transformative response to climate change arising out of the the hurricane sandy rebuild that the connections between the netherlands and and and our own little city of christchurch on the other side of the world is significant his knowledge around water flood risk management water governance building um with nature and living with water they're all incredibly relevant relevant to this work on adapting now um and it's also relevant to the work that we need to be doing around a number of things surrounding water governance and all of the issues that we're having to confront in that area so uh I'm just um the report really speaks for itself and I'm just simply asking that you note um our role I've not uh committed us to any sort of financial undertakings of just looking around the table I've simply said that these are important issues for us and that accelerating and scaling climate adaptation actions in a thousand cities around the world by 2030 is a very good objective and one that we want to support thanks leanne_``_5747.119 I first came last year and the british high commissioner at that point was encouraging cities to join so it's been really good do you have any questions for them jimmy 1000 cities still going on by 2030 1000 cities um that people are being yeah people are cities are being invited to already yeah okay okay no being invited to join okay so now yes they're going on by they're gathering up a second thanks yeah the um under the joint statement is founded on five shared principles that will drive the climate adaption focusing on equity in the vulnerable and poor communities and adaption of climate resilient actions what does that mean uh in terms of ensuring that there is uh equity I think what it identifies is that around the world a lot of particularly vulnerable communities in terms of impoverished communities live in low lying land areas alongside rivers or close to the coastline and they are particularly impacted by climate change and sea level rise and of course other disasters as well when I spoke to um the former head of the un development program she said that uh all of the work that they do in terms of undp investment is actually investment in resilience and is it because there is no point building back the way things were and re-exposing people to the vulnerabilities that they were exposed to that caused the problem in the first place it's actually about building resilience to future events at the same time and that's been their model of investment for a very long time so is it about lifting them out of poverty or just adjusting the environment around them no it's about being um well lifting them out of poverty I mean I heard what you said before in the climate change uh paper um it is true that people that are in uh you know who are poverty-stricken find themselves in uh and in more challenging situations but but it it it does mean that people need to be um it does mean that cities that have vulnerable and poor communities that are that are living in environments that are particularly vulnerable then they need to that their situation needs to don't think that these apply equally in every every city setting right but there will be some cities that have extremely vulnerable communities alongside rivers um and if you look at the impact of drought if you think of what of how many millions of people for example are dependent on the ganges and you you apply a drought scenario or flood scenario to either I mean any part of that population you're talking major um major uh uh trauma being imposed on on communities so it's just it it's looking at whether communities themselves are in the position to adapt and and and you'll notice that advocating for local leadership and empowerment and funding to gain leverage and scalable action the government has already said that it is going to have to participate here in new zealand around some of the most vulnerable communities to sea level rise around the country and there are people that are very wealthy in those communities and there are people that are not so wealthy in those communities all around new zealand so it's just about finding in that case um I'm happy to move it happy to move it and pauline seconded any debate no in that case I'll put the motion all in favor please say aye aye any against no it's carried thank you very much thank you um so I think we'll do one more the metropolitan discretionary response fund before we have a quick 10-minute break happy to move so aaron's moving feels sickening but we um might have some questions so sam is there anything new to the paper we'll take it as read but is there anything new nothing to add no um tim yeah I'm in your the the information that's got at the very last paragraph of staff assessment is the comment um however the staff recommend does not support salary today is there a pr a number of pre-existing organizations operating in the central city that often connected in etc so um I'm just wondering how many other organizations in the central city uh is this that new is this because also the total cost is almost 160 operation it's you know yeah um so the first part of your question there's quite a few organizations uh let's name a few you've got tupuna kokori I know do whanau order navigators st john of god city mission even ministry of health have different navigating positions so what we're talking about is really just reaching out to the community partners to say hey can you situate one of your navigators in this space rather than um applying or receiving grant funding to hire their own okay and and your comment with regards to the cost of running this organization 160 thousand dollars to the cost is for the the proposed project of hiring staff so currently it's run by volunteers so this isn't the the request budget isn't the cost of running organization necessarily it's the it's the cost of hiring staff and the additional costs associated to that so do you understand what I'm what I mean yeah so what are do you know what the the cost of this operation is that this is what they now well it's a requested budget the total cost is 159 926 so you're saying that that's for the hiring of staff etc yeah that's for this proposed project to hire um to actually have staff on the ground as social connectors yeah so as there are a number of other organizations doing this type of thing in the central city what is the total cost of this organization to operate yeah so the 150 000 is the total cost of kairos uh what they're applying for here is 40 000 for a position and 10. in terms of the breakdown of the total organizational cost we have their annual accounts um but I don't I don't know that off the top of my head so thanks mike thank you just a quick question obviously this is about building community and resilience through through food rescue when you talk about community um what community is this uh you'd be talking about your kind of at-risk high-need community that yeah sorry geographically though oh uh it's center east is where they're't go to the community board yes um so we actually did meet with the local community board staff when we met with carlos about this application but it was deemed that people from all across the city come into the space to receive the the food and the social services they kind of tie in and so it came through to metropolitan based on the the people that access the services any further questions and so do we have because to me it sounds like it should be something that sits with the community board you know this is the reason why you know these larger community boards get a lot more more money so you know we have other instances around where we have something that geographically services one area that we're putting it across the metropolitan fund yeah it's really common for it to be a bit of a balancing act um where you might have a service that's specifically located be it in the central city or in a board area but it attracts people from around the city it's very common where it's best to fit thanks ann thanks it's um am I correct in reading that they have recognised that there are other groups working in the area and that they're going to be using the strengths of their administrative administration as well rather than create recreating their own is that what I'm reading here that's what we will be recommending to them yeah okay right that's good um and as a more general um question is there any way that we can get a uh like almost a map of the different networks in the city that are actually providing this kind of support for people so um I would suggest that the people that take advantage of this are from all over the place and they're just uh homeless not homeless uh needing food um and so I'm wondering you know as a city it would be really useful to know where these different groups are operating so that we could give that information out to say well when we're discussing things like community safety and stuff like that the different food food banks that operate around the city the difference in this one being obviously it's cafe leftover food as opposed to donations from supermarkets there's no registration um and it's only food for one day as opposed to a week or more so it hits a slightly different market but to answer your question we definitely know where all the food banks operate from great we'll be good to go um thank you sorry question yeah um you just mentioned before and it's colin from ann's question about the administration so are they looking at are you encouraging them to use their administration to help others or to link in with others already established strong administration to link in with us stephanis we're looking we're suggesting this is a great project what they do and we're wanting to support it but we're not encouraging them to employ staff yeah partly because that adds a significant additional cost to an organisation and there are many and so we're saying working with others who already hire the social navigate people to services but they applied for some wages costs and 10 grand administrative costs for the organisation so let's support the admin to give them a boost so they can keep supporting their volunteers of which they have 126. 26 but so let's let's not support the hiring of staff but could our support or our cabinet also go into them say um being absorbed into one of the highly organized organizations to use what they're doing I think that might be beyond our scope with an organisation to say right subsume yourself into another group that we don't have that level of influence with an independent not-for-profit thank you that's great any further questions no so we've got a mover and a secondary really um uh any debate tim you're not thank you or not like it's a great project that they're doing but we as a council just fund lots of different groups doing vaguely the same thing and in the previous um um item I mentioned about um virus schools which was almost kind of a good job for so long and then we get all these new initiatives actually doing pretty much the same thing but they're new and we end up being a council that almost funds organizations to expand them you kind of have to fund them again and again with more and more I'm not going to support this because I think that we as a city should be really looking and encouraging these organizations to work together and have one head doing a whole lot of things like an octopus rather than a whole lot of different things because a lot of money council and ratepay money is spent on administration of a whole lot of organizations doing vaguely the same thing but with a slightly different attitude so I think we're at a moment in time in our city when we've got to start focusing and asking others to focus as well so I will not be supporting this thank you again um I find myself in disagreement with my colleague um and and and but not not for a dissimilar reason that that he free storm movement so it's established movement throughout new zealand uh and it had it set up on christchurch in 2018 and I only know this because I looked it up on the internet while we were discussing it and the free store movement was founded in wellington in in 2010 so it's been around for a while they're a non-profit charitable organisation run 100 by volunteers and I actually think we need to give kudos to their um suppliers so um um all priests espresso valentines black and white coffee cartel catnap cafe good habit habit green coffee and eatery grizzly baked goods hello sunday little bruise espresso luxe espresso mustache cookies raw sugar cafe southside social the great pastry shop totally gluten-free bakery under the red veranda underground coffee and west end stories and these cafes give them the leftover food at the end of the day so they're only open between 5 and 6 30 daily and they have a barbecue on a friday I think on a friday and as I say 100 volunteers I actually agree with council staff the recommendation you're a 100 voluntary organization to get tied up with the admin but I also agree to discourage the employment of staff once you get into the employment of staff then you bring in health and safety you bring in acc obligations you bring in all sorts of there are so many different obligations that come with employment I do note that they are on grace vineyard's site and I'm I assume that they're not paying the the rental for the place it looks as if there's been a supplier who has um provided them with a sorry a that they've got a friend's page so richard preston holmes has given them the fit out for their um for their shipping container darren paddock has done all of their designs and architectural work and grace vineyard has given them a home I just think they're doing all the right things and I'd like us to support them thank you pauline you look I agree with what my colleague leanne has just said too great example of collaboration that's what it smart change strategy that we've just signed off for consultation in our program nine towards zero waste um currently 157 000 tons of food waste per year across new zealand is dumped and I'd say most of this food would be waste if it wasn't collected by people like this doing this and it demonstrates my point in the last debate that yes there is a cost to climate change mitigation there is a cost to managing our resources and greening our city and this is just one example of a cost that we're willing to contribute to help this really good cause so I'll be I'll be supporting it today thank you anything further and yep concur I think we have to get better at actually networking and and bringing these groups together so that we're not replicating costs that we keep replicating so I'm really keen if we could get some kind of as I said some kind of city map where we can see what people are doing who's working with who and how we can actually help mission that we fund uh we we fund social workers um in partnership with the city mission that do the job that they're describing here so it makes sense for them to be connecting with that and actually using that service that's already there that we we actually do fund partly and if then is a greater need then we need to look again at how we can resource that so um it's about working smarter and we have to have an understanding of what's happening um over the entire city so that we can do that so I would love if someone could get a map or maybe through smart view be able to identify where where places are so that we can give that information out to those who um agencies particularly who would like to use them thank you um no one further okay I'll put that then all open favor please say aye any against so that recorded yep okay so time against uh I declare that carried and we can take a quick break please be back here by 20 of reports before the um briefing start back with the request for the removal of a conservation covenant from property title 42 colombo street the brendan welcome when we get there yep um so I'll take the paper as that's the only question I've got okay okay so question for brendon um because she valued the house and she wanted it to be protected beyond the resource management act that that's available to anybody they don't necessarily need a grant I didn't_''_7789.92 I've never met her but but she just valued it I think and she wanted to see it protected okay thank you so is there anything else to add to the paper question from james yeah I think the answer is there are 1870 1870 uh reasons it was built in 1870 right okay I read the paper you see okay so we've got one question before I hear from phil and then how long um don't worry about that um no it only came in um late last year because um the previous owner I think she passed get on with the meeting brenda I've got a question when there's really straightforward things like this is there a way that we can look at delegating these kind of decisions so there's some work that can be done in the background um on heritage stuff are these kind of things just to be delegated to staff um I think I think you would need to to delegate stuff that with another report not right now not right now but if there can be some work going on that looks at some of this work and I know we're looking at some of the covenant stuff with the blue plaques as well then maybe to wrap it all up together to to try and speed up the process somewhat yep yeah yeah no it's been moved I've got tim and phil for moving in secondly especially if you put in the pa you know about staff delegation because if the building's no longer there there would be a bit of a hint in that yep yeah so maybe have a look at seeing we could um speed up those processes away but that would be great so one more question from yani and then we'll move through do we know if this building's got a section one two four has it had any building act notice but on it the building is gone so the building was um very very badly damaged in the february earthquake and was demolished under eoc it never even survived through to the sierra era right it was gone within a few weeks yeah okay yeah no I just got the dates right wrong so there you go okay so tim has moved filled his second letter do we have any further questions no any debate not in that case I'll put the motion all in favor please say aye any against to declare that carried thank you very much uh approval of extension for time for a heritage incentive grant for 141 high street okay mike and andrew are going to move in second but brendan do you have anything to add to the report no no I think it's pretty pretty straightforward favor please say aye any against I declare that carried thank you very much um and now we move on to the christchurch heritage festival 2020 um the deborah welcome thank you um and do you have a presentation for us or is it just it was just um for your information really I'm just here if there's any questions okay uh so I'll take the report as read do people have any questions on the report no in that case do I have a mover leanne secondary tim any debate no all those in favor please say aye any against declare that carried thank you very much thank you that's really straightforward um I didn't know that they were going to be quite that straightforward but I also I'll explain it in a second after anne has um wound up the meeting with um al karakia okay here we go okay um and the reason we had the break then is that we're going to move it straight into the representational view and make sure that everyone's still here everyone's very yeah okay you
Next is the spread and cashmere community board and I think rather than carolyn today we've got um lee sampson deputy chair and you've got someone with you I've got a two ic yes this is aubry hello aubry is she the youngest that we've had in front of this counselor I've had baby before there you go she does come to some briefings so she's kind of a little bit used to this but yeah that is very sensible I can't listen to it thank you thank you no problem we've obviously got apologies from carolyn she had a wee eye up yesterday so um you know caroline should be bouncing back in next couple of days but we do wish her a speedy recovery so and hence the two ic obviously we've got joe wells with us today an aubry um no parties from our community board so we just asked that this report is received and significant projects in our ward I'll just briefly go through those and we've got the dyers dyers past safety works it's just something we've got to nut out and do there's obviously 7.2 million of safety improvements it's a little bit disruptive but we've just got to get on and do it I think the information that's been given out has been quite good and the contact numbers so um it is problematic especially at weekends but we've just got to get on and do it and pioneer we're doing earthquake strengthening there at the moment um but just note that a lot of facilities are still open so I just want to reiterate that that the fitness center is still open learn to spin it swim is still opening such as the main pool and sparring and spar of sauna that's closed at the moment and similarly the northwest arc that's all but finished through our ward as well so really really pleased to see that really come to fruition really really quickly so um it's actually yeah from going there a couple months before christmas to see that already done that's fantastic so great project great you a bit of a snapshot of the last four to six weeks and also look at some of the forthcoming events so this is self library christmas market so this is a farmers market that we held on the 24th of december and we have been trying to activate the spaces around south library for years yonks and I want to give kudos to joe and also emma pavey for being quite inventive about how we brought this to fruition so um so christmas eve and we had a heap of people turn up as you can see on the photos it was embraced by the library staff it was embraced by the cafe and so I think that's we need to have a bit more be a bit more creative how we activate the spaces around our facilities as well um especially self library just it could fit so much better on its context in responding to the to the river you know and the spaces around it so just a great event and it's local currencies it's fresh produce it's all the things that was a great great event and we watch this space we want to try and make that happen more and more in the future and I think a few people have talked this morning about the value of local events and I know alex spoke about that earlier but um this was a wee event that we had on uh barrington park um we just you know sausage sizzle had some games out and but you know we had 150 people turn up and this is again this is about bringing community together at very low cost um and this built on our we had a superheroes event about 18 months ago so we're just trying that formula again and we worked in with the library on sprite at spraydon so great little event okay innovating streets um we have a report coming back next month and this has been a really really well it's been a really interesting process so we're obviously this is a bottom-up project where we're working hands-on with the community it's it's not always been easy um I community has quite high aspirations and I think sometimes it gets dumbed down by what are nzt regula you know regulations or council regulations so um I've got to give some more kudos to claire piper there the way she's worked with that community and and maybe tempered expectations a little bit but we've we've got a program we something's going to be happening in there so and it's going to be a really great pilot so so we've got the beckenham um project and we've also got the spraydon project so um really great to see innovative projects coming into our community so thank you what have we got next we have so this is another pilot in our ward so we've been this is a legacy issue for cashmere spreading spreading cashmere the retirement village on rose street um they do all of their laundry from the city from the one site and what we found is that odors have been um passing the boundary ecan have now got a new app that they're pilot piloting and with to actively track when there's been any indus indiscretions so now we're taking so now we've agreed we've all agreed that there's a problem and now it's it we're now trying to move into a collaborative phrase where we're trying to get this issue fixed with ecam but we there's a little app that they've invented that we've that we've been able to track when odours have passed the boundary and now I've agreed as an issue we've just got to get down and to solve it so really nice to see what's been a long-running issue to hopefully hopefully coming to an end so I know melanie's been quite active with this one as well so so that's we're getting somewhere and this is the age-friendly spreading cashmere really starting to get wings as well um we have had a student working for us from the canterbury university they've been mapping out any potential shortcomings in our bus stops and also um proximity or yeah proximity to seats as well we had dr dr angela curl who's actually from otago university but she had recruited mohammed maize from kante canterbury university to do the mapping the analysis work and report on the shortcomings so now we've got the data it leaves us in a position where we can start to advocate for our community so it's another great work stream coming out of the age friendly project that we're running locally so that so what we've got in front of us here is a youth festival so this is the 27th of february and I think there's a few things happening that day so but um so this is about raising um yeah this is about raising awareness about um the risk of teen suicide so we know that's one of societals statistically it's shocking isn't it in new zealand at the moment so um it's it's gonna be an event it's a it's a motorcycle tour which is going to go from the good home in ferrymede to little river and then to hoon hay park events and the event is supported by um crossover trust and tribal nations motorcycle community as a community entity and spreading youth community trust rowley resource center suburbs rugby and obviously the council so we are gently highlighting suicide awareness and prevention and we're expecting anywhere between 50 to 200 riders so I'm hoping melanie's gonna dust off your harley from you garage you've got a scooter mate I don't know if that counts to get to the river but um but yeah no um it's going to be a great event and um lots of things happening on the 20th 27th at hoon hey park from 1 o'clock when the motorcade kind of arrives at the at the park so great work great work and I'm not going to go into much detail on this and I'm going to leave this to carolyn to talk to next month um I'm going to advise you not to google adult playgrounds though and that's what that's what I've been told not to but um but seriously it's the community and we know we know um we know we're living more insular lives we know we need to keep communities connected and so there is a serious conversation to be had so we've approved a visibility study it was a joy to see that picture in the paper absolute joy yeah that's the lady that invented sex and drugs and rock and roll that is right apparently so yeah apparently so but um hey um so but yeah it's good to have the conversation and we look forward to seeing what the feasibility study comes back with so um that in a nutshell is us but it's been a really positive few weeks to be honest and lots of fun things happen on the community level so thank you any thank you are there any questions questions uh tim first of all thanks lee for jumping in for um carolyn um with regards to the bupa issue just the and melanie's been doing a great job on it it is and I think for us to look at in our district plan pushing in is that bupa basically you have a number of rest homes and to obviously make it more efficient you have one laundry for them all because they're all under the as in hospitals same terms in a district plan which is not right and this has been an issue going on for many many years with regards to the local residents having smells from a commercial laundry basically because they all the laundry comes from all over christchurch to one laundry because it's a big facility it's allowed in our district plan and yet it's another thing we do have to address and look at because this is just just going to keep happening throughout the city so yeah but thank you thank you for highlighting it there are a number of issues like that that yeah you're happy to move and seconded by melanie so I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you that's carried thank you very much
Uh approval of extension for time for a heritage incentive grant for 141 high street okay mike and andrew are going to move in second but brendan do you have anything to add to the report no no I think it's pretty pretty straightforward okay any questions from councillors any debate all those in favor please say aye any against I declare that carried thank you very much and now we move on to the christchurch heritage festival 2020 um the debra welcome um and do you have a presentation for us or is it just it was just um for your information really I'm just here if there's any questions okay so I'll take the report as read do people have any questions on the report no in that case do I have a mover leanne secondary tim any debate all those in favor please say aye any against declare that carried thank you very much thank you that's really straightforward um I didn't know that they were going to be quite that straightforward but I also explain it in a second after karakia come on okay here we go
A request for the removal of a conservation covenant from property title 42 colombo street that brendan welcome when we get there yep um so we'll take the paper as that's the only question okay okay so question for brendan because she valued the house and she wanted it to be protected beyond the resource management act that that's available to anybody they don't necessarily need a grant yeah I didn't_''_33.84 I've never met her but but she just valued it I think and she wanted to see it protected okay thank you so is there anything else to add to the paper question from james yeah I think the answer is there are 1870 1870 uh reasons it was built in 1870 right okay I read the paper you see okay so we've got one question before I hear from phil and then um don't worry about that um no it only came in um late last year because um the previous owner I think she passed away last year okay can we just pour let's get on with the straightforward things like this is there a way that we can look at delegating these kind of decisions so there's some work that can be done in the background on heritage stuff are these kind of things just to be delegated to staff um I think I think you would need to to delegate stuff that with another report not right now not right now but if there can be some work going on that looks at some of this work and I know we were looking at some of the covenant stuff with the blue plaques as well then maybe to wrap it all up together to to try and speed up the process somewhat yep yeah no it's been moved I've got tim and phil for moving in secondly especially if you put in the pa yo about staff delegation because if the building's no longer there there would be a bit of a hint than that yeah so maybe have a look at seeing if there's some of those things the covenants that we could um speed up those processes away but and then we'll move through do we know if this building's got a section one two four has it had any building act notice but on it the building is gone so the building was was um very very badly damaged in the february earthquake and was demolished under eoc it never even survived through to the sierra era right so it was gone within a few weeks yeah okay yeah no I just got the dates wrong okay so tim has moved his second letter do we have any further questions no any debate no in that case I'll put the motion all in favor please say aye any against to declare that carried thank you very much uh approval of extension for time for a heritage incentive grant for 141
Support for mayor's joint statement on accelerating climate change climate adaptation in cities and leanne if you'd like to do this one for us I apologize this is um a report on uh an invitation that I received to participate in the 1000 cities adapt now global program uh which was which I assessed to be in line with actually all of the things that we've just been debating the joint statement which I signed up to on our behalf looks at the shared principles that drive cities climate adaptation actions so in many respects I mean I didn't participate in the debate on the last item because I knew I would be uh discussing it here but in a way I wish we weren't talking about climate change I i wish we were talking about climate um resilience and and action and in the same sort of breath because climate change is is kind of passive it's it's it's what's happening you know climate is changing but our response to it has got to be about building resilience and that we have been um a part of uh since um 2013 and uh and essentially the um the work that's been done in a number of areas that have focused on the need for cities to take action so so I've just presented it to you and so all the resolution asks is that we receive the report and that we note our role in progressing the 1000 cities adapt now global program and as I said it ties in with the work that we're doing it also ties in and I did speak about two things in particular I mean christchurch is a very small city compared to the other cities that were involved in the and the um uh the the online conference that I spoke at and or the mayor's forum and uh I spoke about our engagement um with manafenoua and and how significant the role of our local ewe in terms of climate change adaptation was and that the fact that they had taken a leadership role within their own um rohi and I also spoke about the significance of the terms of coastal hazards and the preparation work that's going on the investment in what 23 communities around the climate change adaptation planning often people wonder what the value is around international networks and I just want to mention one thing that's happening next tuesday and it is as a direct result of our engagement in this network and and that is um we have uh hank ovink who is the special envoy for international water affairs for the kingdom of the netherlands um who as people might know was involved in the hurricane sandy rebuilding task force is the principle of rebuild by design the author of too big which I have a copy of in my office if anyone wants to borrow it but it is rebuilt by designs transformative response to climate change arising out of the the hurricane sandy rebuild that the connections between the netherlands and and and our own little city of christchurch on the other side of the world is significant his knowledge around water flood risk management water governance building um with nature and living with water they're all now um and it's also relevant to the work that we need to be doing around a a number of things surrounding water governance and all of the issues that we're having to confront in that area so I'm just the report really speaks for itself and I'm just simply asking that you note our role I've not committed us to any sort of financial undertakings of just looking around the table I've simply said that these are important issues for us and that accelerating and scaling climate adaptation actions uh in a thousand cities around the world by 2030 is a very good objective and one that we want to support thanks leanne_``_303.039 I first came across this at the business and climate change conference last year and the british high commissioner at that point was encouraging cities to join so it's been really good do you have any questions for the end jimmy those are 1000 cities to focus on still going on by 2030 one thousand cities um that people are begging people are cities are being invited already yeah yes they're going on by they're yeah the um under the joint statement is founded on five shared principles that will drive the climate adaption focusing on equity in the vulnerable and poor communities and adaption of climate resilient actions what does that mean uh in terms of ensuring that there is equity I think what it identifies is that around the world a lot of particularly vulnerable communities in terms of impoverished communities live in low lying land areas alongside rivers or close to the coastline and they are particularly impacted by climate change and sea level rise and of course other disasters as well when I spoke to um the former head of the un development programme um helen clark at a conference um a while back she said that all of the work that they do in terms of undp investment is actually investment in resilience and it because there is no point building back the way things were and re-exposing people to the vulnerabilities that they were exposed to that caused the problem in the first place it's actually about building resilience to their model of investment for a very long time so is it about lifting them out of poverty or just adjusting the environment around them no it's about being um well lifting them out of poverty I mean I heard what you said before in the climate change uh paper um it is true that people that are and uh you know who are poverty-stricken find themselves in uh in in more challenging situations but but it it it does mean that people need to be um it does mean that cities that have vulnerable and poor communities that are that are living in environments that are particularly vulnerable then they need to that their situation needs to be catered for so I mean I don't I don't think that these apply equally in every every city setting right but there will be some cities that have extremely vulnerable communities alongside rivers and if you look at the impact of drought if you think of what of how many millions of people for example are dependent on the ganges and you you apply a drought scenario or population you're talking major um major uh uh trauma being imposed on on communities so it's just it it's looking at whether communities themselves are in the position to um adapt uh and and and you'll notice that advocating for local leadership and empowerment and funding to gain leverage and scalable action the government has already said that it is going to have to participate here in new zealand around some of the most vulnerable communities to sea level rise around the country and there are people that are very wealthy in those communities and there are people that are not so wealthy in those communities all around new zealand so it's just about finding an equitable way forward right any further questions nope okay in that case I'm happy to move it happy to move it and pauline's second no any debate no in that case I'll put the motion all in favor please say aye aye any against oh that's carried thank you very much thank you um so I think what we'll do
Deputations all right so now we move on to the tahi christchurch climate change strategy for welcome emma up please all right good team there thank you very much um and uh I think I'll just hand straight to you to introduce the paper and then I know that we've got some questions around the table great thank you so christ church needs a comprehensive and long term approach to address both the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change the strategy has been really designed as our blueprint for collective action to address those and very much working with our partners and stakeholders to achieve that we recognise that we can't do this alone and we need everybody on board so the strategy is designed as a long-term framework but we recognize this won't be the um the only climate change strategy it'll be something that we will continually uh update as we um as the science and as we sort of involve developing the programs together with the community so the strategy is designed around four goals to reduce emissions adapt to do that to ensure a just transition and there are 10 programs structured around supporting achievement of those goals so um we've got lots of evidence that climate change is top of mind for people and we surveyed the community about 18 months ago and had close to 000 respondents and they said that climate change was extremely important issue to them and recently again in the greater christchurch 2050 survey that came through very strongly around protecting the environment and as a key concern and focus for the community so in developing the strategy we've used the scientific evidence available we've incorporated a lot of the information from the regional climate change risk assessments and we've got data that looks at our emissions and that's all informed the development of the strategy in terms of engagement we've engaged both internally and externally so we've had a technical advisory group help us with developing the strategy with representation there from the universities youth groups like gen zero unions and community groups and business and we've also in our sort of conversations through we got a lot of really good ideas and feedback that we've drawn on as the basis for the strategy and we've also engaged with naitahu so we've talked to them in developing but most importantly how we're actually going to engage with them on an ongoing basis to develop the programs and we've had discussions with mkt and this has been used to develop a briefing paper to the sixth runanga and we've got a process in place to keep them informed as we develop the programs up so this really sets out the direction and program of work and now is the opportunity to recommend our recommendations that we go out for public consultation and get the views of the community on the strategy and also to establish a working group really to guide the direction of our ongoing work thank you and can you just um just briefly explain how this aligns with the long-term plan of course yes so um climate change is very much a pillar of the long-term plan so we've uh through the development of that through the activity plans to make sure that we're embedding climate change into the thing thinking and future planning and the strategy would then complement and set up the framework for that ongoing engagement throughout the long-term plan and the actual um sort of decision-making process on the strategy and the long-term plan will be aligned yes so we're proposing to go out and consult um in parallel with the long-term plan and uh so people can submit either through the on the strategy itself or ideas through the long-term plan and then we'll have hearings as part of the long-term plan to inform the final decision that's great thank you under questions from people so pauline yani jimmy thank you and thanks for the work on this the programs are they in any order of priority from one to ten or are they all in parallel does anything have priority over another they're not intended to be I mean we would look to feedback on that they're all really important so we haven't really set our mind to a prioritization we what so sort of or the leadership and partnership so that would be something we would want to be looking at early on uh so that's sort of laying the foundation for the way that we're going to work with the community but otherwise and they really span across sort of their adaptation and mitigation space so we haven't prioritised them yeah um you can I appreciate we've got adaptation mitigation but I'm just wondering if we've got enough focus on reduction and I think our main issue was in the transport and that's why I asked if it was prioritized because maybe transport could be number one in the program and we could possibly work with our partners and look about how we can incentivize more use of um different modes of transport and public transport uptake which would have the most direct benefit to us yeah I mean we certainly know that transport emission you know the transportation is a large um component of our emissions so that will be something we need to tackle but we sort of weighed that up adapt to the changes from climate change you know how you balance that so it's on the reduction is around what we can do now but yeah we wanted to balance it with the planning but yeah we did have some debate about sort of how they were ordered right if it's um helpful pauline uh conceptually uh what the approach has been is to uh there's three stages effectively the first is the measure the second is to reduce and then the third is to offset end so we've got a very good understanding uh now through the measurement and we've already been doing some reducing but that's where the next big opportunity is and in transportation to achieve a just transition you need to do actions in parallel some will deliver in the short term some will deliver in the medium and some in the long term um but if you just focus on the short term ones um then you'll never start the medium and long term ones and there's often long lead in times particularly in the offsetting come to um sequestration um we need to have started so um it takes a long time to grow the forests um in terms of the offset space so we do need to do these in parallel not just focus on um where the biggest emissions are because that might be different to where the biggest reductions can be or equally where the biggest offset opportunities are right okay that's interesting and just quickly if I may on the on the waist we seem to have focused on composting whereas maybe we need to mention you know that we have a direction towards anaerobic and so that we capture that carbon dioxide and reduce the methane as well so just wondering if we need something in there about that and as our direction as well um yeah and the other thing is that we talked about trees I mean what can we do to protect the trees that we have now with the residential intensifications we've got no ability to protect trees on private land have we and some of them are quite big ones and I know so I suppose it will be with a district plan but yes so um on our internal steering board we've got anthony shadbolt and also david griffiths to make sure that we are looking at the programs in light of the tree policy yeah and the um you know the opportunities through the district plans yeah but it's how do we accelerate all that work because this is it's time dependent this and time is of the essence yeah there is work going on at the moment on the urban uh forest plan on the christchurch bank spencer urban forest plan to increase um plantings across the city as well so that work will be coming through to you soon yep and just one final question if I may um so there is the budget attached to this at the moment is there anything or will that come through the consultation in the ltp so the um initiatives are funded through the ltp across the various um aspects so for example um the work that looking at electric the electrification of the fleet um for our own the information provided by bruce rendell is that the proposed investment is 42 million over 10 years so that's an example of what's in the lgp and then in the consultation document we've got the other investment there in uh you know waste transportation cycle yeah and the other parts of the um yes thank you thanks jani just kind of there's lots of actions that are described but there's no budget or time frame so I'm just concerned that we keep adopting strategies without understanding the financial cost and impact on both the organization and and the community in terms of being able to pay for it so how do we get around that so that when we adopt something when we put it up for consultation a people can see how much we're going to spend on it but b when we improve it we can actually have confidence that it will happen because we did have a previous time um smart strategy and that I mean that's my second question is there's no analysis of why that one I think until we understand that it's kind of hard to have confidence going forward like we just split that into two so if we yeah if we if we look at the the time frames and budgets my understanding is that that's why we're aligning this with the ltp that's right so that the actual funding of initiatives is identified through the ltp so those are the examples like the investment in electrifying council's fleet and the investment in cycleways examples so the funding that we give out through the biodiversity fund and sustainability fund so there's those initiatives across um the programs of work and particularly in the transport space and three waters any what we want to do is get the feedback and ideas from the community and get some look at what some of those will be and some of those will require funding some of those will be more sort of engagement activities which we have some plans around and some budget for but until we really get the input only then will we actually have the detail around it is going to take I mean there's urgency around it but it's also going to be a long-term approach and I think it's a good question though it's one that the climate change commission has grappled with in their draft advice for um the exact question like what's the cost to the country um of uh understanding a just transition and over what time period um and that's both the what's it going to cost but what are the um what's the alternative of uh not investing and uh I'm sure councils were conscious that the um the latest climate change commission advice is that the um cost is considerably less than what it was forecast to be just two years ago um but there's no it's in the billions of dollars at a national level um there's no easy way that we can see if what we're trying to achieve is to um embed um future thinking about the impacts of climate change and do all of our work so every time we design a allows for higher flood levels um or high rainfall or whatever it is every time we do a stormwater swale that we do that cognizant of the impacts of climate change and so extracting out all of those budgets um is a very large job and might not advance the actions that we want to just sorry just to be really clear if we go to the draft strategy and look at the focus areas have have we quantified how much each of those will cost so that when the community says I like that's priority focus area and you know I support it or I'm concerned about that one is there a way that people can see how much we've got a budget I mean I i have to say someone who cheered the draft water integrated strategy and still can't get progress on the reuse of um grey water and rain water and are told that there's not the resource to do it there's a whole bunch of things in here that kind of signal to me that actually they're going why I'm really keen that when we agree to this that we can actually get progress on it rather than just adopt a whole bunch of things that sound good but don't end up in us actually doing the work well I think that um the decisions that you make here um if you're committed to these decisions the challenge is to make sure that they flow through into the long-term plan so for example if you're committed to low emissions transport um the investment that you make in active travel and cycle ways in public transport infrastructure those are your decisions that you'll ultimately make through the ltp um I don't think it's prudent it wouldn't be prudent to preempt those decisions through the allocation of a budget at a strategy level yeah the other thing to note is that the next step for council under each program has been included and budgeted for the focus areas themselves the way the the document is designed is to be a very long term approach working with the community to actually develop up work with our partners with naitahu with other partner agencies and the community to develop up our actions on there so they won't all appear in the first one two or three years sort of these are it's a very long-term approach that we need to take with the community um so it's not just one package that everything in this document will will um immediately occur it's it's almost like a framework for action for the future it's just you know that that's my concern because that's what we did in 2010 and we had very specific actions and we actually didn't see stuff happen so I don't want to repeat what happened then which is what I mean you know I'll keep raising I think it's a really good point I think that the fact that we are going out for consultation on this and signing it off at the same time as the long-term plan that we can be making those budget decisions at the same time but can we get like a high level implementation yeah it's just there's just so little information can we get at least something like an a4 or you know a few pages of here's the kind of high level yeah I think that through with the engagement team I think that um being able to put through maybe some links through to the stuff in the ltp that addresses the key projects might be really useful um but before we go into the next question and I've got a long list of people um the climate smart strategy yani mentioned as well could you just talk about because this isn't our first climate strategy no the climate smart strategy was um one of the first climate uh strategies across the country so um in fact we came out early and um we've achieved a huge amount through that strategy and the fact that we're redoing a strategy now simply reflects that um in the decades since the climax climate smart strategy was implemented the science has changed fundamentally we didn't have the ipcc we didn't have emissions trajectories we to limit um the temperature rise um and it simply reflects I think what um emu was saying before that um we'll redo this strategy in two or three years time I suspect because the science will have changed and our understanding and our knowledge of um what trajectories globally we're on what trajectories nationally or on what trajectories at a city level we're on will have changed uh over that time so I wouldn't um see the fact that we're redoing a strategy as a failure um actually we added we had achieved a huge amount through the climate change strategy and and I'm hopeful that we'll do the same thing through the strategy and the climate smart strategy was mostly focused on council as an organization yeah yeah so that's good okay um jimmy okay thank you I have two questions first one is regarding to the engagement and the consultation because I'm particular concern this one is focus on it's not only you know one way which I give the community the you know information proper information other ones in response you know how to work together particular focus on those the action the program quite a few is in relation to the wider the community one of our other community outcome is the voices you know to be heard from all the cultures and ages by ages maybe we consider all different ages political use children but all those cultures 25 percentage you know responding overseas how do we engage with them that's a big you know the kind of potential community can in response positively regarding to all implementation of this strategy what is your plan to engage with them so we think one of the advantages of going out with the ltp is that we can leverage off some of the opportunities where we're having conversations on the ltp um and also talk to communities and um about the climate change strategy so we're working closely with casey and the engagement team and where there are those public events making sure that we're taking those opportunities um in the communities to talk to them about the climate change at the leverage off the conversation that's happening around there so that's uh yeah that's an advantage okay but I just want to remind you because at the group they have the kind of fewer uh media you know particular newspaper radio yes we might engage with them they are big influence to the community yeah second is I'm concerned are particular public transport you know transportation system because every day we are aware our neighboring council from sovereignty and from the wyoming they have the workers come to the crisis several thousands of times in crisis they will create you know this kind of the those carbon emissions etc but how do we to deal with this issue whether this strategy also invited them now have their say how to work together that's a very good question jimmy um I suppose uh what I deserve is um and uh sarah and I were talking about it right we're all global citizens so um the whether the issue is christchurch city district or whether the issue is uh greater christchurch with our relationship with salman and that we do actually you need to put in a national in a global context so um we're not going to have fundamentally different co2 emissions or resulting temperature increases um in christchurch city that don't also flow over into wimac and selwyn and don't flow over nationally so this is a global ecosystem that we need to put ourselves in um the challenge with that though is not falling into the trap of thinking that you can't do anything because um it's a global challenge it's a global challenge with local solutions so um as the district and as individuals in uh christchurch city we need to be doing everything that we can to make a dent here um we can't uh simply abdicate our responsibility as global citizens um because other people aren't doing things and that includes advocating strongly at both an official and a governance level that our neighbouring tas also undertake their planning and their actions including on those areas that you've talked about with a high level of single use occupancy vehicles traveling um from that's one of the big challenges for the urban form for christchurch christchurch city has done some things to increase the density of our city and to provide alternative choices for people to live but there are some downsides to that as well so I think that'll be the challenge that we face over the next few years um is how do we get those settings right about urban form um so that we don't have urban sprawl that contributes to um increased emissions through private transport but equally we get the balance between um density and amenity values of communities that people live in thank you thanks aaron yeah I've got a few but they're all pretty quick so um I'll just work through them is there any cost benefit analysis on any of the programs we're doing just so it's measurable so you know dollar in dollar out or uh this is a question to what you asked yesterday um I've done a bit of research on your question from yesterday so um in general terms um the um measure energy because cycling um consumes more energy and there's between five and twenty percent sorry between a five and twenty percent um less ah sorry um the emissions if if uh transport emission from a vehicle is 100 um the emissions uh from uh cyclists are between five and twenty percent um of those tenants and missions so um you'd get somewhere between twenty twenty and five um cyclists for the same emissions is what a vehicle produces it's not a exact science though in so there's not a one for one kind of cost benefit that you would create because cycling consumes more energy and depending on where you get that energy from if you're a meat eater for example then um that probably negates the benefit of cycling um in terms of its emissions but it does have a whole range of other um well-being benefits as well so the answer to your question um is it varies and it depends and I'm I'm afraid there's not an exact um business case ratio that you can apply to this is under development is low emission transport and they will be doing a lot more analysis in terms of the cost benefit uh packages can I just just let's just um pause those just with look at the the strategy for the work that we're planning to do um and the overall national stuff on cost benefit that a lot of that sort of stuff's being done though hasn't it so yeah so all of because aaron's asking specifically for cost benefit work and are we able to point people in the direction of other cost benefit work on climate action that's been no we should show in all of it like when we go to spend um you know a million dollars on a bus or on on anything we should be able to show the benefit cost wise is this and the carbon is this that mean that there should be pretty clear charge to make up yeah so I'm just going to ask there is some work that can be done on sort of whole of life costs um and at and actually it's not just thinking about it in terms of economic costs but it's actually thinking about it within that framework of um you know the broader costs in terms of um cultural economic yeah and yeah and healthy so you can think about it in terms of economic costs but it is that cultural social and environmental that we also need to be weighing up uh and I think yeah yeah but we you we have to do that because it's not a bottomless pit of money and it's like do I build um say a bus stop here or do I give someone cancer drugs you've got to make a choice absolutely yeah and there is I think one of the things that's really important is that we um identify what are the things that we want to do locally and invest in and then what's the things that we can actually advocate to central government and that so you know our submission on the climate commission's um draft advice that's really important that we make that better um give an effect to at the national level than they are locally so that the stuff we're doing locally is actually about engaging with the community and that's why I think this work that's being done through the coastal hazards adaptation program that stuff that's local and involves our community is actually where we're going to get real sort of value from and can I just check though you have included in the strategy in the background documents the costs of inaction so the estimated costs of the impacts of climate change we haven't_''_1687.679 um put that into the document but we can look for some links in that and the other thing to think is a lot of this is going to be on the it's like intended to be a digital and a lot of it on the website so it'll be um there but with a lot of supporting information and we want to drive people to the website so all this sort of information people can then go to that and see that there rather than within the information provider for people to look at absolutely yeah thanks aaron right yeah so um then the next one out at three directions I remember you said the last one was offset what were the other two remember conceptually so hang on what was the first time measure measure reduce reduce offset right so then speaking globally and that's why you almost don't want to use the equation of if we do nothing because we're so small that you the needle wouldn't move at all you just couldn't even measure it on a global impact but and that's if we did everything if we just almost stopped moving you just wouldn't notice um but that's globally speaking where we could have the most impact globally is by solving the problems not trying to uh just rearrange the deck chairs but putting our investment into the science that will fix the problems are we doing that aaron yeah is that something for our strategy would you like to see council investing in science well we do we do have partnerships with and it is important so you know through our work that we're doing with the deep south and we're contributing to that and we're partnering with university of canterbury to contribute to that science which actually um is you know some of that contributes to the global science and actually we've got members you know in canterbury on um ipcc panel and we've um engaged with them so that's the way we're contributing our thinking to that kind of global if it's that the other one's monitoring the problem what are we contributing to the solutions but we're just we're only looking at the actual strategy itself not everything all that kind of stuff but we could solve this one yeah are there things in the strategy that aren't there that you would like to see there before it goes out of consultation well I just think we're a pretty smart city that we could be part of the solution rather than just monitoring the problem and mitigating the end result not fixing it no no that it's not I think about changing the energy if you reduce the emissions the planet's still going to warm up that's why we're mitigating yeah we do have a program on um economic transformation and innovation to really highlight some of that stuff you're saying and working with christchurch and z and others to focus on some of the innovation and solutions behind that that was the answer I was looking for thank you yeah it's there right um anne thank you so um I was just reading through it's a page 42 somewhere around there sorry page 18 actually we have actually outlined some of the economic benefits for example the led lights saving a million dollars a year in electricity costs uh six hundred thousand dollars in maintenance I don't think we have to look far to see um economic benefit however this is a question um an extra 10 seconds in terms of um implementation implementation doesn't have to cost much either um so I'm wondering um the climate change working group can you see their what way do you think we are I mean we'll be looking for some direction um I think in a good example is the coastal hazards adaptation program the working group through that so it'll be identifying some sort of key areas of priority that we can work on and then actually coming up with I you know some of the initiatives that we want to put in place and doing that collectively we've had already discussions around doing some focus on really the communication to underpin that behaviour change program and how we're going to engage with the community so I think that that is something that we can do together um you know with other partners and actually one of the projects funded through the sustainability fund was a series of christchurch conversations around climate change so that's something we could see working closely with elected members on in terms of engagement we know that our young people are leading the way here with with this work and just wondering what you have in mind in terms of engagement with young people uh probably the expertise um but we have got a couple of members who are on our technical advisory group but katie's so we'll be working in with ltp opportunities this is where I really hope to be able to capitalize on on both of those things so we've got a dedicated program for youth engagement as part of the ltp and hand in hand we'll be taking the climate change strategy because obviously as a core part of the ltp climate change is going to be of interest to them it follows that the climate change strategy will also be of interest to them and so we just dovetailing in specifically have you identified groups within youth uh who will be targeted we're going to be guided uh by what uh youth council and um committee tell us um would be our best approach on that one we do have some stakeholders but obviously we'd like to ask our youth hardly like to be engaged beast thank you andrew thank you just want to focus on the um consultation timeline so just noting previous the ltp and about consulting on it and signing it off at the same time what are the actual proposed dates for the consultation the hearings and the final decision so the document goes out for consultation on the 12th yeah march to the 24th of april so it's just that one week longer than the ltp yep and then with a view to um doing all of the submission analysis um uh ready for the hearings um so that you have that information available and also have the information um themed information from the ltp so it's all together as a package the hearings making can speak to with more authority but we're running them at the end of the hearings as I understand it so that you'll have the benefit of all that information when you hear the submissions on the strategy so the end of the ltp so the hearings on this will be at the end of the ltp hearings that's the plan yeah and then decision making on this strategy how does that align with decision making on the ltp's okay so yeah the hearings were the exact dates of all of those you know all the hearings we haven't exactly nailed down because it depends on how many people want to be heard but we're looking at having the ltp hearings and then the climate change ones kind of at the end of that period and then I'm looking at dates um based on what I'm hearing now I'm thinking of aiming for the three june council meeting for the climate change strategy to hopefully feed in in time for the ltp on the 23rd of june I think all right so the intention is that the decision on climate change strategy will be made before the decision on ltp that's exactly what I'm driving at and then a second question which I'm pleased to hear that and a second question which is related um people are likely to submit to the ltp on matters that relate to um climate change and are relevant for consideration for this strategy how are we going to handle the inevitable subject crossover between of anticipated that and and it's it's going to be quite difficult to to um yeah to get people to separate the two because you know a person might want to put in a submission that crosses boundaries so because full council will be the hearings panel for the climate change strategy you will all get all the information for from both and it might be a little bit of um you know trying to move people sideways perhaps but it will really depend on what they have to say and um availability as well but I'm hoping that it will be just a matter of you know you've received all the submissions all of you know full council and heard all the hearings for both and then there'll be an analysis that hopefully will tie some of those things together for the um for the climate change strategy decision making as well great thank you um melanie um just on that because you've just brought it up would it be possible to if someone submits on the um on the long-term plan about you want to do a submission on the climate change one if they haven't realized yeah they would actually just direct them to do it I think so I think what if it's if it's just one single item that they've submitted on for the ltp and it's clearly for the climate change strategy I think what we'll do is go back to them and die and and get them to look at the strategy in case they haven't seen it and just ask if they want us to pick it up and put it over which would be the easiest thing for them to do I think my actual question um was um about you talked about engaging with the community um have you thought about um the role of community boards because like there's a few programs in there um that I could see community boards could be probably um quite useful for and the reason I actually noticed is because um for program 10 the sustainable food one of the things we should add I haven't_''_2318.88 picked up're already doing and we should put that in before that goes out so they don't say we've missed it yeah so if we can add that into one of the bullet points that would be good but yeah what have you thought about that um we've sort of had some conversations with community boards but it is an area that we need to do some more consultations so through this um we'll look at how we can make sure that we're engaging with them um because it has been quite informal to date but also like involving them like we had someone come to the board about getting people to cycle and having competitions you know and so there's lots of stuff like that that can be done that's really local yeah and I know when we went out um for public consultation we went out for consultation on setting a target and the community boards came along and you know spoke to sort of particular um areas of how they wanted you know we could be involved so yeah we'll at the end of my list of people for questions is there anyone else no okay any questions on the working group so we've got a list of names up on the screen at the moment sam yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks very much and I flipped through some questions the other day which is brilliant we got essentially everything back except for that one on the parks and the mowing yes around the ecology systems did we get an answer on whether um that the ecowork system will affect the how we maintain our parks and the like I don't have a answer back from parks on that I don't yeah so I just checked brendan would that come under levels of service and stuff rather than yes I'm just trying to record if um you're concerned that we would stop mowing parks um then that's not the case we've kept the levels of service through the ltp through the draft ltp um uh for mowing so we're not proposing anything radical like stopping mowing to let the grass grow free know this there's an area in wilston where there's a group a community just wanted to double check no no yeah there's a community group in wilston who've said that they don't want any spraying and so they've taken over the maintenance of a park yeah no no no I just that was my only thing so that's fine yeah that's all good okay anything further from anyone no I thank you very much thanks for the presentation and um we'll move to the motion I'm happy to move like second do we have any debate yep didn't jimmy then just wanted to get a resolution that we do get some financial information about the time frames so you know I think it's important that we record that so financial and so it's an amendment like here's the previous one we had really clear simple easy to understand actions and costs and timing and I'm just really concerned that we've got none of that for this and we're asking people to give feedback what the best way is to try and get some information but so yeah in what way would that be different to the budgets and time frames set out in the long term plan well it may be just that if staff have got that information then can they just put it into the draft strategy or attach it as an appendix so people can see that'd be great yeah that would be really helpful so it's a proposed amendment just to put some words in there so can I just check katie when it comes to the engagement over this is it possible to put links through two different parts of the ltp with some of the budget lines and things in it or pointing people make best efforts to point people towards um areas uh that that correlate absolutely and the new ltp tool should make things an awful lot easier in that regard as well so um to be able to interrogate the um the database that you've now seen so um yes um I believe we should be able to link um some ever come when we've done a strategy to actually having budget information at the same time for the different streams so do you need a resolution to be able to that says can you do that or can you just do that um we can just do that yeah if that's useful in terms of the operational costs that can't_''_2592.96 be shown with the nutella canada this is very high level it's it's very massive operational cost to do the things in here that we say we're going to do and let's be clear about it we are really good at adopting strategies and then going oh what happened what's your wording so we're going to meet professionals request staff to provide the proposed operational costs associated with the actions okay so can I just have some advice from staff on that because my my reading of your faces I feel as though question when it was asked um uh but obviously um uh council's prerogative uh if you were to accept the amendment um we how do you differentiate good work and is helping um er climate preparedness from um the other work that a park ranger does so I think maybe the best approach would be to use some examples in linking um through to examples but I think um it would be a very challenging task to arrive at the final number of everything across the 500 million dollars that we spend in opex and 600 in capex per year um to which is climate change related and which isn't so yani can you give me a specific example of something in the strategy where you like the costs provide climate education schools and promote youth voices and leadership there will be a cost to that it might be thirty thousand dollars it might be fifty we could link to the enviro schools line in the um okay yep so and there's a number of it goes on and on there's a number of those things work with communities on banks peninsula to develop responses to localised climate issues such as threats to water supply increased wildfire risk and erosion one of the really coming along saying how come we can't_''_2719.28 do this now and the response was well we don't have the resource so again so just let's just remember that this isn't quite your debate yet you're just looking at no no but in terms of just getting the information back you know there's a lot of specifics in here that either have work programs attached or don't and that's the thing that I don't quite understand is what the cost is and I think if people for asking people to make submissions on what we do then people should some sense of what the budget implication is so in what way are we able to do that at this short notice given that we have had two workshops already in a you know um it's it's a lot of work for staff to be doing at a very last minute just ahead of something going up for consultation you can clarify yeah is it to do with the point yeah because mine is a totally understanding get where you're very clear message from the council laws that we're sitting in ltp and it has a budget um maximum so therefore anything that would add money to any project would have to take and cannibalize from somewhere else in the organization so I get totally what you're saying but we need I think I want to hear from the community what they feel and what they see the priorities are for climate change anything over and exceeds already established budgets is for the ce and her team to cannibalize something else because we have we're going to set a target so I think we've kind of in part that would have good to have that information you're asking for yani but the card is before the horse in a wee way hang on a second you've made your point really really clearly we're just trying to clarify what we can do here yeah uh leanne my question is and it's really in relation to yanI's is that does it have to be put in the document at the front end wouldn what has been prepared and then um at the at the um at the point that we're signing off on it which is in the lead up to the ltp we can actually identify what the what the specific actions are arising and the costs associated with them so that they are built into the ltp I i can't see it going any other way but you can you could just simply note that staff will provide um the operational costs along with the agreed actions at the appropriate time so it just seems to me that that would be a far more reasonable way that makes sense and and people will be able to look at the um the costs and the ltp for a range of different projects as well especially the capital projects but um linking through to the enviro schools line those kind of things as well the adaptation planning um that working with the communities would be really good so we're looking at some amendments so we have a note here do you need that as a formal amendment in the resolutions fine as a note wouldn't_:_2906.24 I just I'm sorry for not raising it earlier but when I got point seven of this report the resource implications I was shocked at the fact that there's very little information I would have thought you know we didn't have this in the workshops but this would have been so there are things let's just remember that there are things that are within the strategy that are current work programs that won't be changed by the strategy particularly so the work that we're doing on the cycleways program isn't driven by the climate change strategy it happens to be part of the climate change work we're doing but it's not driven by the strategy so it'll be difficult to pull out what is strategy costs and what is just normal council work um so do we have any more clarifications before we move into debate because I do have a debate list and I just wanted to clarify I know we've moved on from questions to staff but in terms I think the document that we are going to be doing all this work and starting it all and I think maybe the wording could be changed so that we're actually strengthening what's already happening rather than creating new stuff uh it's not intended uh depends on what you describe as we um we as uh everyone is what we're trying to encompass in this uh strategy there is work for council to do there is work for business to do there's work for citizens to do there's work for communities to do there's work for us to do as a country and as a planet so um we're I think it's important to recognize that this isn't um the onus or the responsibility for climate change cannot be solved by council and so intentionally um it's a mix of activities there some are council led some uh where we might agitate to government some uh eat less red meat and cycle more yeah I was just alluding to what yani was saying about providing education I mean there are lots to recreate that we're actually going to build on that utilize it recognise it and strengthen it so that's not going to take any budget from us today okay so let's let's get back because we have had a moved and seconded we've had some clarification we have a note mike you're happy to add the note there um I am too so that's all good so we have a debate list and at the moment it goes yani jimmy and andrew that was the only point so basically I just wanted to try and get as much information to the community when we seek their feedback so they can see what we're proposing understand the cost um and the time frame and so appreciate you've made a sort of note which is probably the best that we can get I do think actually as a council we need to think about all the strategies that we adopt and how we actually make sure that what we say we're going to do gets done because I do think we run without the resource or capacity to deliver in the time frames if you go back to the original climate smart strategy there were a number of really good actions and what's striking about that one and this one is how much similarity there is between the two it's almost like we've just kind of copied what we did in 2010 um but we didn't deliver on and so uh I think there's some really good stuff in here um and let's get it out to the community to get their feedback but let's be really clear if we want to take action in terms of climate change it's going to cost us to do a number of actions that are in here and I personally do think it's important that we signal that to the community so that we can get the appropriate feedback about where the priorities should be thank you jimmy thank you yeah I think uh some of our counselors and mayor we probably remember you know back to the in may of 2019 council actually adopted and and economic emergence the city we are about eight respect to the uh 15th of march the same day you know most attack the same day I was one of councillor we was in the casino square so many young people from so many community team agents requesting a big voice to save for all the the planet you know and also they make submission in the council table deputation we also it's good image even today we are so I'm very happy you know today even a little bit late for almost more than one and a half the the years but at least this draft strategy can come out and today we will adopt as the draft one put on the public the consultation we need to recognize this is quite a serious biggest challenge in our time they because affect so many not only the economic the environment the social culture violence is a big impact so how to in response you know quickly try to serious and integrate working together this that's most important but I think a moment today we uh the you know based on our strategic direction framework you know the every voice we wait every verse every the repair every residence we need to be the humble to listen to them particularly this issue is in relation to the everyone and also our next generation so how to improve those engagement improve those consultation that's very very crucial we need to you know do our best to make the happen the other ones are agree with yani because I review all those the 10 the asian program actually next action plan actually that's true because the staff is the answer the errant concept aaron the the question measure reduce actually important but today maybe in the next stage you know after the the consultation we need to you know step is more detailed action plan implementation plan we set up time frame measurement who is the leading the agency who is the support in the agency detailing then we know which year which the items council need to put in our long term which one is another agency that's their responsibility more clearly then we can successful this is my view thank you thanks jimmy um anne so um we all know and love david attenborough and he one of his quotes is that many individuals are doing what they can but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies and in our economy economics and in our politics and I think that here with council um leading the way with this draft strategy I think we are putting our money where our mouth is and doing that so one of the many strengths I think of the strategy is that it acknowledges what we're already doing within council and connects those things it also stands very strongly on the shoulders of council strategic priority of meeting the challenge of climate change through every means available so I'm proud of this the work and thank you for it and I think also of our leadership in this I look forward to strong engagement with our communities and they're going to give us feedback about what we can specifically do here and then the working group I can see and I i hear what yanI's saying there's no point in having a strategy if we don't have action so I'm sure that this this will lead this process this great engagement that katie's team will lead will actually bring about that action so very supportive thank you um andrew thank you um I'm also um supportive of this um there are a number of key points that the um strategy in my view highlights quite well um we can't do this alone we need to do it in partnership this requires collective action so every individual every household every organization has got a part to play not just the council this requires a multifaceted approach so no single action will make the change on its own but the contribution from a number and variety of actions certainly will so in view of the recent draft advice from the climate commission which is also currently open for consultation this is very timely in fact it's time some would say past time I'm pleased that we're consulting on this draft alongside it it'll help engagement with it arguably this is one of the most significant and important consultations that we'll carry out and I expect the community will have views I hope they do um and I encourage individuals and organizations to make submissions on the draft strategy um I want people to be telling us whether they think this is ambitious enough whether we're challenging ourselves enough whether we're actually doing everything we can whether we're really giving effect to our declaration of a climate and ecological emergency I'm keen to know the community's views on what the quick wins might be what the priorities might be um and I'm also pleased that it'll be the whole council hearing submissions I think that shows just how important this is to us coming back to yanI's point um strategy development's important engaging with the community's importance but it's actually taking the action that delivers meaningful outcomes that's the most important thing here so development and funding of the climate action programs will be essential to this strategy to where funding is already in place and delivering the actions that result from this strategy and in that regard I'm pleased that we'll be making decisions on this strategy before we finalize the long-term plan as we know time isn't on our side here um and some of this action is well overdue thank you melanie um dr um rod car the chair of the climate change commissions um was saying the other week that um new zealand's got 0.06 of the population of the world but currently our emissions are 0.17 so that's means that new zealand makes about three times as much emissions per person than the average nation so actually it's important that we as a country are doing something in that and that christchurch is making this step I think is important so um you know it's about looking to the future and our 2030 and 2045 goals with the net zero emissions um and and again I'm behind the strategy um but I do think when this consultation happens I think the specifics will be very that they're going to come with really specific stuff that they want us to do and probably say there's not enough in this strategy they want to see that because that's what we saw with the waste minimisation plan they really wanted the action plan to be quite clear um and of course that's that's going to be that well that's part of the terms of reference for the climate change working groups I think that we need to take it really seriously when we hear all these things um from the people um to make sure that we are adding there to the implementation of action plan um and that we keep going out to people to check in with them quite regularly about that um and you know it's the small things I just realized I'm I need to get myself a better cup um I'm terrible with that but there are um you know there's all the small things that we can do and like for our board with the edible and sustainable garden awards we've did very little to try and tell people about it I did tell one or two people so um people care um so good on us for doing this and there's hope that we get lots of good information back from everybody thank you pauline thank you thanks for the work on this and we did hear the the expression along this is a long term program but we don't want it to be too long term so we need it to be as short a term as we can but this is a real test for our council for our enabling abilities that we have we've got to really really rely on technology and innovation and we have to embrace change we've got to develop our programs with the community we've got to step up and we must ensure that this runs right through our organisation every department but particularly procurement I believe we want to see that waiting in the procurement it needs to be there for instance with our waste focus should be on energy rather than compost in my view and I'm just reading about bill gates in the paper on the weekend he he quotes a green premium so that's the additional cost of buying green technology because there is a cost for instance an electric car is a lot dearer than buying another one or free buses if we wanted to fund free buses there's a cost to that so we will need budget we may need serious budget and we'll need our partners so I'll be supporting this today and look forward to the feedback from people cheers thank you tim um thank you I think it's a really good idea running alongside ltp we don't have a choice obviously but I think it's going to raise its profile with many of the people that may not have actually wanted or bothered to come out and comment on it I think it's absolutely essential that all of our residents do interestingly though I follow on from what council johansson was going on about we do have to be sensed with the costs and the ongoing operational costs of implementing have a really good heads up at the very start of it so I think to have um give it depth and the value that we see and been talking about it around this table and also nationally and globally we have to have a really good idea of that to give it substance to go forward and as a responsible council trying to keep rates to a minimum we also have to look at if it's going to be above what is expected within our operational capital then we've got to look at where we're going to take it from within our budgets and that is only good good management I think um enviro schools was mentioned in the debates and also innovation etc some of the groups that have been doing this for a long time and getting really good results like environmental and virus schools were almost kind of pushed aside with these new initiatives that came to us which actually aren't new initiatives some people like and virus schools and others have been doing this for a long time so I think really look at what's put in front of us and be careful of what we're funding and supporting those that are actually really getting good mileage and I'll be certainly looking at that because you know we've only got a certain amount of dollars and we've got to get traction for it and we've got to be responsible going forward so thank you thanks tim anyone else yeah yeah um I welcome this going out for consultation and I hope we actually get robust debate not the usual same old same olds telling us the things they've been telling us for the last few years because there's so much to to this debate certainly man's impact on the environment has been massive for quite some time the climate has always changed always will change and when you look back over the last 100 years it's 1965 was the last time that a natural disaster in a natural disaster is drought floods extreme weather extreme temperature landslides dry mass movements wildfires volcanic activity and earthquakes but the last time more than pretty calm since then prior to that there was more than uh once every decade was there more than a million people killed from natural disasters they've always been around what the change was in the 20th century was moving people out of poverty because taking people out of poverty is one of the big key changes to climate change I think new zealand can have a massive influence on global climate change by being a smart leader and coming up with a number of the solutions that will help the world whilst I agree with melanie on the home gardens I have an edible landscape myself with over 30 fruit trees home gardening is not always as good as people think it is because often people drive down to the garden centre to buy two plant two planets of seedlings the carbon footprint of that versus a farmer who mass farmer who mass farms the same vegetables is far far lower and any domestic household that does gardening the chemical usage per square meters far higher than farmers so unless they're farming organic at home and so seeds and you grow your own seedlings and all that you've got a low footprint but if you drive down to the garden center and buy yourself two punnets of seedlings to save the planet you haven't_''_3979.52 um so I look forward to the debate um I'd like to see a lot more cost go into um some of the stuff we do because having a whole lot of 40-seater buses driving around the city with five and a half people on them per average uh won't save the planet um it'll look good especially for all the same color a few people won't even see them but that way it will feel like we're saving the planet but you're not actually saving the planet we need to be smart about what is the next form of energy what is what is the future of energy and I look forward to that because we need to be putting a lot of investment into smart green technology that makes economic sense you can't just heavily subsidize something to make yourself feel good poorest people in our city and across the world and I can hear murmurings from the side but when you go to band gas barbecues to save the planet you might want to just check the emissions level from that because what are you going to cook on now you're going to go back to charcoal so yeah you might want to just check what sometimes the unintended consequences can be so I look forward to a cleaner greener christchurch and I look forward to the debate that will fuel our steps forward because I hope it's a bit more robust than it's been thank you anyone else good night conversation with the people of christchurch administering this presentation I expect that we'll see a number of changes in the strategy um but end of the day the strategy will still be words um as a counselor we set goals that we need to achieve by 2030 which is only and we know that climate change is the biggest intergenerational challenge that we face and says no longer good enough then we actually actually got worse so much more than simply doing what is right both the environment and people most importantly now does not need to cost the rate by any more than what we've just approved it's about prioritizing what gives us the most benefit and I hope between this consultation and the long-term bankruptcy and our communities will give us a strong mandate decades of under investment in public and active transport have created a car culture in our city that has led to high car ownership in a land transport system that contributes 36 percent of our district's greenhouse gas emissions at the draft long term planned meeting yesterday there were councillors who voted against the proposed rate increase calling out the spend on public transport and cycling I do wonder if they actually read the transport program because only six point six percent of the total transport spent is going towards public transport and sixteen point three percent towards cycling it is this car is king attitude that has put us in the position that we face today when we focus on walking cycling and public transport not and well-being connect communities and make our streets safe and more livable as we enter into two important consultations for this city my question to the people of christchurch is are we doing enough do you want true climate action do you want true environmental action do you want true social action mike it would be nice if you mentioned the economy there once as well sam sorry you haven't debated so if you'd like to debate climate change is here and it's ramping up it is not a challenge for some theoretical future generations it's current generations we sit here in an air-conditioned building while outside fire crews are on high alert again and it's not just about costs it's about opportunities there is often concern expressed that mitigating the impact of climate change by reducing emissions will cost councils and rate payers millions and they will and we need to be clear about that but equally certain is that without action now the cost will be much higher and the longer we delay responding the higher the cost will be local government across new zealand face five to eight billion dollars in vital infrastructure lost to climate change in the next 50 years these are only council infrastructure costs pipes roads and facilities and don't include any potential adaptation or protection measures however not only will infrastructure be exposed but so will economic development and growth community health and safety and social support systems in christchurch we carry a lot of this at current emission rates we may be facing a one metre sea level rise by 2100 this would put 300 kilometers of our roads and a thousand kilometers of three waters pipes at risk there are up to 25 000 homes and businesses at risk these are our communities and it's valued at current rates at 6.7 billion dollars we need to act now to try and stop this from being as bad as it could be and the ensuing social costs of relocating families and communities those are the human costs but as we're already seeing a natural environment is impacted too native species like the kakariki karaka are sensitive to temperature change and miniature changes we know how quickly the environment can change and we saw that during lockdown the views from the port hills uh within days were crystal clear across to the southern alps people had more livable communities traffic noise was down people were out on their streets walking and connecting with each other and clients so climate change offers not only these challenges but the mitigating it opers offers opportunities to reshape the way we live and how we do business to improve outcomes for all a greener more livable city with great sustainable transport options and local amenities benefits us all and that's why a transition is important and not a sudden change like covert was making staged investments and behaviour changes will enable us to meet our targets together and not leave anyone behind there will always be those who find excuses not to act on climate change who don't see it as a priority right now or who have no vision for the future but an action in action will cost us as a council it is already costing our communities now and it will cost is what we do has an impact on the planet and it is time to change that from a negative impact to a positive one let's become the 21st century sustainable garden city that residents told us they wanted back in 2011 and let's do it together and with that I'll put the motions to the vote all those in favor say aye any against no past unanimously thank you very much right now we move to item eight the crew
All right carrie thank you very much um any declarations of interest for today a few grand grant applications no that's good uh confirmation of previous minutes will confirm both the um public and private mpx minutes do I have a mover for those jimmy seconder second tim all in favor any against no thank you very much there's no public forum for today and no deputations right so now we move on to the
Um so we now move to apologies we've got apologies for the meeting from councillor mcclellan um and councillor gough and the mayor for lateness those oh yannI's like he's at the principal's breakfast all good um and counselor daniel's for lameness okay thank you okay do I have a movement close mel um and mike uh all in favor and against all right kerry thank you very much any declarations of interest
When we when we get to the um to the plan itself uh there are a number of issues that are highlighted and the recommendation that I want the um the meeting to adopt today is and and it enables us to actually consider all of the issues is set out on the agenda on page 17 uh what uh sorry not page 17 on page 13 to page uh 23 which is essentially the mayor's proposal and what that does is highlight for for for you all the issues that we are seeking uh feedback on uh the the proposal uh obviously looks at the the balancing act that uh has been conducted but also looks at water use a much more focused debate on water use I think last last year with the annual plan we got caught up in a in an unfortunate process which made it look as if we had we were allowing people who had more expensive properties to use more water and that was not the intention the intention uh is simply to identify households using more than 700 liters a day intention behind this is very much to get people focused on what they're using their water for is to focus attention on conservation and I think that I know that councillor kewan has raised it many many times about the extent of the difference between christchurch and its water use per household and in places like auckland and and wellington other places that have excess water charges or full water use um uh based uh base um rates utilization rates um the heritage area is something that uh I've particularly focused on but we've had a plea from the art center to to to ask the citizens of christchurch if they would contribute uh to the to the cost of getting the reinstatement of the buildings that they're working on at the moment completed and through a targeted rate it enables us to look at heritage when we're investing in those heritage buildings that once the work is completed then the the rate disappears so these are contained within the rates at the moment they pull out um and are time limited in that regard a precious piece of of land a real legacy opportunity but for for me it's been very much a focus on on not wanting to see the funds put into a program which can then be lifted out and put into other parts of the program it's actually to ring fence the support that's required for delivering on that water wastewater climate action solid waste and resource recovery facilities investing in parks rates borrowing government support social and economic recovery post covert 19 and a generic overview so I think the mayor's proposal gives us the basis for the debate um on the issues that we might want to raise today but as I say there's a whole several months where we are receiving or weeks where we're receiving feedback from our communities and then there are the hearings of the submissions different engagement opportunities with the public and and then finally decisions to be made in june so it's it's a process that we're we're really kicking off the public part of today so I'd like to invite of us today obviously there are requirements under the local government act that we need to meet and uh I'd be very grateful I'm not sure whether it's dai or peter that's um introducing the report today peter said die and I said peter so good morning um look the chief executive has asked me to spend a few moments at the beginning of this to frame where we've come from it's just a good way to understand the depth of the process we followed here this ltp actually began 18 months ago in september of 2019 which feels like a hell of a long time ago it began with the mayor councillor's letter of expectation which set out a very clear framework for what was expected the bottom line of that was transparency accountability and a good balance now that balance feature we didn't understand at the time was going to be tougher than it sounded because we didn't know about covert we didn't know about two annual plans we didn't know about the airport dividends we but construction began and it was the fact that we started early and much earlier than we ever have before that meant that when we hit covert and lockdowns staff were in a position to keep working which they they did um right through the whole lockdown period the activity plans asset plans and so forth were being built that meant that by the middle of next year when we started to get our heads around what covert meant that we actually had a draft ltp to deal with not everything was there but much of it was the bottom line of that level of preparation meant that you did get to see every budget every level of service you got to go through the capital program at nauseum at infinitum to get it right where you wanted it the situation was evolving as we watched the ltp evolve so there's a degree of um flexibility right to the end of where we got to um the end result is that you're seeing stuff you've never seen before for example the asset plans have never been through before there have been a lot of adjustments and reductions uh to the volume of levels of service so they're clearer you've had greater transparency around the asset plans and activity plans than ever before where we find ourselves is in an unusual place in that for the past decade we've been dealing largely with looking back at earthquake impacts this ltp doesn't really do that it looks forward but it's created a we're an unusual set of circumstances whereby the big projects of the city are committed to they've been consulted upon with both the crown and the public so things like metro sports are already there and other things are already committed to as well either by deliberate choice or by necessity we must renew our assets according to the guidelines the instruction from council was to protect core levels of service especially around things like roading and two waters three waters so they're things that can't_''_471.36 be compromised we have money from the crown for roading and water and we're not going to look at a gift use that money wisely so in other words there are a lot of things that we are in the must-do space uh but equally the financial prudence guidelines around how we handle our financials and the head room we leave ourselves for to deal with another event should one occur and our debt levels and so forth they haven't moved which means that our financial position and parameters are heavily committed the things we're going to go and build are heavily committed we actually have less room in this ltp for uh freedom of choice than than many people might imagine and that I mention that because it frames what you see in the consultation document so that's that's how we got here we are still working with audit new zealand on the consultation document to get some of the very fine points around that sorted you received a new copy yesterday that has been updated just very quickly as I mentioned earlier today the changes you've seen to that document from the one released in the first report to put a very clear summary the reader with the things we didn't put in our proposed approach to the ltp and why and how they work and what the negative consequences of those things would be so that if they disagree with the council's proposal they can make an informed decision about what they would like to see done differently and what those options were and why council didn't use them so they they can make an informed submission to council about what we didn't put in our proposal as much as what that we did as well as that we've made some other changes to the cd to bring it closer into line to what audit's looking for so that's the the task in front of council today um I will say that I haven't seen in any of the ltp since 2005 when effectively when they began in new zealand um the level two of detail to which both opex and capex have been worked through by the councillors and by staff there's been about a hundred hours of counsellor time devoted to mostly of it may have seemed a bit painful repetitive but what it means is the council has arrived at a proposal which given the loss of dividends from the airport and the impacts of covert has delivered a rates figure that compares favorably with a lot of councils delivers a capital program which is almost at the absolute capacity of what we can meaningfully build we don't want to plan for something we know we can't deliver has protected core levels of service has preserved the head room we need in the event of another crisis and has kept our debt levels prudent so that's the the optimum position the sweet spot whatever you want to call it and that's what we're putting out in the staff and counsellor recommended proposal so that's really the summary of how we got here and what we've got to are there questions for staff sarah I know that you had a question thank you um I've got a couple of small bits from there but I'll just go back um to what you were that during the annual plan last year we we made sort of the 18 million dollars worth of operational savings and deferred a whole pile of capital um we've lost dividends we had to borrow more to cover shortfall from our facilities those kind of things what position would we have been and had it not been recovered like what if we if we'd still bring in the same dividends made the same sort of savings that we'd made in the annual plan long-term plan where would we be at um thank you council I've got um bruce is just looking up that detail of that email that he sent to you yeah so I'll ask him to join us here at the table I i don't think we can easily answer that question um the because there were a number of things we did as a response to covet and the question would be would we have done those things would we have gone to cchl and asked for more dividend if we hadn't had covered and yeah but so but the had if we had had the same sort of dividends and we hadn't had to borrow the money for our facilities but we had gone through the same process that we have had this time and made the significant amount of savings um and deferred capital do we have an idea where that might have put us well certainly certainly if we hadn't lost so much dividend the the rates increases would have been lower uh that may well have just been a effectively rate increases that have been brought forward that would have been incurred in later years will be part of the answer so some of the rate increases out and probably 25 26 have come forward because of covert but there would also be some probably some permanent um we I you know I'd be guessing but we we could have been looking at a three or four percent rate increase this year rather than five and a half okay yeah thanks um and just there's a couple of small things the um the sustainability grant the sustainability fund there's a line and sustainability fund which was the old name completely gone the consultation document has 380 000 for the sustainability fund but it's not showing in the grants and funds section no it was was 400 000 and it was funded from the capital endowment fund which was why it was showing lower down it's it continues it's it's taken a five percent haircut so it's at 380 000 and it goes through till 2025. it is there but it's currently caught up in the strengthening showing it's showing in the um contestable strengthening communities grants line but that will be pulled out separately for those yes separately we've simply bundled it up into that top line and we should have kept it separate and the heritage one includes intangibles so we'll be able to list those ones separately because we do biodiversity of 190 000 which goes right across all ten years there's also in that strengthening community design we'll separate that out them all out yeah that's great thank you I've got uh yani then sam money that's been put on for the stadium amenity it's not it's not been called out in any way that people can understand it I think it's about 25 million why have we not explicitly highlighted that I'm not sure what the right answer is there except that possibly is it something we've consulted upon already no no it's new money um in the tens of millions I think it's about 25 or 26 million um and it's in to enhance the streets around the stadium so apparently it's not part of the stadium project but it's additional spend it's significant and it just seems weird that it's not highlighted as something that people should be aware of well that's certainly something we can have a look at okay um just the other question I had was really in some of the um report particularly on on page 20 of the introduction it makes reference to the organics plant um upgrading in response to complaints but I think we actually need to be a lot more of contract by the operator who's responsible for meeting the consent and therefore we have a legal requirement to respond to ecan so I just wondered if that section can be amended to be very explicit that actually it's not about the complaints the complaints actually um have been there but actually it's about the fact that actually the complaints have been substantiated by the regular regulatory authority which requires us to take action yeah this is in the mayor's proposal and I think yanI's raised a good point so I i would like the words to be you know sort of accurately describe what um happened so not that we're doing this in response to complaints that that we we did this in response to action you know or notice notice from ecan uh so we just need the correct words that are placed in there and I know that subsequent to us making the decision uh an abatement notice was served in order to ensure that we were um delivering on uh on that so even with the subsequent reference with the think would satisfy um yanI's concern is that right yep understood yeah thank you I just oh sorry I just had two more questions two more one was um in regards to the capital acceleration fund I'm kind of trying to understand like in terms of the plan we're highlighting that we're going to do it but it's not really up for submissions is it we've got a separate process underway which kind of surprised me why we've got a separate process to engage the community but in terms of the the ltp where we've highlighted the um those that that expenditure that's that's going to happen that's not up for change or there's no way we can amend that I'm not sure what you would consult what I'm what I'm concerned about is we're currently out asking people to go as a whole list of transport projects for the acceleration fund and if it comes back that we get I'm pretty sure we'll get more demand than what we've got result of that well I'd have to defer to the transport planners but I can't imagine a situation in which we wouldn't make changes based on feedback except it's a separate process that's ahead of the ltp yes but the ltp doesn't um spell out every project that we're going to do under craft okay yep um and then finally I just was in terms of the water charging proposal is there a way that the public submitters people that are interested in the issue can contact council now and get how much their average data use is no that information is not currently available so I know we've been doing some meter readings but I'm concerned that for people to make an informed submission unless they know what the impact is on them it's quite hard to say whether it's something that you support or have concerns about because you don't you simply don't know when would we be in a position to advise people what the latest meter readings have been of their water use top of my head firstly the meter would have to be accurate and secondly someone would need to read it calculate the difference and go back to the people um so we need to find out from the water team what can can I just raise that as one thing that I think I mean because I know we've been doing the quarterly meta readings um but yeah thanks but if I can just say a reading for one quarter is not necessarily indicative of whether you're going to uh whether your water consumption is um above the 700 liters a day because it's expected to only apply in the summer fix it well as I understand it what they do is it's the quarterly um average use that they take into account so people would still know like for the last three months for example yes but each quarter isn't necessarily indicative of the next quarter no no I understand that but at least where we've already done meter readings it's we're not doing it on an annual basis we're would still be able to see for the last three months over summer for this particular period anyway that what they were using which I suspect this period is probably one of the periods of high demand we'll work with helen to understand what can be done in that space yeah and come back to you thanks cool uh sam cool um thank you team for this uh just two really quick ones um firstly in diet's probably a question for you around the capital program did the I mean I know there's a proposal there of a level of spend did the staff have a particular view on what that level should be so I'm just trying to gauge the difference between I guess the prudent level that staff would put forward as opposed to what we've landed on by majority we our initial initial recommendation for the council charge but was around 400 million we then recommended something slightly lower our our key recommendations 375 but after working with the capital group and looking at our longer term projection we felt we could're still maintaining our 400 million headroom in all but two years when which is around the time of the stadium being delivered which was the key period we're working through so we have managed by other means to sort of get ourselves through that with minimal risk to the council right okay cool thank you and just the other one was around the heritage ground or the heritage targeted raid um do we have a figure on what that would be if it was just a and it doesn't have to be now even if I just get it later on what the if it was a flat charge across the city what that would be per household as opposed to the capital value charge oh we could get that yes yeah could I get that at some stage thanks cool thank you thank you uh jimmy and then melanie one question on pages 67 consultation document proposed the rickshaw bus lunges to be close I remember this issue several years ago when the staff you know and also council approved this one there were two conditions central region area every day they have 3 000 people body buses in the central region area second is the main purpose you know to set up is the past the lunch is the kind of cut the traffic accountation and making the rules safer for petitions I'm concerned now in order because the if this past lunch has been closed whether these the two you know the issue concern will be happen if happen how to mitigate this effect it is my concept because totally different from the several years ago in that kind of criteria I'm not sure how we can respond other than to ask richard to address your concerns there and explain a little bit more of the rationale behind what they're doing I can't talk to the technicals of the lounge decision myself off the hip but we can ask richard osborne to to come back to you on that thank you melanie um these are around the um excess water charge um one I was just wondering if we could include the median value of all the volume of water that would be helpful do we I still think it will be useful um and um the other one is about the exemption so there's two exemptions included and we may discuss this as well but I don't recall because it doesn't mention about exemptions for large households so can we include that as one of the we've just got exemptions for the water leaks and medical purpose use uh we might need to clarify here diane's just mentioned that she doesn't recall the exemption for large households so I'm we talked about it was in last year's annual plan and we have always talked about it okay I think we need to clarify this just to figure out where things are at I've also written that down in my nights and we've talked about this too no no I i don't don't doubt that I'm just wondering what the difference is between your notes and and what we've got so I need to clarify that it's the ability to um to intervene isn't't an automatic that's correct no but it would be nice to have a spout out here I think right yeah okay so so it's just the wording that you want to see I would like a third bullet point so it's page 31 32. there would be some exemptions to the charge such as and to include um large households or whatever the wording was we had last time may I just ask how how do you define large please well maybe that's something we need to discuss but it wasn't the same as what we had last year more than two no more than small so the counselor is correct in her recollection both in terms of annual plan two and the discussion so uh I'm just carolyn it's important that helen and richard because these are areas of specific technical question they need to be in the room to be able to remind members okay does it just say right including well it's got there would be some exemptions to the charge such as unexpected high use due to um but you could you could just put exceptionally large households you know I mean it's it's it's going to be the exception we're not yeah yeah because with this this is 700 um liters which is well over the average so all right but I i don't I don't object to that going into the into the um into the documentation it was what we discussed you're right pauline thank you and then jay mine's just a wording issue as well on the organics processing plant and it's relating to the expenditure over the next 10 years and it's but it's convoluted with the move so the paragraph that reads the first three years will focus on the upgrades at the organics processing plant and materials recovery facilities sites so I think we should probably make it a little bit clearer that we're intending to upgrade the organics processing plant by january 2022 and the rest of the money will be obviously on the move so if we could just differentiate between the upgrade time frame I upset about that thank you we can definitely make that clearer jake um yeah so a suggestion or a question um given that our auditors had some some sort of hiccups with that we weren't presenting enough options in terms of you know from the things we discussed and break things um uniform annual general charges and then rolling those flat taxes back into progressive tax was something we discussed and were presented with four different options on have you thought of including that in the consultation documents so people could sum that I mean that's a proposal that would reduce the rates of I think 87 of christchurch residential rate payers no we didn't because when we presented it the consensus around the room was not to proceed and so we didn't we should present some more options though just signaling that that's an amendment I'd like to deal with maybe not today but certainly before the fourth well we're hoping that we can get things on the table today but I did note a question sam asked before and and I um because I mean it is an item that we could structure a debate around today um which is uh do we um well it's one end of the spectrum remove all of the uniform annual general charging that we have um it's it's at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of what's around the country but it's it is where it is um but it does have an impact uh and but the other question is is you know should there be other elements that are added to the uniform annual general charge you know we we have the um the uh waste levy we have a um uh twenty dollars I think it is for active transport is it still is um and then but but then the heritage one I i mean I am interested in the question that sam asked which was how much would that be if it were a flat charge across the city I personally um would favor that so um it looks like that that could be something that could be carved up as an could pick up a broader issue which is could the heritage one be looked at as a flat rate as opposed to related to the uh capital value sounds great as long as there's some lead room is leeway I should say for people to discuss the issue I think that's more than can I just say if we were in order for councils to be able to um debate that issue of um removing uag there would be quite a we'd need a bit of time to recalculate what the rates are yeah otherwise um councils would be trying to debate something without the information no no I understand that and that will take I'll need to check but they would take a little while as in but we could potentially debate it this afternoon um potentially but I'll have to go away and check right but anyway we're not saying that we're definitely going to do that today but um let's let's just um work out what that would would require and I remind you that you do have yeah um andrew thank you um so just on that issue if we were going to go to that debate we need to remember that it isn't just black and white we need to provide for some shades of grey in between as well um not necessarily on the heritage one but certainly on the matter that jake's raised yes yeah all right thank you the matter that I wanted to raise though and by way of a question in the cd under the heading service desks that highlights quite clearly there the proposal to close the littleton and accora service desks based on low levels of transactions and that's made clear in the document as well what are we referring to as transactions in that regard is it just financial transactions uh again I can't answer off the hip uh that level of detail but uh we certainly can investigate the the spreadsheet behind it and try and find out what what a transaction is yeah if it's strictly a financial one or or does it cover inquiries for example yeah I think we will be some interest in in those local communities I think we need to be clear um so if it is financial transactions my suggestion would be that we should say low level of financial transactions um or if it's wider than that then you know maybe we need to make that clear um second question relating so if we can have clarification on that that would be great second I'm sorry to interrupt you I'm just wondering if mary is able to answer that question for you yeah so we're proposing to close the service desk of zacaroa and littleton and it states pretty clearly in the cd um that that's because of a low level of transactions is that just financial transactions that we're referring to when we say that it's mainly the financial transactions because they're the ones that people tend to use the service centre for more but it isn't it's also the low level of foot count as well so it's both financial transactions and foot count into the into those service centers all it'll be useful for the local community to know that when they you know decide what they think about this that's good um so second question relating to the same thing that's called out well in the consultation document it's very very clear it isn't called out on the level of service in the activities and services statement of service provision tables I mean I guess the argument for that could be that it's in line with the provision of seven to thirteen hubs which is the level of service but the level of service provision over the previous two periods referred to in that table um is 12 hubs so there may not be a difference in the target level of service but there is a difference in the level of service proposed to be provided should that not be called out in that table as well yeah that's clear enough uh so yeah we could definitely look at just adding a point of clarification there that while technically it might be met it's not the same yeah it's a so if we can add that in I just would hate to think that people had gone looking through parts of the document and didn't see it and didn't see it in the cd and therefore didn't realize it was happening fair enough thank you yani another question just a few additional questions I just checked on that stadium support package and we were originally advised and the project sheet was 25 million but on the capital program it's only listed as five so I don't know whether that's an error or whether money's been reduced um so I just thought that might be helpful there's also just a bit more clarity on that there's a number of um water supply renewals there are about um eight million dollars so again like total cost of the stadium or the multi-use arena sorry um it would be really good just to highlight what the actual cost is um and I just was going to check on the property disposal process because we were told that it was you know going to be the yha we've we've had no information about that as best I can tell and yeah it's been listed to be sold the five worst districts so there's also a number on here that haven't been to the community board and one in particular which I know the board was our board was looking at which is on the list so I'm just trying to understand that property proposal disposal list how those things have been selected and why there hasn't been a sort of intermediary process where us for us to give that feedback first um and then I had one final question around the dc's but I'll just leave those two okay look on the property issue I think that maybe the best thing would be to ask bruce rendell to come right later in the day is it possible just to move an amendment to remove those well it might be better to have the discussion with bruce to understand how things got there okay cool um and so the development contributions policy as well like that's've got intensification happening no projects to compensate for the environmental and amenity loss of trees uh parks um that sort of thing or outdoor space we're kind of in a chicken and egg we're told if we don't have something on the ltp we can't charge development contributions but we haven't signed off on our development contribution policy so we don't know what projects um could go in there to deal the growth so the so I'm just trying to understand what the process is for us signing off on the development contributions policy and list of projects that do get dc's when we do that and also just want to be really clear and understand that um development contribution rebate you know the money that's going to subsidise the development in the central city when do we get a chance to um support that on budget or not we've had the development contributions policies going out for consultation which will make that redundant it will make it a redundant question due to the changes that are going to time frame have you got a time frame I believe that's coming on the 11th but I've just got an answer here from um on dc's that you can't charge dc for loss of amenity or streetscape improvement no but the idea was that for example take waltham which we've seen massive intensification and we don't have any capital projects to um you know cater for the growth and demand for for things like the playground I thought we could have a growth project related to the development to put in additional facilities in the area are you saying that we can't I'm saying you can't charge a development contribution on a loss of amenity right um but the policy is coming I believe it's the 11th of march that the policy is coming for discussion brendan brendan's nodding so that it will be here on the 11th of march so it will be in place in time for the the conclusion of the ltp only if we agree with it though because if it comes and it's quite quite a discussion point then it may not so yeah and sorry what I was talking about loss where you've got you know big houses that have trees in a backyard so it's going to go out for consultation we're not here to discuss the dc policy no the question is how do we add projects to cater for growth if we're not doing the dc's policy as part of this today well because it's been developed in conjunction with this and it's coming in two weeks so then that will amend the capital that can amend the capital program if it's not already there then yes you could make that change brandon would you like to come up to the table just while that's happening I should point out the dcp is no longer part of the long-term plan it's run separately the legislation broke it out in order to deal with just this timing issue so it is actually a separate but parallel thing with overlap not part of the ltp I think the answer to your ltp those components of the capital program that under the legislation um can be linked back to legitimate dc charges uh included so if you wanted to add projects the time and the place to do it would be to add projects to the council's capital program not via the dc policy per se so you're adopting the draft capital program as part of adopting the draft ltp and uh that goes out for public consultation and and you'll undoubtedly get feedback on that and then you adopt the final ltp which includes the final capital program the dc policy will be finalized shortly after the council adopts the final capital programme so it will adopt the final capital program at the end of june this year in the dc policy will come shortly thereafter which will then reflect the capital program that the council has adopted right does that make sense so the mechanism is via the capital program that you're adopting at a higher level the principle of where we've got traditionally the um the areas uh that are having huge intensification um we've got you know massive development happening like waltham um the principle around our dc's policy which I thought we had asked for work to be done around how do you have projects like growth projects to cater for the increase in people that can be done as part of the capital program is what you're saying uh if you wanted to add projects to create a new playground or a new open space or something like that then the place to do it is to add that project as part of the capital program it's a second order question about whether that project can be funded via dc's though the legislation is very specific about what can be found exactly so it can't_''_2527.92 be funded by dc's and I don't think we'll get support from the council table your example of trees being taken from someone's backyard through intensification that can't_''_2538.16 be funded via dc's no but yeah we have strategic lamp we used to have a reserves budget where when new development happened money went in things that were happening so I mean I know everything's changed but that's right I'll wait for the dc's policy amendments to the capital program based on on that by the time we sign off on this uh so just to be clear the if you wanted to add capital projects then the mechanism is probably via the capital program that you're doing as part of either the drafting of the ldp or the final ltp and you can't add capital projects at the time of adopting the dc policy no and so can I can I suggest that the appropriate time will be you know during the course of the um of the ltp process um prior to the final um ltp being adopted if there are any additional capital projects that need to be put in in that time then that's the appropriate time to do it rather than amend something without any background information at the front end um the point is when we um I don't know if councils maybe the new ones we've never seen it actually get a schedule of projects broken down by how much they qualify for development um contributions versus the general rate and so it's actually a really good way of seeing what what kind of qualifies for growth and what doesn't and how it's funded and that's what I was expecting to get as part of the dc's policy thing that we we sign off yeah and that list is taken from the capital program that council adopts the draft and that's exactly why we don't finalize the dc policy until after the final capital program is addicted at the end so what I'll do I'll put forward some projects ahead of that dc being done and if we can get some assessment whether they meet the growth criteria in terms of dc's that would be helpful I mean prior to it being completed or or just prior to the 11th of march for consideration well I think are they do we need to consider are they already on our capital program no they won't be okay it needs all right uh bruce would you like to come forward and answer yanI's other question and I missed it yani so can you ask it again so I was just concerned that some of the properties on the disposal list are um quite well one's quite significant which is five forced to boulevard yeah um I don't we may have got a mirror but I don't recall getting anything about the yha the last we provided guidance on that it would just be included in the list who did it it was on it's been on the list right from the first time we saw it yha five-year-old_''_2722.8 sunny if we ralston sorry so what's the process to go through the community boards as well so just before you do bruce I will remind councillor that we did have a full briefing on the process before christmas which is why we took a report to council on exactly how the community boards would be engaged can you give him the detail again please yep um so there's a set of criteria that is um that we then circulate that list so this has been to community boards uh in an informal basis so that they can then consider that as part of their submission to the uh long-term plan it's also gone to another number of other key stakeholders such as uh some of the housing providers uh knowing that there's uh interest in housing to manafenou as well and then submissions are made and council gets to consider uh the final um this make the final decision through the long-term plan when decisions can be made both financially as well as whether or not we need the land for any strategic purpose good are there any other questions for staff uh aaron yeah I i have a couple one is um on the land drainage targeted rate and it's the switch from the people that are not paying I've just done a skim over a whole lot of properties across the city seems everyone pays it and it's got a thing there there will be a link to a map but who is being added into that rural properties those in banks peninsula and there are areas of the city within the outer suburbs who are not currently paying those are the key properties being added right there's hardly any in total isn't a number of properties well there's more than you would have hoped for which is why we want to tidy it up and get it fixed right okay um so that's that one and then the other one is um around the transport one uh it's got uh for the buses the spending of we put in 96.7 million for bus infrastructure over the next 10 years and the do we have uh an outcome of target numbers like what will be the um the net saving of carbon for spending that amount of money that doesn't seem to be in there anywhere it doesn't say where we get to uh look at sometimes I know there'll be a 40 increase in bus usage was the number richard osmond gave us which so that takes you from 2.2 to 3 of people's trips being on our emissions which from transport are 36 percent um look I wish uh richard were here but I i do have to take a punt at something here which is there is a line between what council's responsible for and what other agencies do and we're responsible for the infrastructure yes we're not necessarily responsible for that we aren't responsible for how many people do or don't use the bus service or the carbon impact of that and the ltp the points been made to us from both within by councillors and by audit needs to be very clear about we do what we what we control and we don't build in targets around things that we don't control so we must be signing up to I mean because we declared a climate emergency so you can't have an emergency and then not have net targets that you must get to because if 36 of our emissions come from transport we must be going we'll lower it by this this and this which must have net targets in it especially spending'm not trying to be bureaucratic about it so much as saying that I think your concern needs to be in the right place which is maybe at the level of strategic directions rather than a level of service which is we contract to deliver x amount as a council of things that we don't actually control but should that those numbers that were in those strategic directions with all the various agencies should that not be in here when we're spending that much money I believe that some of that is in the strategic directions um but it's not in the levels of service which I'm saying it's about where it is rather than than the need for it um but I thought there were uh quite a lot of goals because you yeah you spend a dollar get 10 cents back not a great investment spend a dollar get eight dollars back great investment because the other one is the and it's the same question again as the cycleways are in here for an extra 235.8 million dollars and once again it like the reduction from that like at the end of that 10 years we can go we will we're currently there we will we will be there because that's why we're spending quarter of a billion dollars again I think it's about where where that information is the climate change strategy is going out we've got the strategic directions I believe that that kind of global ambition for the city probably sits there rather than as a level of service for staff to deliver but to get the public buy-in they've got to see miserable so they know that when we do this this and this we get to there it's like does that make sense it does um but I look I don't want to repeat myself too much I think it has to be in the right in the right place those goals and the data around them very properly belong in things like the climate change strategy the strategic directions the measures around the strategic directions but if you provide them to staff as a level of service in and so forth fueled you're at the wrong level if you know what I mean I I'd be welcome welcoming anybody else who wants to change but we shouldn't be spending quarter of a billion dollars without seeing the outcomes of the measurable outcomes of of that spend like every year that I i could get the number off the health board but there's a number of people that die from respiratory related illnesses in christchurch due to our air pollution so this is imminent this isn't in 50 or 100 years time people die every year so we need to uh this is a health issue as much as it's a climate issue and we should have the measurable outcomes to say in 10 years time because of these actions this many less people died but also we've done this for the planet no I i understand but outcomes outcomes normally go in things like the community outcomes the strategic directions the climate change strategies where big global outcomes for the city tend to rest so I'm just talking about the the public won't see that when they make submissions on it because we're getting we're going to get quarter of our submissions will be people coming in talking about climate change that's it's that's the environment we're living in and so they should be able to see measurable so they go no I want you to spend more there and less there because that is what they want but we must be able to measure it you can't just say climate change you've got to actually do something yeah the climate change strategy has been dealt with in parallel so I think that's a bit of a difficulty in one sense because it's so how does that have the outcomes of where we get to for each dollar spent because there's people who work for the un that do that that tell you every dollar wherever you spend it will tell you what your outcomes will be like all these numbers exist can I maybe clarify something if you if you build cycleways you expect an impact there whether it's working in say community outcomes or the climate change strategy or whatever and saying we measure this and we're testing whether it worked or not because building the cycle way doesn't guarantee that you will get the people you want no but you can test that by measuring it but there's a big difference between measuring it and placing it on staff as a target which is what a level of service does one is a piece of intelligence that tells you your investment is paying off or not the other one is a task you're placing on staff to deliver and I'm not sure that staff can deliver reduction in carbon through cycleways they build them they don't guarantee yeah I mean it's the same thing there are statutory um levels of service that are imposed on councils throughout the country which the staff cannot deliver they can't deliver them alone um because it is a combination of effect so that um there is there anyone else got an alarm bell going off there's a target on we contribute to by building safe roads by having education programs in schools by doing a variety of things having cycleways that even contributes to the number of deaths on roads um reduction yeah yeah so but you know in terms of people feeling safe about being on the road and and being safe on the road so so that they all contribute but they don't they don't enable staff to deliver the levels of service I mean we our target should be zero but it's not the statutory target that's given to the staff of every council in the country so you know I mean I understand what peter's saying and I understand what you're saying the the the measurable should be in the implementation plan that sits around the climate change strategy yeah because it should come down to the public should be feeding back especially the ones that are right into it should be feeding back on no spend more money there because we get a lot better bang for buck than spending it over here like in my walls you but it's coming to sarah's committee shortly so perhaps sarah would you like to just comment on it well I was actually I was going to ask um if the approach that aaron's suggesting where we have a dollar for you know banky but kind of approach when we look at the ltp is a similar approach to we've taken to for example a similar level of investment in the stadium so do we know for every dollar no that's a no I'm just what I'm trying to do is to guide people helpfully into um a situation where um and it's kind of picking up on what peter's saying is that the staff aren't responsible for the I know sorry please what would be really helpful is if we could see our way clear to um isolating where that information should be held and where those measures should be able to be found and it seems to me that the climate change strategy with its implementation plan should actually be the place where we can see those measurable reductions level documents coming to the committee tomorrow within it there is the zero emission transport plan which will have all the information there is a there is a transport plan working group led by councillor davidson that's working on all of that sort of stuff at the moment there are expressions of interest you could be coming along to the meetings you'll be able to see all the data about all of those kind of things um those meetings um are open to any counsellor to turn up to um and yeah so I mean all the information is around yeah nzta has all of those cost benefits trying to do we had a business case on the cycleways what aaron was trying to do helpfully was to um to to daylight the issue and the context of the spend except that I'm just going to say that if you're only isolating one project for that concept of spend and not saying we should be doing it for all projects then then there's a disparity but we do do it I misunderstood aaron say that mentioning I think he was looking at a number of projects in the public the public yeah so the sustainable transport system is on the working group for the transport plan so I hope he stays bold during that process too absolutely yeah anyway so um I i would like to think that um yeah I the the the way that I think that it would be helpful to to to address the issue is um to see how much of the uh that will the engagement that we have on the climate change strategy is able to draw that information out into the public arena because I think by the time we get to the ltp because the the consultation will be will be completed on the on the climate change strategy before we conclude the ltp so we should be in a position by the time we get to the final set of decisions on the ltp to be able to have a really clear understanding of what the investment and a whole range of different projects will do in order to achieve the uh carbon reductions that we're not responsible for the for whole of them which is um why we've we've set a a target of 2025 but it's only a an aspirational target for the city because we don't simply control all of the different aspects of the city uh that would enable us to achieve that and from a council point of view 2030 and we need to see measurable and deliverable and delivering results as we get to 2030 so and I'm hoping that that's what the climate change strategy will help us um to address but it does need to be as you say wrapped into the final leg of this process so that they all come together and people can see that their investment in the capital program is producing the climate action that we want them to produce yeah sarah obviously adam if you want some data so the average kiwi drives 10 000 kilometers a year um and that's two tonnes co2 no aaron was asking for specific information it's two tons of co2 for every 10 000k you bike yeah thank you oh they had a service I am trying to be helpful to people to raise these issues but are there any other issues generally because I'm I might um I might move on to the next next little item people generally done with questions um madam chair um helen's here she may be able to answer yanI's question about water meter readings hello and helen can you also touch on the issue of large families because it needs to be included in the documentation yes I've got notes on um two or three things that have come up so if if it helps if I just go over those to start with so um just a reminder because it's some time since we had our workshop talking about water charging so the allowance is 700 liters per day assessed quarterly okay so not over a year as we did in the annual plan proposal that's assessed quarterly so if you go over your average of 700 liters per day in any one quarter then you're liable for a bill for per household per day which is an average use and remember that average use includes ordinary household use and garden watering which is a favorite activity here in christchurch in the garden city so it includes that garden watering with no no controls on it if you like a reminder that quarterly so we are reading meters quarterly that doesn't mean that we're going to read a quarter of the city on the 1st of march and then a quarter of the city on the 1st of june and then a quarter on the 1st of september they will be rolling reads around the city so you'll get your meter read not not exactly every 91 days but usually between 80 and 100 days and it will be averaged over that period all right so that's a quarterly reading and a rolling reading across the city in terms of getting information out to households we've started those quarterly readings already so we're starting to get that information together and we will be sending notices out to people so they know how much they've that they use a relatively small amount in the winter and if they're very keen on their use of water outdoors for gardens or swimming pools and for such they will see their use go up in the summer okay so we will get that information out to people on a rolling basis we're also working on an app where they can get they can draw that information from us rather than us send it out now that that is a work in progress and there's no guarantee we'll get that up and running in time and in fact there's no guarantee we'll get it up and running at all because we just need to check with legal about whether that information is considered private okay so there's a bit to work through there but that would that would be the best actually that people can just assess it themselves in terms of the first bill nobody would get a bill until the first summer so that's the summer of 2022. so if council after hearing submissions adopts this then the ordinary to be low and within the allowance for a house a household and they wouldn't get a bill until the summer if they did get a bill earlier than that it's more likely that it's a leak and that's one of our exemption provisions so if you've got an undetected leak on property and that's leading you to use you know 2 000 liters per day and you provide evidence that you've fixed that leak then you can get an exemption from that unexpected and ridiculous water bill all right so we will address households the household side of the meter leaks through this process as well so remember that that exemption um and the final thing people were asking about large families we do not have an exemption for large families which we did have under the annual plan proposal and that's because the 700 liters per day is more than sufficient for ordinary household use even for large families so 700 liters per day is a lot of water and we expect that large families will be able to function medical purposes however again we don't expect we'll ever have to use it but 700 liters per day is again a lot of water and should provide for that so the only one that's specifically there is for leaks unexpected leaks on proof that you've fixed them so that's that's the quick summary and there are any other medical purposes and medical use yeah yeah um I've got sarah melanie yani thank you um the other one that we had last time and I've had a quick answer back just now was around um community uses for water so we have several places around many places around the city where we have council reserve land where we're doing native plantings or there's a community garden next door on council with land where the private residence is allowing their tap to be used to help water the natives growing in drayton reserve for example or or at a community garden and they community activities that are of benefit to council and to the wider community but it's an individual tap spec we did put this in last time a specific exemption we would be able to use for people doing that so that we have significant amount of council what we would prefer to plant is to give them their own supply so if they're on a separate title to that household that's letting them use their outside tech but it's a councilwoman yeah we would prefer that they had their own supply if it's on a piece of council land so parks and reserves for example usually have their own supply so they're separately metered yeah they often don't have as the play at all what we would prefer to do is to give them their own supplies so they should come and talk to us and we'll get their uh their own supply point put in otherwise that household we have no way of monitoring that household's use if yeah there's very very few of them across the city it seems like it'll be easier just to exempt those properties than it would be easier for us to it's relatively simple to do that okay we might get super news and parks advice on that maybe just in the next hour or so yesterday thanks melanie I mean sorry to stop I will keep hiking back to last year in the annual plan but is it true we had um we were going to we were talking about an excess water charge for over 915 litres per day and I realised that if people's rates were low we were going to be charging them earlier on than those with higher rates but we also had the large families included so it doesn't quite add up to me so we've done some more work on patterns of use and the pattern the high users are those with large gardens and irrigations or undetected leaks there's very little correlation there is some correlation with family size but it doesn't it doesn't push it over the 700 liters per day there's no harm in including um you know extra large households is there because there's no harm in it because as you might never need it well what I would need to be very clear on is what do you mean by a large household so if it's um a flat for example with 12 people and they've all got their own ensuites and there are some of those sort of workers accommodation is that a large household yeah or should we be charging them for the additional water that they're using you have to call it a family yeah well that's that's once you start getting into an exemption like that you start getting into a whole lot of questions about how you um how you manage and monitor that exemption this is only if they get a bill over 700 yes and there are there are a large number of um very large properties with multiple occupants which are sort of like boarding houses workers accommodation which do get billed now under the commercial use um well and some do and some of them are residential and wouldn't get built so we'd have to we'd have to have a look at that um per person 234.8 liters a day average if you had six kids and two adults they could use up to sixteen sixteen hundred no that's not correct so the averages are misleading so that average per person is taking the average household use and then the average number of people in a household so the average six-person household doesn't use six times the average one-person household quite obviously um there are lots of um different things going on in any one household so it's not it's not reasonable to multiply the average single person used by six for a six person household it's not how it works well that's very helpful information actually so so just to uh not to cheese my very excellent officer off but clearly it is your prerogative if you wish to see something added to the annual plan in terms of exceptions and then you would task us with a way to achieve that to make sure it would work but it may be that we need more detailed information than the cd itself which describes what the case there is a case where it is actually applied if we don't include it we can't do it and it will be unfair but isn't there what about allowing for a discretion that enables staff to um consider a situation like that which is actually what I thought we could put in a we could put in a discretionary one if you like which would be um around large families and financial hardship or medical grounds or so yeah one single discretionary clause if you like I would recommend you do that yeah I think that solves the the problem and that and that would get over the um the sort of multiple worker accommodation can I just say financial hardship though is very hard to determine and if the remission allows staff or puts it on staff to make a decision then it's it's difficult to implement fairly so what how do you define financial hardship well I just think look I i I i don't actually want to have a debate around here as to um how to do that there allow um you know hardship or an equity to to be a driver so let's say take it offline but you're getting a direction from us that we want uh the capacity for staff to be able to to to offer an exemption um you know where the where there are good reasons that sit in behind it you know size of the family um uh personal circumstances you know which includes the medical medical situation that you've described as well yeah uh yani oh yeah thanks I just wanted to check so when did we start doing the quarterly readings and when will we be in a position to have done all the quarterly readings across the city for the first time so we started quarterly readings late last year and those are rolling out across the city at the moment they're not universal at the moment and in some places we can't find the meters so there's a bit of there are a few teething problems running on did you ask when we would be able to send out information I'm when will someone know over the quarter what their use has been so people can read their meters today so we've got quite clear um directions and instructions on our website on how to read your own meters so if they want to do that they can they can do that just look on the website and go and do it yeah I understand that where will we be sending notices what I'm trying to understand is that the question yeah we started doing the quarterly reading at what point do we get an assessment of what the average daily use has been for the readings that we started at the end of last year so when will people know for formally from when could people find out formally from us if they wanted to what their average data use has been over the last quarter um they can find out today if they email and ask or phone up and ask not that I'm wanting 30 000 of them to phone up tomorrow what we would like to do is over the next three to six and we're putting that in place at the moment because we've got a new contract going out for meter reading right could it be done at the same time as the rates demand to save us on postage no because we've got a rolling program of readings so it's a different mechanism we're billing for on a rolling program of meter readings so just to just to confirm so I want to make sure that the message has landed the first time if you agree at the appropriate time in june that you're going to adopt this the first time the public will receive a bill is in summer 2022 that's correct for the vast majority of people that's the first time they'll receive a bill for the few people who have major leaks on their properties they may receive one almost immediately however if it's due to a major leak and they didn't know it was there and they fix it we'll give them an exemption but yes for the vast majority of people it will be just finish off that but we will be informing the public helen will we not from go forward what their usage has been on a quarterly basis before we get to summer 2022 to allow them to adjust their behavior yes so we'll give we'll what we'll do is let people know what their use has been whatever the frequency of the meter reads have been so some of them will have been quarterly for a year some of them may not for that be for that long but whatever readings we've got we'll let them know what their average uses from those readings yeah I just um so I think people will have plenty of information and time to adjust by the time it comes to hearing submissions if people are making submissions to us saying I'm really concerned about this proposal I'm going to be I'm worried I'm going to be charged examination z will people have a sense of what their average daily use has been over the last summer quarter that we're currently in yes they let them know and a number of people did that last time for the annual plan hearings and most of them didn't come and make a submission to you because most of them were within the allowance yeah right great and just so I'm really clear the entire city's quarterly meter reading from start with the first reading so this is the end of the quarter this is how much you've used the first one of those will be complete when we're doing quarterly read meter readings now so we're rolling them out across the city now so some people have already had maybe three readings most people will have had one or two sorry it's the second one really that's the key so the first one to work out what the current state is no well let's go back so we have been reading meters in this city ever since they went in but most residential ones only every two years some of them every one year so we already have data going back 10 15 years so it's it sorry just to be really clear the quarterly reading the first one we do we've done it yes then we do a second one so we can work out the average daily use for that time of the year yes yeah just to be really clear when in terms of the entire city will we have or you know recognizing there's a few exceptions but when will the first quarterly average results for an individual or a household be available they're available now yeah they're all available they're available so we've done two quarterly reading we've done two meter readings mostly recorded yes to everyone already great thank you right um do you want to just can I get for me can you just touch on uh the three water reform process because the consultation document you know alerts us to the or maybe it's not you um alerts us to the the bill but no no the three water reform process alerts us uh the the cd alerts everyone to the fact that the government's going through a process mean that we are likely to be uh going out to the community again before the end of the year with a consultation on on whether we buy into step two because it's an opt-out provision as what we're told it will be and that the bill that will establish all of that is likely to be introduced in may so it'll be before the end of the ltp so the ltp the consultation document quite rightly informs the public that this process is going on um but one of the outcomes of that process may well be us going back out to count out to our communities um asking whether they um wish us to remain in or to opt out of the reform program yes so the water the water reform program is being run by central government and department of internal affairs is leading it and they as most people know have signaled that they wish to see water services that is uh water supply wastewater management and possibly storm water management moved to a regional delivery model so that when I say regional but yeah so four to eight delivery agencies across the country or possibly fewer so what they're doing at the moment is looking at what's required for the best outcomes for communities in terms of their water services and when we say the best outcomes for communities they're looking at all communities and again as you're probably quite familiar most people in large towns and cities have very good drinking water and wastewater services but quite a number of people in our much smaller rural towns and more village sized towns don't have good access to good water supply and wastewater management services and the outcomes for public health and for the environment have been very poor and particularly there are some particular incidents of course that people attention is drawn to so that that process in terms of what is required to do that across the country is running at the moment with some international assistance and this council and a lot of other councils have provided information on who we deliver water services to how we deliver those services in terms of the what the needs are for investment and that information is being considered across the country to look at the best delivery models um in parallel with that the the entities that deliver the water services are envisaged as standard standalone crown entities under their own um legislation so that is they are not council-controlled or council-owned entities and that the way that watercare is for example up in auckland which is entirely owned by the council and operated as a council controlled entity so these entities would be set up under their own legislation and have specialist boards so the boards would reflect the communities that they serve and also have specialist expertise in terms of managing and governing water services which is big business and specialist business so I think the important thing is in relation to this ltp both advice from solgum and from central government as to why the wording is what is in our current ltp and it will be outside of the decision timeline of this particular document we will be having to work as an authority as will every authority to come to its no later than the end of this calendar yeah because the legislation won't go in until I was about to say summer but I do mean winter I'm doing my northern hemisphere thing again so it will be outside this timeline and undoubtedly we will have to do the consultation process that's right and central government have flagged that they will put a lot of effort into engaging with communities and engaging with ewe on what is proposed in terms of the reform so they're not asking each individual council to to to do that themselves each individual council will do their own version of consultation and talking with their own communities but it'll be in that wider context so central government will provide a lot of information on the reform program and the reasons for it and what is proposed for national consistency but to be really clear this authority will remain responsible for the next three years for water which is the lifetime of this ltp that's correct yes um so you're not abdicating your any responsibility that's right and will do is ensure that the the process um works well for local government so if there need to be changes to the local government act or any other legislation to enable this to happen without um local government having to tie itself and knots around any transfer of assets or change in service levels then central government will look at that and make sure that the that the transition process works well for everybody and of course all members have been invited to the roadshows that are in march 23rd of march I think it is yes yes I mean I've just you know I i kind of I don't want to kind of frighten people but in terms of the numbers that are being talked about by central government in terms of the under investment and the infrastructure three waters infrastructure across the country between 27 billion and 46 billion dollars uh would lead to massive increases in um and and and the cost to household bills um and and they had I mean I've just got a document in front of me which which local authorities in new zealand were found to have been investing at a level below that needed to maintain the performance condition and risk profile of their assets except christchurch so christchurch has been signaled out singled out but I think that the part of the that has been the investment that was undertaken as a result of the earthquakes but I think that we collectively can take some credit for continuing to invest in our infrastructure I know that part of that has been driven off um the desire to return to uh chlorine-free status but I think that we're going to want advice from our officials as to what influence if if we were ultimately to end up with a an independent company running the the three waters are we will we be in a position to put in place some obligation to maintain the our commitment to uh safe drinking water that is also good to drink which means without that residual disinfection in place so that's the that's the level of advice that we're going to need to offer that kind of priorities are yeah and then and that is recognized by central government that local government is very keen on community involvement and community influence in the delivery of these services because they are they are you know important to communities so yes I think that's a strong feature of the submissions on the bill yeah um from across local government yeah I know that the the water services bill is coming to the finance and performance committee on um thursday and uh and I'm going to save some of my commentary for that occasion but you know there is the um the provision in there for the exemption which um uh you know which obviously we we want to be in a position not only to apply for ourselves but also uh to ensure that whatever structure is set up in the future that there is a clear understanding that residual disinfection isn't the um the panacea to the to the appropriate provision of safe drinking water which is our our our commitment but from a secure source um not requiring that so but anyway that's your name now oh look you know how could you forgive me hey look a lot of comment with regards to community but as we've seen with the rma the community has been um distanced from any ability to really have a true say and that's that process so I i think we need as a council and councils right through new zealand need really good and clear wording from central government how communities are going to be listened to and be able to be part of it and continue to be part of it that goes forward because I can see this when we say reform etc and it's used quite a lot with the rma it's about reducing the ability of communities and loading the councils local bodies tas whatever with the responsibility and being looked as the cooking board for um that reduce your reduction and ability to be to comment and I think that is a truly sad example of what central government's doing with the rma so I'd really that's for me and I think forever on this officers to the detailed debate you undoubtedly will have later on in the year on this matter but we are going to have to go out and consult on it because the provision that we are likely to be faced with is an opt-out provision and when you opt out what are the obligations that we're going to have to take on in order to maintain the level of standards that will be imposed also by the regulator yeah and that's what I'm saying when we go to consult we need to know what we're consulting on and we need that direction from central government yeah so if I can ask members to come back to the matter we are dealing with on the agenda would be really helpful thank you but it's connected it is connected because I think people do need to understand that um we are constrained in terms of what we're consulting on in relation to the three waters because there is this additional engagement that is being undertaken at a central government level but we are also taking forum we've instigated this work we have been in the position to provide the information that central government has asked for in order to inform the next stage of the process because I think we're we've been in a really um good position understanding our asset base and continuing to invest in our asset base in a way that's been um very useful so have we got any other questions or questions no so I have I don't have questions about water I have questions about just the for the comms team for katie so as can we move on to that or are we leanne can I ask that these are material to whether or not we accept the draft like we've spent 90 to 100 hours giving direction and fleshing this out and I think it's seriously worrying if we're at a point I'm just going to get to sam in a minute and he will present okay audit and risk fun well I think it's around whether you accept the draft you're comfortable with it and we are going to debate the um drugs this is what we're here to do thank you so much yeah katie and just um just the question you know the challenge is always um how do we engage meaningfully with our community about this document which is extensive and so just wondering if you could outline some of the strategies that you're going to use to gather the widest range of responses to this document when it's finally out in public and I know that you've listed some already but just it would be helpful to know how you're going to actually address things like english as a second language those communities who don't perhaps traditionally engage with us certainly so um we will be using all of our council channels to get the information out recognizing though that that doesn't reach everyone so we'll also be doing targeted a specific engagement with certain communities that we know are going to be harder to reach so we have some dates in the diary already with the youth sector and we will also rather than trying to set up our own we're we're hoping to dovetail them with other people's because we always get better attendance we will be that said we will be having a couple of drop-ins uh at turranga we'll be inviting the public to come along and we'll be looking at what we can do out in the community working with governance teams in the community boards to set up some events out out there we will be producing a um sort of like a a3 folded to a4 of information which is the summary of of the consultation document just to make it a little bit more accessible we'll be looking at how we translate certainly the call to action the fact that it is ltp time uh we probably won't be in a position to be able to um to uh translate um a huge amount of documentation but we will be making it very clear that it is the consultation time and we'll be working through our existing stakeholder database to sort of like leverage where we can have devised which we've tested with the community boards because that is brand new absolutely so we have a new tool this year which is the um which shows both our capital and operational expenditures so this is something that people can access online it's a level of um accessibility that we haven't had previously so previously you'll recall if you'd like to find out anything in our long-term plan you'll be looking through a 100 or so page pdf spreadsheet which is not not searchable you will be able to use this tool to be able to search out projects that will be able to be searched by ward by project title and we're hoping that's really going to make things a lot more accessible for people to find out information that answers the question my next question which is exactly that how do local people access their local information so what does that tool look like and how do people know about it so we'll be making sure that we're promoting that tool widely uh on all of to make people very very aware um the the resources available to them as part of this ltp consultation fantastic and what about um community board plans will that be the sort of the the task of the community board if they have those local drop-ins to have those plans there uh yes yes we'll be looking to community boards um for support on that thank you thanks very much so um and thank you to staff I'll now move on to the audit and risk management committee which met on friday the 19th to discuss the process and and I'd like to invite council mcdonald who's the deputy chair of the armc to present the committee's advice yeah sure uh thank you leanne um councillors there's a memo on the hub for everyone as well already which just talks through our process I guess the point of this like we talked about with the annual plan last year was the audit and risk role in this so it's not necessarily to offer a view on the content but it's a it to and whether we're comfortable with the approach that's been taken by management and counsellors through that so I think like I reiterated at the last one we haven't come away with a resolution that says we're happy with the rates increase or the level of borrowing or things like that but in fact actually that the steps we've taken as a council and with the management team to get there are comfortable so there's just three recommendations there which is obviously around noting it and then you know comfort over the process around management sign off and just the third one um I don't think it's up on the screen but it's really just around the consultation document um so obviously we had hoped to get that for friday at audit and risk um just as part of the context to do it but with the issues around um I guess how that's been managed by audit new zealand we've just uh just noted there that that's still to come so it hasn't affected our sign her team were working quite closely with audit new zealand to get that sorted so yeah there certainly weren't any flags from the committee on the day and uh kim wallace our independent chair uh you know went through it thoroughly with our independent members and does send her apologies for for today as well so there's nothing really else to add leanne if you're happy with that that's very good thank you so um with that can I um move the recommendations that we have on the um on the screen in front of us and we have and I'll just quickly run through them that we're receiving the information that's been contained and referred to in the staff report and the documents attached to it noting the recommendations of the council's audit and risk management committee adopting the information that provides the basis for the council's draft ltp and relied on by the content of the consultation document noting that the full version of the information can be found on the website adopts the mere proposed mia's proposal principle and this is in principle um because of the requirement to have a later meeting at which point the formal adoption will occur so that isn't a point to sort of re-litigate anything it's simply the formal adoption once we have the auditor general's report as required by section c 4 of the local government act authorizes the general manager of finance and commercial and the chairperson of audit and risk to make any non-material amendments to the documents and then approves the following process for consultation you've just heard from katie's that was very helpful consultation available to the public on the 12th of march this is now subject to when the um final sign off but this is the plan if the final sign-offs on the 4th the period for making submissions running through to the 18th of april and for people who wish to opportunities are then provided to present oral submissions and oral submissions being heard between the 3rd and the 19th of may and then all going well the council meeting and confirming and adopting the long-term plan on required um and I think that's the that's the full list so I'll move that and andrew will second it by faith it's a 2021 indian wednesday 2020 question oh very good pilgrim well done give that man a chocolate fish that's um that was very good if those time frames change do we just manage that or do we have to rescind that no just manage it that's um just can can we approve the following process for consultation um subject to dates being confirmed once the um at the point of formal adoption yeah yeah all right so that's been um sorry if you wish to debate the rating basis and move away from the uagc then that will actually impact on the financial data which and the financial strategy so um you would need to have that debate before you um adopt that nice staff support well I didn't have the amendment before the meeting so no I just I wondered whether it was going to be possible to do that within the time frame but it's end of the opportunity this is the draft um and I'm sure that there will be submissions that will come in on the on the subject and we will have the opportunity to debate that fully in the context of the final adoption of the ltp are people generally comfortable with that approach good so I'm going to adjourn for morning tea and we will reconvene at 11 30.
The process to begin which is um which is really to get uh our communities focused on the issues that we need feedback uh from them on so I'm I'm going to oh you're sorry and I've completely uh jumped ahead and and forgotten too as the chief executive just highlighted um take the apologies of which we have won for councillor daniel so I'd like to move that we accept that second to the sam mcdonald I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried and there are no declarations of interest um recorded so uh when we when we get to the um to the plan itself uh there are a number of issues that are highlighted and the recommendation that I want the um the meeting to adopt today is and and it enables us to actually consider all of the issues is set out on the agenda on page 17. what sorry not page 17 on page 13 to page uh 23 which is essentially the mayor's proposal and what that issues that we are seeking uh feedback on uh the the proposal uh obviously looks at the the balancing act that uh has been conducted but also looks at uh water use um a much more focused uh debate on water use I think last last year with the annual plan we got caught up in a in an unfortunate process which made it look as if we had we were allowing people who had more expensive properties to use more water and that was not the intention the intention uh is simply to identify households using more than 700 litres a day with the average household using 540 litres a day the intention behind this is very much to get people focused on what they're using their water for us to focus attention on conservation and I think that I know that counselor um has raised it many many times about the extent of the difference between christchurch and its water use per household and in places like auckland and and wellington other places that have excess water charges or full um uh water use based uh base I've particularly focused on but we've had a plea from the art center uh to um to to ask the citizens of christchurch if they would contribute to the to the cost of getting the reinstatement of the buildings that they're working on at the moment completed and through a targeted rate it enables us to look at heritage uh when we're investing in those heritage buildings that once the work is completed then the the rate disappears so these are contained within the rates at the moment they pull out um and are time limited in that regard the otakuro avon river corridor there is this is a precious piece of of land a real legacy opportunity but for for me it's been very much a focus on on not wanting to see the funds put into a program which can then be lifted out and put into other parts of the program it's actually to ring fence the support that's required for delivering on that water waste water climate action solid waste and resource recovery facilities investing in parks rates borrowing a generic overview so I think the mayor's proposal gives us the basis for the debate on the issues that we might want to raise today but as I say there's a whole several months where we are receiving or weeks where we're receiving feedback from our communities and then there are the hearings of the submissions uh different engagement opportunities with the public and and then finally uh decisions to be made in june so it's it's a process that we're we're really kicking off the public part of um today so I'd like to invite staff to uh present the report that we have in front of us today obviously there are requirements under the local government act um that we need to uh meet and uh I'd be very grateful I'm not sure whether it's dye or peter that's um introducing the report today peter said die and die said peter so peter good morning look the chief executive has asked me to spend a few moments at the beginning of this to frame where to understand the depth of the process we followed here this ltp actually began 18 months ago in september of 2019 which feels like a hell of a long time ago it began with the mayor councillor's letter of expectation which set out a very clear framework for what was expected the bottom line of that was transparency accountability and a good balance now that balance feature we didn't understand at the time was going to be tougher than it sounded because we didn't know about covert we didn't know about two annual plans we didn't know about the airport dividends we didn't know a lot of things at that point but construction began and it was the fact that we started early and much earlier than we ever have before that meant that when we hit covert and lockdowns staff were in a position to keep working which they they did right through the whole lockdown period the activity plans asset plans and so forth were being built that meant that by the middle of next year when we started to get our draft ltp to deal with not everything was there but much of it was the bottom line of that level of preparation meant that you did get to see every budget every level of service you got to go through the capital program at nauseum at infinitum to get it right where you wanted it the situation was evolving as we watched the ltp evolve so there's a degree of flexibility right to the end of where we got to the end result is that you're seeing stuff you've never seen before for example the asset plans have never been through council before they've never been adopted with the ltp before there have been a lot of adjustments and reductions uh to the volume of levels of service so they're clearer uh you've had greater transparency around the asset plans and activity plans than ever before where we find ourselves is in an unusual place in that for the past decade uh we've been dealing largely with looking back at earthquake impacts this ltp doesn't really do that it looks forward um set of circumstances whereby the big projects of the city are committed to they've been consulted upon with both the crown and the public so things like metro sports are already there and other things are already committed to as well either by deliberate choice or by necessity we must renew our assets according to the guidelines the instruction from council was to protect core levels of service especially around things like roading and two waters three waters they're things that can't_''_520.24 be compromised we have money from the crown for roading and water and we're not going to look at a gift horse in the mouth and not take and spend and use that money wisely so in other words there are a lot of things that we in the must-do space but equally the financial prudence guidelines around how we handle our financials and the headroom we leave ourselves for to deal with another event should one occur and our debt levels and so forth they haven't moved which means that our financial position and parameters are heavily committed the things we're have less room in this ltp for uh freedom of choice than than many people might imagine and that I mentioned that because it frames what you see in the consultation document so that's that's how we got here we are still working with audit new zealand on the consultation document to get some of the very fine points around that sorted uh you received a new copy yesterday that has been updated just very quickly as I mentioned earlier today the changes you've seen to that document from the one released in the first report to put a very clear summary at the front of what our proposal is to provide the reader with the things we didn't put in our proposed approach to the ltp and why and how they work and what the negative consequences of those things would be so that if they disagree with the council's proposal they can make an informed decision about what they would like to see done differently and what those options were and why council didn't use them so they they can make an in our proposal as much as what that we did as well as that we've made some other changes to the cd to bring it closer into line to what audit's looking for so that's the the task in front of council today I will say that I haven't seen in any of the ltp since 2005 when effectively when they began in new zealand the level two of detail to which both opex and capex have been worked through by the councillors and by staff there's been about a hundred hours of counsellor time devoted to mostly those two topics and I realized at a time some of it may have seemed a bit painful or repetitive but what it means is the council has arrived at a proposal which given the loss of dividends from the airport and the impacts of covert has delivered a rates figure that compares favorably with a lot of councils delivers a capital program which is almost at the absolute capacity of what we can meaningfully build we don't want to plan for something we know we preserved the head room we need in the event of another crisis and has kept our debt levels prudent so that's the the optimum position the sweet spot whatever you want to call it um and that's what we're putting out in the staff and counsellor recommended proposal so that's really the summary of how we got here and what we've got to are there questions for staff sarah I know that you had a question thank you um I've got a couple of small bits from there but I'll just go back um to what you were saying earlier about uh our position with covert um and I know that during the annual plan last year we were we made sort of the 18 million worth of operational savings and deferred a whole pile of capital we've lost dividends we had to borrow more to cover shortfall from our facilities those kind of things what position would we have been and had it not been recovered like what if we if we'd still bring in the same dividends made the annual plan long-term plan where would we be at um thank you council I've got um bruce is just looking up that detail of that email that he sent to you yeah so I'll ask him to join us here at the table I don't think we can easily answer that question um the because there were a number of things we did as a response to covet and the question would be would we have done those things would we have gone to cchl and asked for uh more dividend if we hadn't had covered and yeah but so but the if we look at the actual impact so if we had if we had had the same sort of dividends and we hadn't had to borrow the money for our facilities but we had gone through the same process that we have had this time and made the significant amount of savings um and deferred capital do we have an idea where that might have put us well certainly certainly if we hadn't lost so much dividend the the rates increases would effectively rate increases that have been brought forward that would have been incurred in later years will be part of the answer so some of the rate increases out and probably 25 26 have come forward because of covert but there would also be some probably some permanent um we I you know I'd be guessing but we we could have been looking at a three or four percent rate increase this year rather than five and a half okay um and just there's a couple of small things the um the sustainability grant the sustainability fund um there's a line in the grants and funds page which shows innovation and sustainability fund which was the old name completely gone the consultation document has 380 000 for the sustainability fund but it's not showing in the grants and funds section no it was was 400 000 and it was funded from the capital endowment fund which was why it was showing lower down uh it's it continues it's it's taken a five percent haircut so it's at 380 000 and it goes caught up in the strengthening showing it's it's showing in the um contestable strengthening communities grants line but that will be pulled out separately for those yes separately we've simply bundled it up into that top line and we should have kept it separate and the heritage one includes intangibles so we'll be able to list those ones separately because we do biodiversity of 190 000 which goes right across all ten years there's also in that strengthening community design we'll separate that out and should write them all out yeah that's great thank you I've got uh yarny then sam thank you um I'm just interested in the additional money that's been put on for the stadium amenity it's not it's not been called out in any way that people can understand it I think it's about 25 million why have we not explicitly highlighted that I'm not sure what the right answer is there except that possibly is it something we've consulted upon already no no it's new money um in the 26 million and it's in to enhance the streets around the stadium so apparently it's not part of the stadium project but it's additional spend it's significant and it just seems weird that it's not highlighted as something that people should be aware of well that's certainly something we could have a look at okay um just the other question I had was really in some of the report particularly on on page 20 of the introduction it makes reference to the organics plant upgrade being in response to complaints but I think we actually need to be a lot more detailed around the fact that that's actually a breach of contract by the operator who's responsible for meeting the consent and therefore we have a legal requirement to respond to ecan so I just wondered if that section can be amended to be very explicit that actually it's not about the complaints the complaints actually um have been there but actually it's about the fact that actually the complaints have been substantiated by the regulatory authority which requires us's proposal and I think yanI's raised a good point so I i would like the words to be you know sort of accurately describe what um happened so not that we're doing this in response to complaints that that we we did this in response to action you know or um notice notice from ecan uh so we just need the correct words that are placed in there and I know that subsequent to us making the decision uh an abatement notice was served in order to ensure that we were um delivering on uh on that so even with the subsequent reference with the reference to the subsequent issuing of the abatement notice I think would satisfy um yanI's concern is that right yep good understood yeah thank you just oh sorry I just had two more questions two more one one was um in regards to the capital acceleration fund I'm kind of trying to understand like in terms of the plan we're highlighting that we're gonna do it but it's not really up for submissions is it we've why we've got a separate process to engage the community but in terms of the the ltp where we've highlighted the um those that that expenditure that's that's going to happen that's not up for change or there's no way we can amend that I'm not sure what you would consult what I'm what I'm concerned about is we're currently out asking people to give us a whole list of transport projects for the acceleration fund and if it comes back that we get I'm pretty sure we'll get more demand than what we've got um then are we able to make changes as a result of that well I'd have to defer to the transport planners but I can't imagine a situation in which we wouldn't make changes based on feedback except it's a separate process that's ahead of the ltp yes but the ltp doesn't spell out every project that we're going to do under craft okay and then finally I just was in terms of the water people that are interested in the issue can contact council now and get how much their average data use is that information is not currently available so I know we've been doing some meter readings but I'm concerned that for people to make an informed submission unless they know what the impact is on them it's quite hard to say whether it's something that you support or have concerns about because you don't you simply don't know when would we be in a position to advise people what the latest meter readings have been of their water use the simple answer is I don't know off the top of my head uh firstly the meter would have to be accurate and secondly someone would need to read it calculate the difference and go back to the people um so we need to find out from the water team what can can I just raise that as one thing that I think I mean because I know we've been doing the the quarterly meta readings um but yeah thanks but if I can indicative of whether you're going to uh whether your water consumption is um above the 700 liters a day because it's expected to only apply in the summer fix it well as I understand it what they do is it's the quarterly um average use that they take into account so people would still know like for the last three months for example yes but each quarter isn't necessarily indicative of the next quarter no no I understand that but at least where we've already done meter readings it's we're not doing it on an annual basis we're doing the charging on a quarterly basis yeah so people would still be able to see for the last three months over summer for this particular period anyway um that what they were using which I suspect this period is probably one of the periods of high demand we'll work with helen to understand what can be done in that space yeah and come back to you thanks cool uh sam cool um thank you team for this uh just two really quick around the capital program did the I mean I know there's a proposal there of a level of spend did the staff have a particular view on what that level should be so I'm just trying to gauge the difference between I guess the prudent level that staff would put forward as opposed to what we've landed on by majority we our initial initial recommendation for the um council charge but was around 400 million we then recommended something slightly lower our our key recommendation is 3.75 but after working with the capital group and looking at our longer term projection we felt we could make and you'll see that in the tables we're still maintaining our 400 million headroom in all but two years when which is around the time of the stadium being delivered which was the key period we're working through so we have managed by other means to sort of get ourselves through that with minimal risk to the council right okay cool thank you and just the other one was around the heritage ground or the heritage targeted raid be if it was just uh and it doesn't have to be now even if I just get it later on what the if it was a flat charge across the city what that would be per household as opposed to the capital value charge oh we could get that yes yeah could I get that at some stage thanks cool thank you thank you uh jimmy and then melanie one question on pages 67 consultation document proposed the rickson rule bus launches to be closed uh I remember this issue several years ago when the staff you know and also come to approve this one there were two conditions concerned first one is a particular emphasis in the central region area every day they have three thousand people body business in the central region area second is the main purpose you know to set up this past the launch is the kind of cut the traffic accounting and making the rules safer for petitions I'm concerned now in order because the if at least the past lunch has been closed whether these the two you know the this effect it is my concept because totally different from the several years ago in that kind of criteria I'm not sure how we can respond other than to ask richard to address your concerns there and explain a little bit more of the rationale behind what they're doing um I can't talk to the technicals of the lounge decision myself off the off the hip um but we can ask richard osborne to to come back to you on that thank you melanie um these are around the um excess water charge um one I was just wondering if we could include the median value of the volume of water because it's significantly lower than the average I think that would be helpful yeah we'll discuss that in the workshop do we I still think it will be useful um and um the other one has about the exemption so there's two exemptions included and we may discuss this as well but I don't recall because it doesn't mention about exemptions for large households so can we include that as one water leaks and medical purpose use uh we might need to clarify here diane's just mentioned that she doesn't recall the exemption for large households so I'm we talked about it was in last year's annual plan and we have always talked about it okay I think we need to clarify this just to figure out where things are at I've also written that down in my notes and we've talked about this too no no I i don't don't doubt that I'm just wondering what the difference is between your notes and and what we've got so I need to clarify that it's the ability to um to intervene isn't it if if there is a large household it wasn't an automatic that's correct no but it would be nice to have a spout out here I think right yeah okay so so it's just the wording that you want to see I would like a third bullet point so it's page 31 32. there would be some exemptions to the charge such wording was we had last time may I just ask how how do you define large please well maybe that's something we need to discuss but it wasn't the same as what we had last year more than two no more than small so so the counselor is correct in her recollection both in terms of annual plan two and the discussion so uh I'm just carolyn it's important that helen and richard because these are areas of specific technical question they need to be in the room to be able to remind members okay because it just say right including well it's got there would be some exemptions to the charge such as unexpected high use due to an unknown water leak uh water use for medical purposes um but you could you could just put exceptionally large households you know I mean it's it's it's going to be the exception we're not yeah yeah because with this this is 700 um liters which is well over the average so all right but I i don't I don't the documentation it was what we discussed you're right pauline thank you and then jake mine's just a wording issue as well on the organics processing plant and it's relating to the expenditure over the next 10 years and it's but it's convoluted with the move so the paragraph that reads the first three years will focus on the upgrades at the organics processing plant and materials recovery facilities sites so I think we should probably make it a little bit clearer that we're intending to upgrade the organics processing plant by january 2022 and the rest of the money will be obviously on the move so if we could just differentiate between the upgrade time frame I think it would be really helpful otherwise people might get upset about that thank you we can definitely make that clearer uh jake um yeah so a suggestion or a question um given that our auditors had some some sort of hiccups with that we weren't presenting enough options in terms of you know from the things we discussed and break things um uniform annual progressive tax was something we discussed and were presented with four different options on have you thought of including that in the consultation document so people could some that mean that's a proposal that would reduce the rates of I think 87 of christchurch residential rate payers no we didn't because when we presented it the consensus around the room was not to proceed and so we didn't we should present some more options though just signaling that that's an amendment I'd like to deal with maybe not today but certainly before the fourth well we're hoping that we can get things on the table today but I did note a question sam asked before and and I'm interested in the answer to that question as well um because I mean it is an item that we could structure a debate around today um which is uh do we um well with one end of the spectrum remove all of the uniform annual general charging that we have um it's it's at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of where it is um but it does have an impact uh and but the other question is is you know should there be other elements that are added to the uniform annual general charge you know we we have the um the uh waste levy we have a um uh twenty dollars I think it is for active transport is it still is that it's still on the on the on the books um and then but but then the heritage one I i mean I am interested in the question that sam asked which was how much would that be if it were a flat charge across the city I i personally would favor that so it looks like that that could be something that could be carved up as an amendment that would enable the debate about the issue but could pick up a broader issue which is could the heritage one be looked at as a flat rate as opposed to a related to the uh capital value sounds great as long as there's some lead room as leeway I should say for people to just say if we were in order for councils to be able to debate that issue of um removing uagc's there would be quite a we'd need a bit of time to recalculate what the rates are yeah otherwise um councils would be trying to debate something without the information no no I understand that and that will take I'll need to check but they would take a little while as in but we could potentially debate it this afternoon um potentially but I'll have to go away and check right but anyway we're not saying that we're definitely going to do that today but um let's let's just um work out what that would would require and I remind you that you do have thursday as well if you wish to take that time yeah um andrew thank you um so just on that um issue um if we were going to go to that debate we need to remember that it isn't just black and white we need to provide for some shades of grey in between as well matter that jake's raised yes yeah all right thank you um the matter that I wanted to raise though and by way of a question in the cd um under the heading service desks um that highlights quite clearly there the proposal to close the littleton and akaroa service desks um based on low levels of transactions and that's made clear in the document as well what are we referring to as transactions in that regard is it just financial transactions again I can't answer off the hip that level of detail but we certainly can investigate the spreadsheet behind it and try and find out what what a transaction is yeah if it's strictly a financial one or or does it cover enquiries for example yeah I think we need to be I mean this is something that there will be some interest in those local communities I think we need to be clear so if it is financial transactions my suggestion would be that we should say low level of financial transactions um or if it's wider than that then you know maybe so if we can have clarification on that that would be great second I'm just sorry to interrupt you I'm just wondering if mary is able to answer that question for you yeah so we're proposing to close the service desk of zacaroa according littleton and it states pretty clearly in the cd um that that's because of a low level of transactions is that just financial transactions that we're referring to when we say that it's mainly the financial transactions because they're the ones that people tend to use the service centre for more uh but it isn't it's also the low level of foot count as well so it's both financial transactions and foot count into the into those service centers all right now that's that's useful to know and it'll be useful for the local community to know that um when they you know decide what they think about this that's good um so second question relating to the same thing that's called out well in the consultation document it's very of service in the activities and services statement of service provision tables I mean I guess the argument for that could be that it's in line with the provision of seven to 13 hubs which is the level of service but the level of service provision over the previous two periods referred to in that table is 12 hubs so there may not be a difference in the target level of service but there is a difference in the level of service proposed to be provided should that not be called out in that table as well yeah that's clear enough uh so yeah we could definitely look at just adding a point of clarification there that while technically it might be met it's not the same yeah it's a change to the current level of service provision yes yes so if we can add that in I just would hate to think that people had gone looking through parts of the document and didn't see it and didn't see it in the cd and therefore didn't realize it was happening fair enough I just checked on that stadium support package and we were originally advised and the project sheet was 25 million but on the capital program it's only listed as five so I don't know whether that's an error or whether money's been reduced um so I just thought that might be helpful there's also just a bit more clarity on that there's a number of um water supply renewals there are about eight million dollars so again like total cost of the stadium the multi-use arena sorry um it would be really good just to highlight what the actual cost is um and I just was going to check on the property disposal process because we were told that it was you know going to be smaller ones that would be put forward but things like the yha we've we've had no information about that as best I can tell and yet it's been listed to be sold the five was just straight so there's also a number on here that haven't been to the community board um and board was looking at which is on the list so I'm just trying to understand that property proposal disposal list how those things have been selected and why there hasn't been a sort of intermediary process where us for us to give that feedback first um and then I had one final question around the dc's but I'll just leave those two okay um look on the property issue I think that maybe the best thing would be to uh ask bruce rendell to come right later in the day is it possible just to move an amendment to remove those well it might be better to have the discussion with bruce to understand how things got there okay cool um and so the the development contributions policy as well like that's the one that um the whole idea of where we've got intensification happening no projects to compensate for the environmental and amenity loss of trees uh parks um that sort of thing or outdoor space we're kind of in a chicken and egg we're told if we don't have but we haven't signed off on our development contribution policy so we don't know what projects um could go in there to deal the growth so the so I'm just trying to understand what the process is for us signing off on the development contributions policy and list of projects that do get dc's when we do that and also just want to be really clear and understand that um development contribution rebate um you know the money that's going to subsidize the the residential development in the central city when do we get a chance to um support that on budget or not we've had the development contributions policies going up for consultation which will make that redundant it will make it a redundant question due to the changes that have been going to be proposed but I don't know I believe that's coming on the 11th but I've just got an answer here from um on dc's that you can't charge dc for loss of amenity or streetscape improvement no but the idea was that for example we don't have any capital projects to to you know cater for the growth and demand for things like the playground I thought we could have a growth project related to the development to put in additional facilities in the area are you saying that we can't I'm saying you can't charge a development contribution on a loss of amenity right um but the policy is coming I believe it's the 11th of march that the policy is coming for discussion brendan brendan's nodding so it will be here on the 11th of march so it will be in place in time for the the conclusion of the ltp only if we agree with it though because if it comes and it's missing what yanI's saying which I think is actually quite quite a discussion point then it may not so yeah and sorry what I was talking about we've got to go out I meant for the individual properties where you've got you know big houses that have trees and a backyard it's going to go out for no the question is how do we add projects to cater for growth if we're not doing the dc's policy as part of this today well because it's been developed in conjunction with this and it's coming in two weeks so then that will amend the capital that can amend the capital program if it's not already there then yes you could make that change would you like to come up to the table I should point out the dcp is no longer part of the long-term plan it's run separately the legislation broke it out in order to deal with just this timing issue yeah so it is actually a separate but parallel thing with overlap not part of the ltp I think the answer to your question is the capital program which is part of the ltp uh those components of the capital program that under the legislation can be linked back to legitimate dc charges uh included so if you wanted to add projects the um time and the place to do it would be to add projects to the council so you're um adopting the draft uh capital program as part of adopting the draft ltp and uh that goes out for public consultation and and you'll undoubtedly get feedback on that and then you adopt the final ltp which includes the final capital program the dc policy will be finalized shortly after the council adopts the final capital program so it will adopt the final capital program at the end of june this year and the dc policy um will come shortly thereafter which will then reflect the capital program that the council has adopted right does that make sense so the mechanism is via the capital program that you're adopting at a high level the principle of where we've got traditionally the um the areas uh that are having huge intensification um so huge loss of trees and and backyard space and we've got you know massive development happening like waltham um the principle around our dc's policy which I thought we had asked for work to be done around how do you have projects like growth projects to cater for the of the capital program is what you're saying if you wanted to add projects to create a new playground or a new open space or something like that then the place to do it is to add that project as part of the capital program it's a second order question about whether that project can be funded via dc's though the legislation is very specific about what can be found it can't_''_2576.8 be funded by dcs and I don't think we'll get support from the council table your example of trees being taken from someone's backyard through a densification um that can't_''_2587.04 be funded via dc's no but yeah we have strategic lamp we used to have a reserves um budget where when new development happened money went in and we we provided a sort of replacement of of things that were happening so I mean I know everything's changed but that's right I'll wait for the dc's policy amendments to the capital program based on on that by the time we sign off on this uh add capital projects then the mechanism is probably via the capital program that you're doing as part of either the drafting of the ldp or the final ltp and you can't add capital projects at the time of adopting the dc policy no and so can I can I suggest that the appropriate time will be you know during the course of the um of the ltp process prior to the final ltp being adopted if there are any additional capital projects that need to be um put in in that time then that's the appropriate time to do it rather than amend something without any background information at the front end um the point is when we um I don't know if council's maybe the new ones we've never seen it but when we get the dc's policy we actually get a schedule of projects broken down by how much they qualify for development contributions versus the general rate and so it's actually a really good way of seeing what what kind of qualifies for growth and what doesn't and expecting to get as part of the dc's policy thing that we sign off yeah and that list is taken from the capital program that council adopts the draft and that's exactly why we don't finalize the dc policy until after the final capital program is adopted at the end so what I'll do I'll put forward some projects ahead of that dc schedule being done and if we can get some assessment whether they meet the growth criteria in terms of dc's that would be helpful I mean prior to it being completed or or just prior to the 11th of march for consideration well I think we are they only do we need to consider are they already on our capital program no they won't be okay it needs to it needs to wait until after we go out for consultation yeah all right uh bruce would you like to come forward and answer yanI's other question and I missed it yani so can you ask it again so I was just concerned that some of the properties on the significant which is five foster boulevard yeah um I don't we may have got a mirror but I don't recall getting anything about the yha the last we provided guidance on that would be included in the list who did we did it was on it's been on the list right from the first time we saw it yha five rolls tonight if we sorry so what's the process that go through the community boards as well so just before you do bruce I will remind councillor that we did have a full briefing on the process before christmas which is why we took a report to council on exactly how the community boards would be engaged can you give him the detail again please yep so there's a set of criteria that is your criteria you've given to us we apply that we then circulate that list so this has been to community boards uh in an informal basis so that they can then consider that as part of their submission to the uh long-term plan it's also gone to another number providers knowing that there's uh interest in housing to manafenour as well and then submissions are made and council gets to consider uh the final um this make the final decision through the long-term plan when decisions can be made both financially as well as whether or not we need the land for any strategic purpose good are there any other questions for staff uh aaron yeah I i have a couple one is um on the land drainage targeted rate and it's the switch from the people that are not paying it I've just done a skim over a whole lot of properties across the city seems everyone pays it and it's got a thing there there will be a link to a map but who is being added into that the main people being added in are those in rural properties those in banks peninsula and there are areas of the city within the outer suburbs who are not currently paying those are the key properties being added right there's hardly any in total isn't a number of properties well there's we want to tidy it up and get it fixed right okay um so that's that one and then the other one is um around the transport one uh it's got uh for the buses the spending of we put in um 96.7 million for bus infrastructure over the next 10 years and the do we have uh an outcome of target numbers like what will be the um the net saving of carbon for spending that amount of money that doesn't seem to be in there anywhere it doesn't say where we get to uh look sometimes I know there'll be a 40 increase in bus usage was the number richard osmond gave us which so that takes you from 2.2 to 3 of people's trips being on the bus but how big's the dent in our emissions which from transport are 36 um look I wish richard were here but I do have to take a punt at something here which is there is a line between what council's responsible for and what other agencies do and we're responsible that we aren't responsible for how many people do or don't use the bus service or the carbon impact of that and the ltp the points been made to us from both within by councillors and by audit needs to be very clear about we do what we what we control and we don't build in targets around things that we don't control so we must be signing up to I mean because we declared a climate emergency so you can't have an emergency and then not have net targets that you must get to because if 36 of our emissions come from transport we must be going we'll lower it by this this and this which must have net targets in it especially spending 96.7 and my next number's bigger I understand um I'm not trying to be bureaucratic about it so much as saying that I think your concern needs to be in the right place which is maybe at the level of strategic directions rather than a level of service which is we contract to deliver x amount as but should that those numbers that were in those strategic directions with all the various agencies should that not be in here when we're spending that much money I believe that some of that is in the strategic directions but it's not in the levels of service which I'm saying it's about where it is rather than than the need for it um but I thought there were quite a lot of goals because you yeah you spend a dollar get 10 cents back not a great investment spend a dollar get eight dollars back great investment because the other one is the and it's the same question again as the cycleways are in here for an extra 235.8 million dollars and once again it is what is the net gain on our carbon emissions like the reduction from that like at the end of that 10 years we can go we will we're currently there we will we will be there because that's why we're spending quarter of a billion dollars again I think it's about where where that information got the strategic directions I believe that that kind of global ambition for the city probably sits there rather than as a level of service for staff to deliver but to get the public buy-in they've got to see miserable so they know that when we do this this and this we get to there it's like does that make sense it does um but look I don't want to repeat myself too much I think it has to be in the right in the right place those goals and the data around them very properly belong in things like the climate change strategy the strategic directions the measures around the strategic directions but if you provide them to staff as a level of service in the same way as make sure the grass is cut and so forth you'll you're at the wrong level if you know what I mean I I'd be welcome welcoming anybody else who wants to change we shouldn't be spending quarter of a billion dollars without seeing the outcomes of the measurable outcomes of of that spend the health board but there's a number of people that die from respiratory related illnesses in christchurch due to our air pollution so this is imminent this isn't in 50 or 100 years time people die every year so we need to this is a health issue as much as it's a climate issue and we should have the measurable outcomes to say in 10 years time because of these actions this many less people died but also we've done this for the planet no I i understand but outcomes outcomes normally go in things like the community outcomes the strategic directions the climate change strategies where big global outcomes for the city tend to rest so I'm just talking about the right information in the right spot right okay look so the public won't see that when they make submissions on it because we'll get we're going to get quarter of our submissions will be people coming in talking about climate change that's that's the environment we're living in and so they should be able to see miserable there and less there because that is what they want but we must be able to measure it you can't just say climate change you've got to actually do something yeah the climate change strategy has been dealt with in parallel so I think it's a bit of a difficulty in one sense because it's so how does that have the outcomes of where we get to for each dollar spent because there's people that work for the un that do that that tell you every dollar wherever you spend it will tell you what your outcomes will be like all these numbers exist can I just maybe clarify something if you if you build cycleways you expect an impact there's a big difference between measuring that impact and seeing whether it's working in say community outcomes or the climate change strategy or whatever and saying we measure this and we're testing whether it worked or not because building the cycle way doesn't guarantee that you will get the people you want but you can test that by measuring it but it on staff as a target which is what a level of service does one is a piece of intelligence that tells you your investment is paying off or not the other one is a task you're placing on staff to deliver and I'm not sure that staff can deliver reduction in carbon through cycleways they build them they don't guarantee yeah I mean it's the same thing there are statutory levels of service that are imposed on councils throughout the country which the staff cannot deliver they can't deliver them alone um because it is a combination of effect so that um there is there anyone else there's a target on the number of deaths on roads for example which we we contribute to by building safe roads by having education programs in schools by doing a variety of things having cycleways that even contributes to the number of deaths on roads um and we don't make it demonstrably safe a reduction yeah yeah and so but you know in terms of people feeling safe about being on the road and and contribute but they don't they don't enable staff to deliver the levels of service I mean we our target should be zero but it's not the statutory target that's given to the staff of every council in the country so you know I mean I understand what peter's saying and I understand what you're saying the the the measurable should be in the implementation plan that sits around the climate change strategy yeah because it should come down to the public should be feeding back especially the ones that are right into it should be feeding back on no spend more money there because we get a lot better bang for buck than spending it over here like in my wardrobe you're going to point about the climate change strategy but it's coming to sarah's committee shortly so perhaps sarah would you like to just comment on it well I was actually I was going to ask um if the approach that aaron's suggesting where we have a a dollar for you know banky but kind of approach when we've taken to for example a similar level of investment in the stadium so do we know for every dollar no that's a no I'm just what I'm trying to do is to guide people helpfully into um a situation where um and it's kind of picking up on what peter's saying is that the staff aren't responsible for the I know I'm just trying to draw an analogy and neither are they no but it's not a helpful analogy it is because the business case for the stadium sorry please what would be really helpful is if we could see our way clear to isolating where that information should be held and where those measures should be able to be found and it seems to me that the climate change strategy with its implementation plan should actually be the place where we can see those measurable reductions in carbon and the climate change strategy is a high level documents coming to the committee tomorrow within it there is the zero emission transport plan which will have all the information there is councillor davidson that's working on all of that sort of stuff at the moment there are expressions of interest you could be coming along to the meetings you'll be able to see all the data about all of those kind of things those meetings um are open to any counsellor to turn up to um and yeah so I mean all the information is around nzta has all of the cost benefits trying to do we had a business case on the cycleways aaron was trying to do helpfully was to um to to daylight the issue and the context of the spend except that I'm just going to say that if you're only isolating one project for that concept of spend and not saying we should be doing it for all projects then then there's a disparity but we do do it I misunderstood aaron say that he was only talking about one project he was only mentioning I think he was looking at a number of projects in the public the public yeah so the sustainable transportation council is on the working group during that process too absolutely yeah anyway so um I i I would like to think that um yeah I the the the way that I think that it would be helpful to to to address the issue is um to see how much of the uh that will the engagement that we have on the climate change strategy is able to draw that information out into the public arena because I think by the time we get to the ltp because the the consultation will be will be completed on the on the climate change strategy before we conclude the ltp so we should be in a position by the time we get to the final set of decisions on the ltp to be able to have a really clear understanding of what the investment and the whole range of different projects will do in order to achieve the carbon reductions that we need to make as a city so um and we're not responsible for the for whole of them which is um why we've we've set a a target of 2025 but it's don't simply control all of the different aspects of the city that would enable us to achieve that and from a council point of view 2030 and we need to see measurable and deliverable and delivering results as we get to 2030 so um and I'm hoping that that's what the climate change strategy will help us um to address but it does need to be as you say wrapped into the final leg of this process so that they all come together and people can see that their investment in the capital program is producing the climate action that we want them to produce yeah sarah upstairs if you want some data so the average kiwi drives 10 000 kilometers a year um and that's two tonnes co2 no aaron was asking for specific information it's two tons of co2 for every ten thousand k your bike can we try and give you some form of discipline okay yeah thank you I am trying to be helpful to people to um raise these issues uh but are there any other issues generally because um next next little item people generally done with questions chair um helen's here she may be able to answer yanI's question about water meter readings helen and helen can you also touch on the issue of large families because it needs to be included in the documentation yes I've got notes on um two or three things that have come up so if if it helps if I just go over those to start with so um just a reminder because it's sometimes since we had our workshop talking about water charging so the allowance is 700 liters per day assessed quarterly okay so not over a year as we did in the annual plan proposal that's assessed quarterly so if you go over your average of 700 liters per day in any one quarter then you're liable for a bill for that quarter the um that allowance compares with 540 liters per household per day which is an average use and remember that average use includes ordinary household use and garden watering which is a favorite activity here in christchurch in the garden controls on it if you like a reminder that quarterly so we are reading meters quarterly that doesn't mean that we're going to read a quarter of the city on the 1st of march and then a quarter of the city on the 1st of june and then a quarter on the 1st of september they will be rolling reads around the city so you'll get your meter read not not exactly every 91 days but usually between 80 and 100 days and it'll be averaged over that period all right so that's a quarterly reading and a rolling reading across the city in terms of getting information out to households we've started those quarterly readings already so we're starting to get that information together and we will be sending notices out to people so they know how much they've been using in each quarter and most people will see that they use a relatively small amount in the winter and if they're very keen on their use of water outdoors for gardens or swimming pools and for such they will we will get that information out to people on a rolling basis we're also working on an app where they can get that they can draw that information from us rather than us send it out now that that is a work in progress and there's no guarantee we'll get that up and running in time and in fact there's no guarantee we'll get it up and running at all because we just need to check with legal about whether that information is considered private okay so there's a bit to work through there but that would that would be the best actually that people can just assess it themselves in terms of the first bill nobody would get a bill until the first summer so that's the summer of 2022. so if council after hearing submissions adopts this then the ordinary water use through the first couple of quarters is likely to be low and within the allowance for a house a household and they wouldn't get a bill until the summer if they did get a bill earlier than that that's one of our exemption provisions so if you've got an undetected leak on property and that's leading you to use you know 2 000 liters per day and you provide evidence that you've fixed that leak then you can get an exemption from that unexpected and ridiculous water bill all right so we will address households the household side of the meter leaks through this process as well so remember that that exemption and the final thing people were asking about large families we do not have an exemption for large families which we did have under the annual plan proposal and that's because the 700 liters per day is more than sufficient for ordinary household use even for large families so 700 liters per day is a lot of water and we expect that large families will be able to function perfectly well with that we have retained an exemption for medical purposes however again we don't expect we'll ever have to use it 700 liters per day is again a lot of water and should provide for that so the leaks on proof that you've fixed them so that's that's the quick summary any other medical purposes and medical yes yeah yeah I've got sarah melanie yani thank you and the other one that we had last time and I've had a quick answer back just now was around community uses for water so we have several places around many places around the city where we have council reserve land where we're doing native plantings or there's a community garden next door on council with land where the private residence is allowing their tap to be used to help water the natives growing in drayton reserve for example or or at a community garden and they community activities that are of benefit to council and to the wider community but it's an individual tap being used and I'm wondering if there was a specific we we did put this in last time a specific exemption we would be able to use for people doing that so that we have significant amount of council what we would prefer to planting is to a separate title to that household that's letting them use their outside tech but it's a councilwoman yeah we would prefer that they had their own supply if it's on a piece of council land so parks and reserves for example usually have their own supply so they're separately metered yeah they often don't have as the play at all what we would prefer to do is to give them their own supplies so they should come and talk to us and we'll get their uh their own supply point put in otherwise that household we have no way of monitoring that household's use yeah there's very very few of them across the city it seems like it'll be easier just to exempt those properties and put it would be easier for us to manage the water use to give them their own supply it's relatively simple to do that okay we might get we can see if we need some parks advice on that maybe just in the next hour I mean sorry to stop I will keep hiking it true we had um we were going to we were talking about an excess water charge for over 915 liters per day and I realized that if people's rates were low we were going to be charging them earlier on than those with higher rates but we also had the large families included so it doesn't quite add up to me so we've done some more work on patterns of use and the pattern the high users are those with large gardens and irrigations or undetected leaks there's very little correlation there is some correlation with family size but it doesn't it doesn't push it over the 700 liters per day there's no harm including um you know extra large households is there because there's no harm in it because as you say you've got the medical one in there you might never need it what I would need to be very clear on is what do you mean by a large household so if it's um a flat for example with 12 people and they've all got of workers accommodation is that a large household or should we be charging them for the additional water that they're using you have to call it a family yeah well that's that's once you start getting into an exemption like that you start getting into a whole lot of questions about how you um how you manage and monitor that exemption this is only if they get a bill over 700 yes there are there are a large number of um very large properties with um multiple occupants which are sort of like boarding houses workers accommodation which do get billed now under the commercial abuse well and some do and some of them are residential and wouldn't get billed so we'd have to we'd have to have a look at that pretty carefully absolutely we've got a figure here of um per person 234.8 liters a day average if you had six kids and two adults they could use up to 16 1600. no that's not correct so the averages are misleading so that average per person is taking the average a household so the average six-person household doesn't use six times the average one-person household quite obviously there are lots of different things going on in any one household so it's not it's not reasonable to multiply the average single person used by six for a six person household it's not how it works well that's very helpful information actually so so just to uh not to achieve my very excellent officer off but clearly it is your prerogative if you wish to see something added to the annual plan in terms of exceptions and then you would task us with a way to achieve that to make sure it would work but it may be that we need more detailed information in the cd itself which describes what the averages mean yeah I think something should be included in case there is a case where it is actually applied if we don't include it we can't do it and it will be unfair but isn't there what about allowing for a discretion that enables staff to um consider a situation like could put in a we could put in a discretionary one if you like which would be um around large families and financial hardship or medical grounds or so yeah one single discretionary clause if you like I would recommend you do that yeah I think that solves the the problem and that and that would get over the um the sort of multiple worker accommodation can I just say financial hardship though is very hard to determine and if a remission allows staff or puts it on staff to make a decision then it's it's difficult to implement fairly so what how do you define financial hardship around here as to um how to do that there are provisions in a variety of pieces of legislation which allow um you know hardship or an equity to to be a driver so let's say take it offline but you're getting a direction from us that we want uh the capacity for staff to be able to to to offer an exemption um you know where the where there are good reasons that sit in behind it know which includes the medical medical situation that you've described as well yeah uh yani oh yeah thanks I just wanted to check so when did we start doing the quarterly readings and when will we be in a position to have done all the quarterly readings across the city for the first time so we started quarterly readings late last year and those are rolling out across the city at the moment they're not universal at the moment and in some places we can't find the meters so there's a bit of uh there are a few teething problems running on did you ask when we would be able to send out information I'm just yeah what I'm really trying to understand is when will someone know over the quarter what their use has been so people can read their meters today so we've got quite clear um directions and instructions on our website on how to read your own meters so if they want to do that they can they can do that just look on the website and go and sending notices what I'm trying to understand is that the question yeah we started doing the quarterly reading at what point do we get an assessment of what the average daily use has been for the readings that we started at the end of last year so when will people know formally from when could people find out formally from us if they wanted to what their average data use has been over the last quarter um they can find out today if they email and ask or phone up and ask not not that I'm wanting 30 000 of them to phone up tomorrow what we would like to do is um over the next three to six months send notices out to people and let them know and we're putting that in place at the moment because we've got a new contract going out for me to reading right could it be done at the same time as the rates demand to save us from postage no because we've got a rolling program of readings so it's a different mechanism we're just to just to confirm so I want to make sure that the message has landed the first time if you agree at the appropriate time in june that you're going to adopt this the first time the public will receive a bill is in summer 2022. that's correct for the vast majority of people for the vast majority of people that's the first time they'll receive a bill for the few people who have major leaks on their properties they may receive one almost immediately however if it's due to a major leak and they didn't know it was there and they fix it we'll give them an exemption but yes for the vast majority of people it'll be summer 2022 I think but we will be informing the public helen will we not from go forward what their usage has been on a quarterly basis before we get to summer allow them to adjust their behavior yes so we'll give we'll what we'll do is let people know what their use has been whatever the frequency of have been quarterly for a year some of them may not for that be for that long but whatever readings we've got we'll let them know what their average uses from those readings yeah I just um so I think people will have plenty of information and time to adjust by the time it comes to hearing submissions if people are making submissions to us saying I'm really concerned about this proposal I'm going to be I'm worried I'm going to be charged examine z will people have a sense of what their average daily use has been over the last summer quarter that we're currently in yes they can get in contact and ask us and we'll let them know and a number of people did that last time for the annual plan hearings and most of them didn't come and make a submission to you because most of them were within the allowance yeah right great and just so I'm really clear the entire city's quarterly meter reading from start with the first reading so this is've used the first one of those will be complete when we're doing quarterly read meter readings now so we're rolling them out across the city now so some people have already had maybe three readings most people will have had one or two sorry it's the second one really that's the key so the first one to work out what the current state is no well let's go back so we have been reading meters in the city um ever since they went in but most residential ones only every two years some of them every one year so we already have data going back 10 15 years so so now we have more frequent readings than I understand it sorry just to be really clear the quarterly reading the first one we do we've done it yes then we do a second one so we can work out the average daily use for that time of the year yes yeah just to be really clear when in terms of the entire city will we have or you know recognizing there's a for an individual or a household be available they're available now they're all available they're available so we've done two quarterly reading we've done two meter readings mostly recorded yes to everyone already great thank you all right um do you want to just can I get for me can you just touch on uh the the three water reform process because the consultation document uh you know alerts us to the oh maybe it's not you um alerts us to the the bill but no no the three water reform process alerts us uh the cd alerts everyone to the fact that the government's going through a process at the moment and that this may well this will mean that we are likely to be uh going out to the community again before the end of the year with a consultation on on whether we buy into step two um because it's an opt-out provision as what we're told it will be and that the bill that will establish all of that is likely to be introduced in may so the ltp the consultation document quite rightly informs the public that this process is going on but one of the outcomes of that process may well be us going back out to count out to our communities asking whether they wish us to remain in or to opt out of the reform program yes so the water the water reform program is being run by central government and department of internal affairs is leading it and they as most people know have signaled that they wish to see water services that is water supply wastewater management and possibly stormwater management moved to um a regional delivery model so that when I say regional I don't mean regional councils in the region but yeah so four to eight delivery agencies across the country or possibly fewer so what they're doing at the moment is looking at what's required for the best outcomes for communities in terms of their water services and when we say the best outcomes for communities they're looking at all communities and again as you're probably quite familiar most people in large towns but quite a number of people are now much smaller rural towns and more village sized towns don't have good access to good water supply and wastewater management services and the outcomes for public health and for the environment have been very poor and particularly there are some particular incidents of course that people attention is drawn to so that um that process in terms of what is required to do that across the country is running at the moment with some international assistance and this council and a lot of other councils have provided information on who we deliver water services to um how we deliver those services in terms of the council and the contracted services what the asset base is what the needs are for investment and that information is being considered across the country to look at the best delivery models in parallel with that the the entities that deliver the water services are envisaged as standard standalone crown entities under their own um legislation so that is they are not council controlled or council-owned entities and that the way that watercare is for example and operated as a council-controlled entity so these entities would be set up under their own legislation and have specialist boards so the boards would reflect the communities that they serve and also have specialist expertise in terms of managing and governing water services which is big business and specialist business so I think the important thing is in relation to this ltp both advice from solgum and from central government as to why the wording is what is in our current ltp and it will be outside of the decision timeline of this particular document we will be having to work as an authority as will every authority to come to its conclusions about what we my eu wish to do probably no later than the end of this calendar year because the legislation won't go in until I was about to say summer but I do mean winter doing my northern hemisphere thing again so it will be outside this timeline and undoubtedly we will have to do the consultation process that's right and central government have flagged that they will put a lot of effort is proposed in terms of the reform so they're not asking each individual council to um to to do that themselves each individual council will do their own version of consultation and talking with their own communities but it'll be in that wider context so central government will provide a lot of information on the reform program and the reasons for it and what is proposed for national consistency but to be really clear this authority will remain responsible for the next three years for water which is the lifetime of this ltp that's great yes um so you're not abdicating your any responsibility that's right and the other thing that central government has said that they will do is ensure that the the process um works well for local government so if there need to be changes to the local government act or any other legislation to enable this to happen without local government having to tie itself and not around any transfer of assets or change in service levels then central government will look at that and make sure that the that the members have been invited to the roadshows that are in march 23rd of march I think it is yes yes I mean I've just you know I i kind of I don't want to kind of frighten people but in terms of the numbers that are being talked about by um central government in terms of the under investment and the infrastructure three waters infrastructure across the country um between 27 billion and 46 billion dollars uh would lead to massive increases in um and and and the cost to household bills um and and they had I mean I've just got a document in front of me which which pleasingly um I mean on one level uh says that all local authorities in new zealand were found to have been investing at a level below that needed to maintain the performance condition and risk profile of their assets except christchurch so christchurch has been signaled out singled out but I think that the part of the that has been the investment that was undertaken as a result of the earthquakes but I think that we collectively infrastructure I know that part of that has been driven off um the desire to return to chlorine-free status but I think that we're going to want advice from our officials as to what influence if if we were ultimately to end up with a um an independent company running the the three waters are we will we be in a position to um put in place some obligation to uh maintain the our commitment to safe drinking water that is also good to drink which means without that residual disinfection in place so that's the that's the level of advice that we're going to need to offer that kind of reassurance and to our own community about what our priorities are yeah and and that is recognized by central government that local government is very keen on community involvement and community influence in the delivery of these services because they are they are you know important to communities so yes I think that's a a strong feature of the submissions on the bill yeah um from across local government yeah I know that the committee on thursday and and I'm going to save some of my commentary for that occasion but you know there is the um the provision in there for the exemption which um uh you know which obviously we we want to be in a position not only to apply for ourselves but also to ensure that whatever structure is set up in the future that there is a clear understanding that residual disinfection isn't the um the panacea to the to the appropriate provision of safe drinking water which is our our our commitment but from a secure source um not requiring that so but anyway that's um yes uh uh tim sorry I remember your name now oh look you know how could you forgive me a lot of comment with regards to community but as we've seen with the rma the community has been um distanced from any ability to really have a true say and that's that process so I i think we need as a council and councils right through new zealand need really good um and clear wording from central be able to be part of it and continue to be part of it that goes forward because I can see this when we say reform etc and it's used quite a lot with the rma it's about reducing the ability of communities and loading the council's local bodies tas whatever with the responsibility and being looked as the cooking board for um that reduced reduction and ability to be to comment and I think that is a truly sad example of what central government's doing with rma so I'd really that's for me and I think forever on this table the key there thank you we look forward as officers to the detailed debate you undoubtedly will have later on in the year on this matter but we are going to have to go out and consult on it because the provision that we are likely to be faced with is an opt-out provision and when you opt out what are the obligations that we're going to have to take on in order to maintain the level of um standards that will what I'm saying when we go to consult we need to know what we're consulting on and we need that direction from central government yeah so if I can ask members to come back to the matter we are dealing with on the agenda would be really helpful thank you but it's connected it is connected because I think people do need to understand that we are constrained in terms of what we're consulting on in relation to the three waters because there is this additional engagement that is being undertaken at a central government level but we are also taking on as a regional level so within the canterbury mural forum we've instigated this work we have been in the position to provide the information that central government has asked for in order to inform the next stage of the process because I think we're we've been in a really um good position understanding our asset base and continuing to invest in our asset base in a way that's been um very useful so have we got any other questions water I have questions about just the for the comms team for katie so as can we move on to that or are we leanne can I ask that these are material to whether or not we accept the draft like we've spent 90 to 100 hours giving direction fleshing this out and I think it's seriously worrying if we're at a point I'm just going to get to sam in a minute and he will present okay audit and risk fun well I think it's around whether you accept the draft and then I'm going to have morning tea and then we are going to debate the um this is what we're here to do thank you so much your help yeah katie and just um just the question you know the challenge is always how do we engage meaningfully with our community about this document which is extensive and so just wondering if you could outline some of the strategies that you're going to use to gather the widest range of responses to this document when it's finally out already but just it would be helpful to know how you're going to actually address things like english as a second language those communities who don't perhaps traditionally engage with us certainly so um we will be using all of our council channels uh to get the information out um recognizing though that that doesn't reach everyone so we'll also be doing targeted a specific engagement with certain communities that we know are going to be harder to reach so we have some dates in the day already with the youth sector and we will also be looking to get into existing meetings for other organisations rather than trying to set up our own where we're hoping to dovetail in with other peoples because we always get better attendance we will be that said we will be having a couple of drop-ins at turanga we'll be inviting the public to come along and we'll be looking at what we can do out in the community working with governance teams in the community boards to set up some events out out there we will to a4 of information which is the summary of of the consultation document just to make it a little bit more accessible we'll be looking at how we translate certainly the call to action the fact that it is ltp time we probably won't be in a position to be able to um uh translate um a huge amounts of documentation but we will be making it very clear that it is the consultation time and we'll be working through our existing stakeholder database to sort of like leverage where we can hey can you also add about the new tool we have devised which we've tested with the community boards because that is brand new absolutely so we have a new tool this year which is the um which shows both our capital and operational expenditures so this is something that people can access online it's a level of accessibility that we haven't had previously so previously you'll recall if you'd like to find out anything in our long term plan you'll be looking through a hundred or so page able to use this tool to be able to search out projects that will be able to be searched by ward by project title and we're hoping that's really going to make things a lot more accessible for people to find out information that answers the question my next question which is exactly that how do local people access their local information so what does that tool look like and how do people know about it so we'll be making sure that we're promoting that tool widely uh on all of our channels that will be part of our launch strategy to make people very very aware um the the resources available to them as part of this ltp consultation fantastic and what about um community board plans will that be the sort of the the task of the community board if they have those local drop-ins to have those plans there yes yes we'll be looking to community boards for support on that thank you thanks very much so um and thank you to staff I'll now move on to the audit and discuss the process and and I'd like to invite council mcdonald who is the deputy chair of the armc to present the committee's advice yeah sure uh thank you leanne um counselors there's a memo on the hub for everyone as well already which just talks through our process I guess the point of this like we talked about with the annual plan last year was the audit and risk role in this so it's not necessarily to offer a view on the content but it's a it's a view on the process that we've got to and whether we're comfortable with the approach that's been taken by management and counsellors through that so I think like I reiterated at the last one we haven't come away with a resolution that says we're happy with the rates increase or the level of borrowing or things like that but in fact actually that the steps we've taken as a council and is with the management team to get there are comfortable so there's just three recommendations there which the process around management sign off and just the third one um I don't think it's up on the screen but it's really just around the consultation document um so obviously we had hoped to get that for friday at audit and risk um just as part of the context to do it but with the issues around um I guess how that's being managed by audit new zealand we've just uh just noted there that that's still to come so it hasn't affected our sign off at all uh noting that the chief executive and her team were working quite closely with audit new zealand to get that sorted so yeah there certainly weren't any flags from the committee on the day and uh kim wallace our independent chair uh you know went through it thoroughly with our independent members and does send her apologies for for today as well so there's nothing really else to add leanne if you're happy with that that's very good thank you so um with that can I um move the recommendations front of us and we have and I'll just quickly run through them um that we're receiving the information that's been contained and referred to in the staff report and the documents attached to it um noting the recommendations of the council's audit and risk management committee adopting the information that provides the basis for the council's draft ltp um and relied on by the content of the consultation document noting that the full version of the information can be found on the website uh adopts the mayor proposed mayor's proposal was outlined in attachment a adopts the consultation document in principle and this is in principle um because of the requirement to have a later meeting at which point formal adoption will occur so that isn't a point to sort of re-litigate anything it's simply the formal adoption once we have the auditor general's report as required by section 93 c four of the local government act authorizes the general manager of finance and commercial and the chairperson of audit and risk to make any non-material amendments to the documents just heard from katie so that was very helpful consultation available to the public on the 12th of march this is now subject to when the um final sign off but this is the plan if the final sign-offs on the fourth the period for making submissions uh running through to the 18th of april and for people who wish to opportunities are then provided to present oral submissions and oral submissions being heard between the 3rd and the 19th of may and then all going well uh the council meeting and confirming and adopting the long-term plan on the 21st and or the 23rd of june whatever is required um and I think that's the that's the full list so I'll move that and andrew will second it mistake it's a 2021 indian wednesday 2020 question oh well done give that man a chocolate fish that's um that was very good if those time frames change do we just manage that or do we have to rescind that no just manage it that's um just can we approves the following process for uh at the point of formal adoption yeah yeah all right so that's been um sorry if you wish to debate the rating basis and move away from the uagc then that will actually impact on the financial data which and the financial strategy so um you would need to have that debate before you adopt that staff well I didn't have the amendment before the meeting so no I just I wondered whether it was going to be possible to do that um within the time frame but it's just not possible but I mean it isn't the end of the opportunity this is the draft and I'm sure that there will be submissions that will come in on the on the subject and we will have the opportunity to debate that fully in the context of the final adoption of the ltp are people generally comfortable with that approach good so I'm going to adjourn for morning tea and we will reconvene at 11 30. thank you it's probably just as easy to to go around the table and I'll all by by opening up the debate and then closing it I'll just close the debate so I'll pass over to you andrew to kick things off thank you that's great thank you very much indeed um so first of all I'll focus on the um high use water charging the excess water charging which is a high use charge based on a 700 liters a day allocation it's important to note that this is the same flat amount per property um and it's also worth comparing that 700 liters to the 540 litre actual average use per property now we did consult in a on a similar proposal in the annual plan last year and a few people referred to that in questions but there are some differences between what was proposed then and what's proposed now and the key difference between the proposal that we're going out with now and the one that we consulted on last year is that the 700 liter allocation per property is equal and it's in no way linked to the value of the last year's proposal in my view was not this is because in the previous proposal the more valuable properties got a higher allocation of water before the charging kicked in now some have said that this is the narrower end of the wedge on implementing a fully um volumetric water charging system um there was some commentary from from staff and elected members earlier in this meeting around the water reform package that government is pursuing and of course we don't know what that means in terms of ultimate um charging regimes but you know this shouldn't be seen as the narrow end of the wedge on water charging from council um and the reality is this isn't something that we're doing to raise money it's not something we're doing because of the state of the water network it's something we're doing because of the capacity of the network and what we're doing is targeting around 20 percent of the highest users of water who in fact use approximately half of the water that the whole city uses and what the network at peak times of the year summer peak times of the day evenings so that we're not needing to pay to create additional capacity in the network which really shouldn't be necessary so the exemptions will be a key way of this working I certainly support the exemptions including the discretionary exemption been added to allow for any unintended or unfair outcomes to be handled appropriately as was discussed earlier now on a local issue um I imagine the littleton and akaroa communities will have views on the proposal to close service desks in both of those communities but I think the community will benefit from a clear understanding of the current level of use of these facilities not just for financial traction transactions but for non-financial and for other inquiries and the other services that these these desks offer and provide as well um so I expect there'll be community submissions on that but I hope that we're in a position where those submissions can be well informed as to the current use of those facilities on rates um I noticed the consultation given a would have given a different rates rise than the proposed five percent um which when compared to some other councils around the country um compares very favorably in fact yes there are things we could have done that would have seen a lower rates rise in particular discontinuing some capital projects such as the new hornby pool library and service center not opening new facilities such as the linwood pool or closing or reducing the hours of some existing facilities such as libraries community centres or recreation facilities we looked at proposals that would have seen grass cut around community facilities only when it got to be a fire risk reductions in opening hours at council facilities that wouldn't have met the needs of communities we've seen the pushback when we've tried to reduce ours at libraries for example in the past and emptying bins and cleaning streets less often that's not the kind of city I want to live in and I don't think it's the kind of city most of our residents want to live in as someone that loves are provided to a high standard and services are provided to a high standard and rates are affordable so finding the balance and been financially prudent is what all of this has been about and I think we've done that well in what remains a very constrained financial position final point this is a draft that we're putting out for consultation I expect that the community will have views on a number of aspects some of which I've referred to some of which I haven't and I look forward to engaging with the community or more to the point the community engaging with us so that we can demonstrate that making submissions is valuable coming and speaking to those submissions actually adds to the weight of them and that we will listen to what's been um what we're reading and we will listen to what's been said and that can result in change and I'm sure will result in change when we get to the final adoption of this plan in june sorry I wasn't keeping an eye on the time I gave him two and a half minutes of my time so I won't take long I'll just say a few few words I think what we've found obviously you know in a covert 19 environment is actually you know this has taken a lot of work there's been a lot of challenges but I think we've landed actually in a spot that's actually very very good we can put something out to the public that I guess you know meet some of these core requirements that we need to do you know we're meeting some of our you know our fundamental services that we provide and in fact you know when we look at one of the issues that we hear about roading we're increasing as smooth and we're doing in that place also we've found efficiencies savings you know this is actually quite a financially prudent plan we've tried to keep rates as low as possible without actually making the city go backwards because we hear a lot from a number of the communities that we represent's incorporated in this design in this plan but I think one of the things that I find probably the best thing about this is we've repositioned the city you know and we're actually facing one of the biggest intergenerational challenges head on and climate change so I actually look forward to having a conversation with the public getting their thoughts and um seeing where that lands us thanks thank you james as far as I'm concerned the proposed draft ltp has rates increases that are too high they double that of the cpi and the capital expenditure is too much and the operational spend is too great um and finally the level of borrowing is is really in excess of where I think it should be or where I think is prudent um to pick out a couple of elements within this I don't agree with the land-based water discharge in banks peninsula or the capital value heritage charge or the cycleways program in the current form or two brand new suburban indoor swimming pool facilities and I certainly don't agree with the proposed to me the absurdity of striving for equality over equity you know not everything will be even and that's okay so long as it's fair and I don't think that it's fair or reasonable to suggest that someone who has a 2 000 square metre residential property in any area I wouldn't be or shouldn't be using as much water or the same amount of water as someone who has a 50 square meter apartment with no land so I would suggest that the ratepay with the larger land area has already been paying for it in their rates anyway and I think that a blanket cap really is not fair I don't think factoring it by capital value is fair either though and then you would just be discriminating by higher or lower land value areas but certainly disregarding the size of someone's section makes very little sense to me I've consistently suggested that any excess water charge should affect a land mass or section size but in our meetings and work up to this point that hasn't found the crux of it for me we've spent possibly 100 plus hours fleshing this all out and getting it to a point where it's a draft and we've seen where the majority of support has been around the table and from there we then either go down and we go down that avenue and in most cases my view has been the complete opposite so most of the time we've spent when building this draft plan and giving the direction I've put forward that differing view and it's probably been shared by a minority of councillors so you know I accept that but if you can get it to a point where you agree with most of the content or at least a good amount of the content of the draft ltv uh then you would support it um but for me I really disagree with most of it so I won't vote against the process elements of the recommendations but because I'm not comfortable with the proposed direction they'll vote against recommendations three five and six and I'd ask uh jimmy thank you yeah but yesterday the mayor and the most of our councils we attended a 10 years anniversary for earthquake national memorial service so we all you know have a view is one aspect you know we remember all those victims the other one we encourage come for all those family and also most important is we're standing together dedicated for our common future that's most important but over the past 10 years we are all aware not only earthquake we actually we suffer the 2018 the poor heal the the bushfire and also 2019 most attack those events and as well as the kobe 19 pandemic so we our you know environment is a big challenge for us particularly now aware like climate change in back to the 2019 we particularly our council declared now we are the kind of climate and the and also ecological the kind of emergence the city but how to dealing with those issues so long-term plan long-term plan is very very crucial we stand it together you know for our future but but particularly regarding to this one a draft and about but still the consider you know some of the the crucial point particularly like a similar investment for the uh the infrastructure this is still very important like most important one we can attract if the the the people you know come to our church so there's a multi-use arena or even multi-sports facilities but local one like lingua poor and also the the home be the new center this long awaited facility now we need to build up as quickly as possible to meet uh people's the the needs the other one climate change there's a big issue now because in relation to the public transport active mall meaning wise knows the waste it said so I don't think so anyone can you know can make it happen so consultation draft consultation very very crucial so we encourage the community encourage the group including individuals you are repair you are elite eligible to feedback to us but regarding to the rich and past lunch to be proposed this kind of contentious issue we still you know encourage people more figure to thank you um I think the critical thing about today is to put a plan out for our community to seek their views and so I think everyone around this table will have things that they really love in here and people will have things that they really don't like in the community will have things that they want added or changed so today I don't think is really a chance for us to vote against this if we don't go out and consult our community with this budget then um we'll be in a really bad situation so uh today really I think we should focus on um adopting this and putting it out um some of my colleagues have referred to things that they're concerned with I think for me at a very high level what's really concerning still and one of my colleagues has reflected on 10 years on from the earthquake the infrastructure legacy that we face as a city is massive we still have broken roads and broken infrastructure in our suburbs that are languishing and struggling to be need to think about our priorities and hopefully we'll get messages from our community I think it's really telling that in our resident survey um only one in four people so three out of four residents in our survey um are happy satisfied with the condition of our roads and if you walk around some of the areas outside of the central city you see roads that are languishing that are an urgent need of fixing but not only that the cost of not fixing them now as a priority is actually massive because of the reactive maintenance cost and we had a very excellent presentation from someone um from order and wrist not too long ago that highlighted that so for me my biggest concern with this document is there's things like the extra nearly 30 million dollars for the stadium to do all the things associated with it and yet we've still got a massive infrastructure deficit in our suburbs and we need to try and address that balance there's issues such as continuing the development contribution rates funded rebates for central city around fixing our social housing and the other thing I would just like to draw attention to is the huge issue with um the whole idea of our water and I i personally am really concerned with the proposal but the one thing I learned when with the council took out the proposal to charge for rubbish bags is it's much better to have in the proposal um the the thing that you're concerned with rather than remove it and not have submissions on it so I hope that by having it in which is why I'll support it today that people will make submissions in response to it rather than at the end of the process having it added in without people having the opportunity to know that that's what we've signaled so thank you to everyone that's done the work on this I think the key thing is we engage our community and get as many submissions as possible thank you melanie um I've got the completely opposing view to everything councillor goff said I have to say um but um look I'm really pleased um actually with the excess water charge and where we've got to with that I think the flat allocation per household is exactly um right and I'm pleased that we're also going to include the exemption for large families I think that's very important um in a case-by-case basis um climate change we've tried to address it maybe not as much as I would um like so I think I'd love to hear the feedback from the people about what they would like to see specifically and I'm also pleased that we include increase the funding for roading in road smoothing um we've done quite a significant increase there um it's not going to be perfect but it is better than what has been done since the earthquakes also there's been there has proposed a number of reductions to services and also increases to fees um to things that council do that affect families um and for me that it's important the sprayed and cashmere community board is going to be going out and spraydon um and I'm going to go to a number of places where people are where these services are to let them know about the changes because it's often that people don't realise about them until first of july hits so um overall I think we've done relatively well as a as a council working together because the the loss of income that council's had because of covert and the um the dividends that we haven't had has been absolutely massive and we've done our best as a collective but I think there's specific things I want to see um changed and I'm going to be alerting people to those things so thank you catherine um as a first-term counselor this whole long-term plan process for me has been quite an interesting one I personally don't think that we've gone quite far enough in terms of savings and prioritizing our projects in council although no one here is going to disagree that consultation is very important and we're all keen to hear what the public has to bit disappointed in what we're going ahead with with the proposed rates increase I won't be supporting some of the uh items in there but I'll be supporting the process but I just don't think we've gone far enough um I don't think it's fair on the residents to hit them hard when I'm already in a difficult position sam cool yeah thank you I mean uh I'm first I actually can't acknowledge you dawn and andrew for leading us through this process I think um you know from the outset you've been really open and transparent with us all on how we can do this and while we might not necessarily agree uh I've never left a meeting feeling disrespected on sharing my views I do want to acknowledge you both for that I think for me looking at this next 10 year plan it all comes down to a question of priorities and we hear time and time again from our residents that they want those basics fixed and I'm still not convinced that this we're not putting more money into different areas um but I just don't think we're concentrating on the right ones and for me you look at things like the public transport spend you know 96 million over the next 10 years and as councillor goff mentioned around the cycleways don't get me wrong there is a place for that we've spent a lot of money on them already but when our residents are telling us daily that we should be concentrating on those basics I do question whether we've quite got that alignment correct probably the other thing that sticks out for me um and it's you know obviously through the guidance we've offered uh through the workshops it has been really around the capital value um charging and you know I look at the heritage grant or the heritage targeted raid and um you know leon I know that was your idea in terms of that proposal which actually makes sense in a way to try and fix some of the solutions but it just makes no sense to me that should pay a different amount to fix buildings in the middle of town it just it is just not right and so I really hope that our residents do come back and try to address that at the same time look like councillor goff I i do think our operational savings could have gone a lot further and I do um you know I say that in the hope that with our chief executive she'll continue to drive that efficiency over time I know that she will but also around our capital program and you know certainly from the questions we talked through with the staff earlier today was around that prudence level and I'm still just not convinced that the amount we're going out to spend versus what we can actually deliver will be achievable and so if you balance that against everything I'm just not quite convinced that we've got to the point we should have I've been really upfront from the outset my view would have been to setting a rating envelope to really try and minimise that additional impact on again by majority is I guess something we need to question our role as a council are we literally here to drive economic development in the city by spending as much money we take off residents or actually should we leave it with them and try and be effective with the money we already have and I'd be with the latter on that so like a couple of others I won't be supporting it in this form today um but wouldn't stand in the way of the process going out if the majority choose to do so in um so nobody's happy with rates increases but this is not the time for austerity as we've discussed often we must maintain our economic and social recovery post covert councillors and staff have spent many hours a hundred we were told this morning over 100 working together to get this rates increase as low as possible and it's actually um we've done the work it's now time for us to hear back from our residents about what they think um a two 74 cents to maintain our services and the condition of our assets that's what we're proposing a targeted rate for those using more than 700 liters a day sends the message that we must value our water and not take this tonga for granted this extra funding will be used to build and maintain the infrastructure needed to to deliver water to residents similarly our heritage buildings must be treasured and preserved and a targeted rate will ensure this will happen the level of spending and where it's being spent because of the extremely thorough process we've been through to get to what's presented today in this draft ltp will build the confidence needed to maintain economic recovery and is targeted at those areas residents have asked for investment in eg improving roads footpaths without burdening future generations with enormous debt our ce has written at the heart of the draft ltp is promoting community wellbeing therefore community must be at the heart of this process the challenge is always to enable meaningful engagement we must ensure that our fellow residents can make informed comment about what the lga states that this document must be presented in a way that explains the overall objective of the council's proposals for the next 10 years the effect of those of these on rates debt levels of service in a way that is easily understood katie and the cape coms team have done enormous amount of work and have outlined strategies to do all we can to ensure the widest range of community views will be captured e.g those who have english as a second language there will be a tool that has been developed to use alongside the release of this document that will allow communities to access info about how this ltp will affect and impact on their their community their local community there will be opportunities for residents to engage with their community boards to convey their views on what the long-term plan will mean for them I will be attending as many of those opportunities as I can to hear my community's views and I challenge all of my fellow councillors to do the same let's get out and hear what our residents to us instead of with us uh phil thank you everybody um I'd just like to say I've never done an ltp before but um if this is um from what I understand in the past they certainly haven't_''_8568.56 been done it this way dawn's done it in a way that I think it should have always been done it seems to be very transparent I talked to a relation of mine who's a councillor in another district and he said oh you're going to lt plan ltp get scared of it it's it's it's the end of your life but it it has been very good to get right into the numbers you know and I and I enjoy that a couple of things I i do applaud the spending of smooth the money that we've got extra for um smoothing of roads but it is getting confused with just chip sealing versus smoothing itself if we chip seal over a rough road we still have a rough road I would much rather see us do a lesser amount ticking the box of resealing just to keep it get our percentage up we also we need to change our focus away from some sexy projects to general maintenance recent problems in ankara and dentin water tanks are a good example of this rather than only spend thousands of dollars on rather than spend thousands of dollars on maintenance we're faced with large costs to put temporary tanks in over in acura and bypass damaged infrastructure at denton park and so that we and we could ill afford this in this really hot summer that we've we've just we've just come across so um I go along with um jamie and catherine and sam I'll I'll agree to the process but I can't um agree to a lot of it thank you thank you jay uh thank you yeah I'm more than happy to support this today in principle understanding that that's the audit reality that befalls us however I I've signaled a lot of times and and today as well but I am really keen to have a debate should include our existing uniform annual general charges and also the targeted rates we propose to to implement that debate should center on progressive versus regressive taxation on flat versus capital value taxing um however I understand that today because of the financial information um not being ready that that's not possible but I i I'm signaling in in good order and a good time that I do want to have that debate I will be moving an amendment on the on the fourth and um and I look forward to discussing that um aaron yeah um well I'll just start by saying that I think that this ltp should have probably been the most revolutionary that this city had ever seen 10 years on from the earthquakes that all of those repairs should have been done by now the ball hasn't been completely carried the whole way through the journey and there's been too many ups and downs to deliver on where our city should have been by the time covet arrives arrived the constant rate rises uh well beyond the rate of inflation will hurt the economy going forward especially if other councils around put up their rates by an entire quarter in one year the water charging won't get the outcome of lowering water usage uh it just it just won't_''_8776.24 we needed a completely different system for water charging our spending on climate change won't reduce pollution or carbon to the targets that we need to because it's just spending it's not measurable enough it's not it's not outcome focused and our economic recovery lacks clear direction covert for new zealand has been has presented more opportunities and obstacles there is no plan to capitalize on this properly and new zealand has been very lucky through covert we should have taken this opportunity to really get a good foothold in global economies because that also creates jobs locally and lifts people out of poverty and our gdp is the lowest of all the main centres and and this doesn't address that in fact yesterday and I'll summarize the prime minister she mentioned as christchurch rebuilds it'll return to taking its place the second largest city we shouldn't be returning to that we should already be there so for the prime minister to say that at the memorial was a little frightening because we are the second largest and we should be going back to the number two position in this country we should be the backbone of the south island and we should be backing up the rest of the nation and so we should all take that as a warning from her speech on tuesday on monday sorry tim um thank you first of all I just want to reiterate council mcdonald's thanks to the deputy mayor and the ceo for the process and our staff it's always difficult to weigh up the um the scales but we have to do that I'm really interested in hearing from our community and as councillor koko said our community board is going out to our communities and key activity areas to perhaps promote some of the issues in their long-term plan more than others but the key is to get that feedback from our residents we heard covert is going to ebb and flow and is beyond our control all we can do is hope that we have some processes in place to manage the fallout from it so I know again I think that our staff have done a really really good job and our city as well the most amazing thing with this long-term plan however is the um the end of the major project from the legacy of the earthquake so in 2024 the multi-use arena will be completed along with many of the others and that I think is the year that we have to start for me we have to start looking at focusing on our communities we talk a lot about communities but when you go out there they are struggling to understand why for instance community parks have been cut all of these things are important to communities while they don't have control over some of the aspects in the eroding we have had nzta almost do a 360 degree turnaround on communities taking ownership of their streets through the innovating streets project and yet it seems to stop here communities and cost council very little and these are the things we've got to think outside the box and I think to be honest and open to our communities we have to get these legacy projects done they will be completed by 2024 and that is when we should really start focusing on our communities thank you thank you sarah thank you ten years ago yesterday I said it was shaken to its core and we spent the day in reflection months later we came together as a city and we shared our ideas for the future residents were clear they wanted a greener more sustainable city with better public transport safe cycling and great public amenity along the river they wanted they wanted great community facilities and our infrastructure fixed we are well on our way there and we need to hold to that vision of a city built back better a 21st century sustainable garden city this has not been an easy ltp it has came off the back of a covert hit annual plan last year where we made significant operational savings and deferred capital spend we've had more time over 90 hours of workshops to go through savings efficiencies and levels of service yes we could have saved more we looked at slashing library or art gallery hours more than we have proposed community facilities maintenance community funding or lowering the maintenance on our roads we didn't make these savings as they would have had a significant impact on our residents the ltp focuses on things our communities are asking us to concentrate our efforts on more in our workshops we put millions on more per year for road smoothing tens of millions more a year on for our water structure something I was arguing for last ltp and was pleased to get on this time and it's starting to get us on track for the climate this is the first long-term plan to include a climate change lens over everything and it won't be the last more work needs to be done and future long-term plans will reflect this some have concerns about the value of acting on climate change and are keen for evidence the evidence is easily accessible including new zealand are clear that the costs of inaction are way higher not only that but national survey after survey run by these same institutions show that kiwis want action now and they don't believe we're doing enough do I like everything about this ltp nope do I think it goes far enough on addressing our climate commitments not yet does that mean I voted against it today no absolutely not opinions vary around the table and that's absolutely as it should be but we have been through this line by line and I'm looking forward to councillors pointing out the operational savings that they think we should be making on top of the 300 million we've already made or capital projects they won't cut and to be clear for the community what these additional savings would mean when it comes to financial prudence and headroom of course our crunch time as a city is around to the stadium which we have been told will be a 2.9 impact on rates we chose not to take their cart and this is where we year after year we make changes sometimes substantial ones based on feedback from our community this is where at is 17 individual representatives elected by our communities have got to over after over 90 hours of workshops but we are only 17 out of a city of nearly four hundred thousand and it is time for our residents our communities to have the essay pauline thank you yeah look I think this is a good balanced document in difficult times um the way I see it is it's basically based on our core business which uh mainly roads and water because people told us that at the last annual plan and through our satisfaction survey so we see 836 million dollars for drinking water supply improvements to our network budgeted over the next 10 years and 55 551.8 million on roading infrastructure big money and big benefits to our people and another facet of our core business is the well-being of the people in christchurch city both physical and psychological they're mutually dependent so provision to provide and maintain libraries pools parks transport choices and key activity areas this is our climate change we have kept very much to the forefront of our recommendations the fact that we are in a climate change emergency uh the strategy for climate change will be released tomorrow for feedback in parallel to this ltp plan and our investment in communities encourages localism reduces large travel times and supports our climate change goals and this plan offers a fairer and more equitable solution to the ways we charge for our services for example the excess water consumption yes the main aim is to reduce strain on the capacity of our network but a consequence is intended to be one of conservation if most water is indeed used in the summer on gardens well then there are choices of plantings and use of mulch which provide huge savings in water believe me and the land drainage targeted rate is more equitable now proposed to be spread city-wide because everyone benefits from less flooding and that makes sense to me so once again I think this is a balanced prudent approach which will keep our city moving our economy buoyant and our people supported we wouldn't be able to do if we paused many projects so I look forward to constructive feedback especially about what people do support like the cycleways program and the land-based wastewater dispersal in akaroa and many environmentally focused 21st century city projects I support this document and budget going out to the people of christchurch to let us know what they think and I also like to reiterate the thanks for the mega hours work that everyone's put into this go christchurch thank you well I'll just um close off the debate I think when we wrote the letter of expectations we acknowledge the journey that we've been on over the past decade it hasn't been easy coming into the role in 2013 just a matter of months after a cost sharing agreement that committed our city to funding projects that it didn't have money on budget for was exceptionally challenging I can assure you we didn't even know how much we were going to get from our insurance that we had insurance that had been changed significantly dramatically just prior to difficult position there was an assumption built into the three-year plan when I became the mayor of the city the one that I inherited that said 400 million dollars would be found as savings there were no savings to be found what it represented was the chief executive's view of what the government would contribute to by way of additional contribution to the um to the horizontal infrastructure spend so the strengthening communities infrastructure rebuild team skirt as it was known 400 million dollars identified in that budget as savings to be found that were never found where did council find the money in its budget to repair after a massive earthquake it took 10 years of our renewals budget and put them into the repair our share of the cost-sharing agreement but that was just for the horizontal infrastructure we had to rebuild a library we had to rebuild we had to commit to a metro sports facility significantly larger than the one that we previously owned at qe2 we had to commit to handing over some of the insurance money that we had from uh the centennial through the list my um people who work with me encourage me not to look back but to look forward but for one moment I just wanted to remind people that what we inherited was not what we expected to find back in 2013 there were a number of decisions that were made that the city has had no ability to influence right from the get-go because of a decision that was signed off in june 2013 and that was the result of the decisions that were taken with the blueprint which actually overrode the share an idea brilliant campaign the best thing the christchurch city council has ever done and I dream of the day when we can genuinely invite our communities to share an idea about um turning our face from the past and facing the future with confidence this is not a perfect long-term plan not by any means but I've kind of in the in the draft the I mean in the letter of expectations I called it uh building resilience for the 21st century and I said that building resilience was about building capacity that means climate change adaptation disaster risk reduction or sustainable community development development and that actually remains very much the focus as we invest for the future so I think we're our cities at a turning point I i would like us to claim uh profoundly as I have done so in the um and the mayor's proposal that I'm putting before you today uh the the um gratitude with which we express our thanks to the rest of the country for coming to our aid when we when we needed it but actually also knowing that we ourselves are going to be able to contribute to the country in a way that is befitting our status as the second largest urban centre in the country this draft ltp does enable our communities to have a real say about the kind of city they want us to be so on that note I will take out uh items um three five and six and so for all of the balance which are the technical um process ones I will put the technical um uh well I'll technical process one so I'll ask people to vote on item three five and six which is adopting the information adopting the mayor's proposal and adopting the consultation document in principle so um and it's probably just as easy if you do a division yeah so just for three five and six five three five and six is that are people comfortable that the other three thank you yes councillor galloway hi councillor golf no councillor hanson yes that's lucky no councillor mcdonald no councillor major okay thank you I'll declare that carried and I'll put the balance of the resolutions um all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much so it's at this point that I will adjourn the meeting to the 4th of march at 9 30 here in the council chambers so the meeting stands adjourned could councillors please just remain for a minute just at the end because uh we had some uh briefings um that we might be in a position to bring forward so thank you you
It's probably just as easy to to go around the table and I'll just invite councillors to contribute I won't bore you all by by opening up the debate and then closing it I'll just close the debate so I'll pass over to you andrew to kick things off thank you that's great thank you very much indeed um so first of all I'll focus on the um high use water charging the excess water charging which is a high use charge based on a 700 liters a day allocation um it's important to note that this is the same flat amount per property and it's also worth comparing that 700 liters to the 540 litre actual average use per property now we did consult in a on a similar proposal in the annual plan last year and a few people referred to that in questions but there are some differences between what was proposed then and what's proposed now and the key difference between the proposal that we're going out with now and the one that we consulted property is equal and it's in no way linked to the value of the property so that means that it's fair and equitable um last year's proposal in my view was not this is um because in the previous proposal the more valuable properties got a higher allocation of water before the charging kicked in now some have said that this is the narrow end of the wedge on implementing a fully um volumetric water charging system um there was some um commentary from from staff and elected members earlier in this meeting around the water reform package that government is pursuing and of course we don't know what that means in terms of ultimate um charging regimes but you know this shouldn't be seen as the narrow end of the wedge on water charging from council and the reality is this isn't something that we're doing to raise money it's not something we're doing because of the state of the water network it's something we're doing because of the capacity of the network and what we're doing who in fact use approximately half of the water that the whole city uses um and what we're aiming to do is to reduce demand on the network at peak times of the year summer peak times of the day evenings so that we're not needing to pay to create additional capacity in the network which really shouldn't be necessary so the exemptions will be a key way of this working I certainly support the exemptions including the discretionary exemption been added to allow for any unintended or unfair outcomes to be handled appropriately as was discussed earlier now on a local issue I imagine the littleton and akaroa communities will have views on the proposal to close service desks in both of those communities but I think the community will benefit from a clear understanding of the current level of use of these facilities not just for financial traction transactions but for non-financial and for other inquiries and the other services that these these desks offer and provide as well so I expect there'll be community submissions on that but I hope that we're as to the current use of those facilities on rates um I noticed the consultation document makes clear that we looked at situations that would given a would have given a different rates rise than the proposed five percent um which when compared to some other councils around the country um compares very favorably in fact yes there are things we could have done that would have seen a lower rates rise in particular discontinuing some capital projects such as the new hornby pool library and service center not opening new facilities such as the linwood pool or closing or reducing the hours at some existing facilities such as libraries community centres or recreation facilities we looked at proposals that would have seen grass cut around community facilities only when it got to be a fire risk reductions in opening hours at council facilities that wouldn't have met the needs of communities we've seen the pushback when we've tried to reduce ours at libraries for example in the past and emptying bins and cleaning streets less often that's not the kind of city I want to kind of city most of our residents want to live in as someone that loves christchurch I want to live in a city where facilities are provided to a high standard and services are provided to a high standard and rates are affordable so finding the balance and been financially prudent is what all of this has been about and I think we've done that well in what remains a very constrained financial position final point this is a draft that we're putting out for consultation I expect that the community will have views on a number of aspects some of which I've referred to some of which I haven't and I look forward to engaging with the community or more to the point the community engaging with us so that we can demonstrate that making submissions is valuable coming and speaking to those submissions actually adds to the weight of them and that we will listen to what's been um what we're reading and we will listen to what's been said and that can result in change and I'm sure will of this plan in june sorry I wasn't keeping an eye on the time and I'll do so from here that's right I gave him two and a half minutes of my time so I won't take long I'll just say a few few words I think what we've found obviously you know in a covert 19 environment is actually you know this has taken a lot of work there's been a lot of challenges but I think we've landed actually in a spot that's actually very very good we can put something out to the public that I guess you know meet some of these core requirements that we need to do you know we're meeting some of our you know our fundamental services that we provide in fact you know when we look at one of the issues that we hear about roading we're increasing as smooth and we're doing in that place also with found efficiencies savings you know this is actually quite a financially prudent plan we've tried to keep rates as low we hear a lot from a number of the communities that we represent what what they like to see and I think that's incorporated in this design in this plan but I think one of the things that I find probably the best thing about this is we've repositioned the city you know and we are actually facing one of the biggest intergenerational challenges head on in climate change so I actually look forward to having a conversation with the public getting their thoughts and um seeing where that lands us thanks thank you uh james as far as I'm concerned the proposed draft ltp has rates increases that are too high they double that of the cpi and the capital expenditure is too much and the operational spend is too great and finally the level of borrowing is is really in excess of where I think it should be or where I think is prudent to pick out a couple of elements within this I don't agree with the land-based water discharge in banks peninsula or the capital value heritage charge or the cycleways program swimming pool facilities and I certainly don't agree with the proposed one-size-fits-all approach to water charging you know this just highlights to me the absurdity of striving for equality over equity you know not everything will be even and that's okay so long as it's fair and I don't think that it's fair or reasonable to suggest that someone who has a 2 000 square metre residential property in any area I wouldn't be or shouldn't be using um as much water or the same amount of water as someone who has a 50 square meter apartment with no land so I would suggest that the ratepay with the larger land area has already been paying for it and their rates anyway and I think that a blanket cap really is not fair I don't think factoring it by capital value is fair either though and then you would just be discriminating by higher or lower land value areas but certainly disregarding the size of someone's section makes very little sense to me I've consistently suggested that any excess water our meetings and work up to this point that hasn't found favor with the majority of council so that's really the crux of it for me we've spent possibly 100 plus hours fleshing this all out and getting it to a point where it's a draft and we've seen where the majority of support has been around the table and from there we then either go down and we go down that avenue and in most cases my view has been the complete opposite so most of the time we've spent when building this draft plan and giving the direction I've put forward that differing view and it's probably been shared by a minority of councillors so you know I accept that but if you can get it to a point where you agree with most of the content or at least a good amount of the content of the draft ltv then you would support it but for me I really disagree with most of it so I won't vote against the process elements of the recommendations but because I against recommendations three five and six and I'd ask that they'd be put separately please thank you yeah but yesterday the mayor and most of our councils we attended a 10 years anniversary for the earthquake national memorial service so we all you know have a view is one aspect you know we remember all those victims the other one we encourage come for all those family and also most important is we're standing together dedicated for our common uh future that's most important but over the past 10 years we are all aware not only earthquake we actually we suffer the 2018 the poor hill the bushfire and also 2019 most attack those events and as well as the kobe 19 pandemic so we our you know environment is a big challenge for us particularly now aware like climate change in uh back to the 2019 we particularly our council declared now the kind of climate and the and also ecological the kind of emergence the city but how to dealing with those issues so long-term plan long-term plan is very very crucial we stand regarding to this one you know I think the this is even it's a draft but but still the consider you know some of the the crucial point particularly like uh similar investment for the infrastructure that's still very important like metropolitan one we can attract if the the the people you know come to our child church so a multi-use arena or even multi-sports facilities but local one like lingua pool and also the the home be the new center this long-awaited facility now we need to build up as quickly as possible to meet the uh people's the the needs the other one climate change that's a big issue now because in relation to the public transport active mall meanwhile slows the waste essential I don't think so anyone can you know can make that happen so consultation draft consultation very very crucial so we encourage the community encourage the group incoming individuals you are repair your elite eligible to feedback to us but regarding to the recent past lunch to be proposed this kind of contentious issue we still you know encourage proper decision thank you yani thank you um I think the critical thing about today is to put a plan out for our community to seek their views and so I think everyone around this table will have things that they really love in here and people will have things that they really don't like in the community will have things that they want added or changed so today I don't think is really a chance for us to vote against this if we don't go out and consult our community with this budget then um we'll be in a really bad situation so today really I think we should focus on adopting this and putting it out um some of my colleagues have referred to things that they're concerned with I think for me at a very high level what's really concerning still and one of my colleagues has reflected on 10 years on from the earthquake the infrastructure legacy that we face as a city is massive we still have broken roads and broken infrastructure in our suburbs that are languishing and I think we need to think about our priorities and hopefully we'll get messages from our community I think it's really telling that in our resident survey only one in four people so three out of four residents in our survey are happy satisfied with the condition of our roads and if you walk around some of the areas outside of the central city you see roads that are languishing that are an urgent need of fixing but not only that the cost of not fixing them now as a priority is actually massive because of the reactive maintenance cost and we had a very excellent presentation from someone um from order and risk not too long ago that highlighted that so for me my biggest concern with this document is there's things like the extra nearly 30 million dollars for the stadium to do all the things associated with it and yet we've still got a massive infrastructure deficit in our suburbs and we need to try and address that balance there's issues such as continuing the development contribution rates funded rebates for central issues around fixing our social housing and the other thing I would just like to draw attention to is the huge issue with um the whole idea of our water and I i personally am really concerned with the proposal but the one thing I learned when with the council took out the proposal to charge for rubbish bags is it's much better to have in the proposal um the the thing that you're concerned with rather than remove it and not have submissions on it so I hope that by having it in which is why I'll support it today that people will make submissions in response to it rather than at the end of the process having it added in without people having the opportunity to know that that's what we've signaled so thank you to everyone that's done the work on this I think the key thing is we engage our community and get as many submissions as possible thank you melanie um I've got the completely opposing view to um everything councillor goff said I have to say um about that um I'm really pleased um actually with the excess water charge and where we've got to with that I think the flat allocation per household is exactly um right and I'm pleased that we're also going to include the exemption for large families I think that's very important um in a case-by-case basis um climate change we've tried to address it maybe not as much as I would like so I think I'd love to hear the feedback from the people about what they would like to see specifically and I'm also pleased that we include increase the funding for roading and road smoothing um we've done quite a significant increase there um it's not going to be perfect but it is better than what has been done since the earthquakes also um there's been there has proposed a number of reductions to um services and also increases to fees um to things that council do that affect families um and for me that it's important um the sprayden cashmere community board is going to be barrington um mall and spraydon um and I'm going to go to a number of places where people are where these services are to let them know about the changes because it's often that people don't realise about them until first of july hits so um overall I think we've done relatively well as a as a council working together because the the loss of income that council's had because of covert and the dividends that we haven't had has been absolutely massive and we've done our best as a collective but I think there's specific things I want to see changed and I'm going to be alerting people to those things so thank you catherine um as a first-term counsellor this whole long-term plan process for me has been quite an interesting one um I personally don't think that we've gone quite far enough in terms of savings and prioritizing our projects in council although nolan here is going to disagree that consultation is very important and we're all keen to hear what the public has a little bit disappointed in what we're going ahead with with the proposed rates increase I won't be supporting some of the items in there but I'll be supporting the process but I just don't think we've gone far enough I don't think it's fair on the residents to hit them hard when we're already in a difficult position sam cool yeah thank you I mean uh oh I'm first actually going to acknowledge you dawn and andrew for leading us through this process I think um you know from the outset you've been really open and transparent with us all on how we can do this and while we might not necessarily agree I've never left a meeting feeling disrespected on sharing my views I do want to acknowledge you both for that I think for me looking at this next 10-year plan it all comes down to a question of priorities and we hear time and time again from our residents that they want those basics fixed and I'm still not convinced that this addresses it not putting more money into different areas um but I just don't think we're concentrating on the right ones and for me you look at things like the public transport spend you know 96 million over the next 10 years and as councillor goff mentioned around the cycleways don't get me wrong there is a place for that we've spent a lot of money on them already but when our residents are telling us daily that we should be concentrating on those basics I do question whether we've quite got that alignment correct probably the other thing that sticks out for me um and it's you know obviously through the guidance we've offered uh through the workshops has been really around the capital value um charging and you know I look at the heritage grant or the heritage targeted right and you know leon I know that was your idea in terms of that proposal which actually makes sense in a way to try and fix some of the solutions but it just makes no sense to me that while depending on where amount to fix buildings in the middle of town it just it is just not right and so I really hope that our residents do come back and try to address that at the same time look like councillor goff I do think our operational savings could have gone a lot further and I do um you know I say that in the hope that with our chief executive she'll continue to drive that efficiency over time I i know that she will um but also around our capital program and you know certainly from the questions we talked through with the staff earlier today was around that prudence level and I'm still just not convinced that the amount we're going out to spend uh versus what we can actually deliver will be achievable and so if you balance that against everything I'm just not quite convinced uh that we've got to the point we should have uh I've been really upfront from the outset my view would have been to setting in a rating envelope uh to really try and minimize that additional've taken again by majority is I guess something we need to question our role as a council are we literally here to drive economic development in the city uh by spending as much money we take off residents or actually should we leave it with them and try and be effective with the money we already have and I'd be with the latter on that so like a couple of others I won't be supporting in this form today but wouldn't stand in the way of the process going out if the majority choose to do so um so nobody's happy with rates increases but this is not the time for austerity as we've discussed often we must maintain our economic and social recovery post covert councillors and staff have spent many hours 100 we were told this morning over 100 working together to get this rates increase as low as possible and it's actually we've done the work it's now time for us to hear back from our residents about what they think a two two dollar 74 cents a maintain our services and the condition of our assets that's what we're proposing a targeted rate for those using more than 700 liters a day sends the message that we must value our water and not take this tonga for granted this extra funding will be used to build and maintain the infrastructure needed to to deliver water to residents similarly our heritage buildings must be treasured and preserved and a targeted rate will ensure this will happen the level of spending and where it's being spent because of the extremely thorough process we've been through to get to what's presented today in this draft ltp will build the confidence needed to maintain economic recovery and is targeted at those areas residents have asked for investment in eg improving roads footpaths without burdening future generations with enormous debt our ce has written at the heart of the draft ltp is promoting community well-being therefore community must be at the heart of this process the challenge is always to enable meaningful engagement we must ensure that our fellow residents can make informed comment about what and lga states that this document must be presented in a way that explains the overall objective of the council's proposals for the next 10 years the effect of those of these on rates debt levels of service in a way that is easily understood katie and the cape coms team have done enormous amount of work and have outlined strategies to do all we can to ensure the widest range of community views will be captured e.g those who have english as a second language there will be a tool that has been developed to use alongside the release of this document that will allow communities to access info about how this ltp will affect an impact on their their community their local community there will be opportunities for residents to engage with their community boards to convey their views on what the long-term plan will mean for them I will be attending as many of those opportunities as I can to hear my community's views and I challenge all of my fellow councillors to do the same let's get out and hear what our residents think us instead of with us phil thank you everybody um I'd just like to say I've never done an ltp before but um if this is um from what I understand in the past that they certainly haven't_''_1488.48 been done it this way um dawn's done it in a way that I think it should have always been done it seems to be very transparent um I talked to a relation of mine who's a councillor and another district and he said oh you're going to lt plan ltp get scared of it it's it's it's the end of your life but it has been very good to get right into the numbers you know and I and I enjoy that a couple of things I do applaud the spending of smooth the money that we've got extra for smoothing of roads but it is getting confused with just chip sealing versus smoothing itself if we chip seal over a rough road we still have a rough road I would much rather see us do a lesser amount of chip box of resealing just to keep get our percentage up um we also we need to change our focus away from some sexy projects to general maintenance recent problems in ankara and denton water tanks are a good example of this rather than only spend thousands of dollars on rather than spend thousands of dollars on maintenance we're faced with large costs to put temporary tanks in over nicaragua um and bypass damaged infrastructure at denton park and so that we and we could ill afford this in this really hot summer that we've we've just we've just come across so um I go along with um jamie and catherine and sam I'll I'll agree to the process but I can't um agree to a lot of it thank you thank you jay thank you yeah I'm more than happy to support this today in principle um understanding that that's the audit reality that um befalls us um however I I've signaled a lot of times and and today as well but I am really keen to have a debate should include our existing uniform annual general charges and also the targeted rates we propose to to implement um that debate should center on progressive versus regressive taxation on flat versus capital value taxing however I understand that today because of the financial information not being ready that that's not possible but I I'm signaling and good order and a good time that I do want to have that debate I will be moving an amendment on the on the fourth and um and I look forward to discussing that further um aaron yeah um well I'll just start by saying that I think that this ltp should have probably been the most revolutionary that this city had ever seen um 10 years on from the earthquakes that all of those repairs should have been done by now um the ball hasn't been completely carried the whole way through the journey and there's been too many ups and downs to deliver on where our city should have been uh by the time covet arrives arrived the constant rate rises well beyond the rate of inflation will hurt the economy going forward especially if other councils around put up their rates by an entire quarter in one year the water charging won't get the outcome of lowering water usage it just it just won't um we needed a completely different system for water charging our spending on climate change won't reduce pollution or carbon to the targets that we need to because it's just spending uh it's not measurable enough it's not it's not outcome focused uh and our economic recovery lacks clear direction covert for new zealand has been uh has presented more opportunities and obstacles there is no plan to capitalize on this properly and new zealand's been very lucky through covert we should have taken this opportunity to really get a good foothold in global economies because that also creates jobs locally and lifts people out of poverty and our gdp is the lowest of all the main centres and and this doesn't address that uh in fact yesterday and I'll summarize the prime minister she mentioned as christchurch rebuilds it'll return great cities we're the second largest city we shouldn't be returning to that we should already be there so for the prime minister to say that at the memorial was a little frightening because we are the second largest and we should be going back to the number two position in this country we should be the backbone of the south island and we should be backing up the rest of the nation and so we should all take that as a warning from her speech on tuesday on monday sorry tim um thank you first of all I just want to reiterate uh council mcdonald's thanks to the deputy mayor and the ceo for the process and our staff it's always difficult to weigh up the um the the scales but we have to do that I'm really interested in hearing from our community and as councillor koga said our community board is going out to our communities and key activity areas to perhaps promote some of the issues in their long-term plan more than others but the key is to get that feedback effect that isn't over it is going to ebb and flow and is beyond our control all we can do is hope that we have some processes in place to manage the fallout from it so I know again I think that our staff have done a really really good job and our city as well the most amazing thing with this long-term plan however is the um the end of the major projects from the legacy of the earthquake so in 2024 the multi-use arena will be completed along with many of the others and that I think is the year that we have to start for me we have to start looking at focusing on our communities we talk a lot about communities but when you go out there they are struggling to understand why for instance community parks have been cut all of these things are important to communities while they don't have control over some of the aspects in the eroding we have had nzta almost do a 360 degree turnaround on communities taking ownership of their streets through the innovating streets project and's surprising when it can change communities and cost council very little and these are the things we've got to think outside the box and I think to be honest and open to our communities we have to get these legacy projects done they will be completed by 2024 and that is when we should really start focusing on our communities thank you thank you sarah thank you um ten years ago yesterday our city was shaken to its core and we spent the day in reflection months later we came together as a city and we shared our ideas for the future residents were clear they wanted a greener more sustainable city with better public transport safe cycling and great public amenity along the river they wanted they wanted great community facilities and our infrastructure fixed we are well on our way there and we need to hold to that vision of a city built back better a 21st century sustainable garden city this has not been an easy ltp it has came off the back of a covert hit annual plan last year where we made significant to do the same this year we've had more time over 90 hours of workshops to go through savings efficiencies and levels of service yes we could have saved more we looked at slashing library or art gallery hours more than we have proposed community facilities maintenance community funding or lowering the maintenance on our roads we didn't make these savings as they would have had a significant impact on our residents the ltp focuses on things our communities are asking us to concentrate our efforts on more in our workshops we put millions on more per year for road smoothing tens of millions more a year on for our water structure something I was arguing for last ltp and was pleased to get on this time and it's starting to get us on track for the climate this is the first long-term plan to include a climate change lens over everything and it won't be the last more work needs to be done and future long-term plans will reflect this some have concerns about the value of acting on climate change and are keen for central banks treasuries across the world including new zealand are clear that the costs of inaction are way higher not only that but national survey after survey run by these same institutions show that kiwis want action now and they don't believe we're doing enough do I like everything about this ltp nope do I think it goes far enough on addressing our climate commitments not yet does that mean I voted against it today no absolutely not opinions vary around the table and that's absolutely as it should be but we have been through this line by line and I'm looking forward to councillors pointing out the operational savings that they think we should be making on top of the 300 million we've already made or capital projects they won't cut and to be clear for the community what these additional savings would mean when it comes to financial prudence and headroom of course our crunch time as a city is around the stadium which we have been told will be a 2.9 impact on rates we chose not to take their cart a proposal we have seen year after year we make changes sometimes substantial ones based on feedback from our community this is where out of 17 individual representatives elected by our communities have got to over after over 90 hours of workshops but we are only 17 out of a city of nearly 400 000 and it is time for our residents our communities to have the essay thank you pauline thank you yeah look I think this is a good balanced document in difficult times um the way I see it is it's basically based on our core business which uh mainly roads and water because people told us that at the last annual plan and through a satisfaction survey so we see 836 million dollars for drinking water supply improvements to our network budgeted over the next 10 years and 55 551.8 million on roading infrastructure big money and big benefits to our people and another facet of our core business is the well-being of the people in christchurch city both physical and psychological they're mutually dependent so provision to provide and maintain libraries pools parks well-being and in overarching all of this is our climate change we have kept very much to the forefront of our recommendations the fact that we are in a climate change emergency uh the strategy for climate change will be released tomorrow for feedback in parallel to this ltp plan and our investment in communities encourages localism reduces large travel times and supports our climate change goals and this plan offers a fairer and more equitable solution to the ways we charge for our services for example the excess water consumption yes the main aim is to reduce strain on the capacity of our network but a consequence is intended to be one of conservation if most water is indeed used in the summer on gardens well then there are choices of plantings and use of mulch which provide huge savings in water believe me and the land drainage targeted rate is more equitable now proposed to be spread city-wide because everyone benefits from less flooding and that makes sense to me so once again I think this is a balanced prudent approach which will keep our city moving our full advantage of crown subsidies which we wouldn't be able to do if we paused many projects so I look forward to constructive feedback especially about what people do support like the cycleways program and the land-based wastewater dispersal in accoroa and many environmentally focused 21st century city projects I support this document and budget going out to the people of christchurch to let us know what they think and I also like to reiterate the thanks for the mega hours work that everyone's put into this go christchurch thank you well I'll just um close off the debate I think when we wrote the letter of expectations we acknowledged the journey that we'd been on over the past decade it hasn't been easy coming into the role in 2013 just a matter of months after a cost-sharing agreement that committed our city to funding projects that it didn't have money on budget for was exceptionally challenging I can assure you we didn't even know how much we were going to get from our insurance that we had insurance that had been changed left us in an extremely difficult position there was an assumption built into the three-year plan when I became the mayor of the city the one that I inherited that said 400 million dollars would be found as savings there were no savings to be found what it represented was the chief executive's view of what the government would contribute to by way of additional contribution to the um to the uh horizontal infrastructure spend so the strengthening communities infrastructure rebuild team skirt as it was known 400 million dollars identified in that budget as savings to be found that were never found where did council find the money in its budget to repair after a massive earthquake it took 10 years of our renewals budget and put them into the repair our share of the cost-sharing agreement but that was just for the horizontal infrastructure we had to rebuild a library we had to rebuild we had to commit to a metro sports facility significantly larger than the one that we previously owned at qe2 we had to commit to handing over some of the insurance money that as well that I i could go through the list my um people who work with me encourage me not to look back but to look forward but for one moment I just wanted to remind people that what we inherited was not what we expected to find back in 2013. there were a number of decisions that were made that the city has had no ability to influence right from the get-go because of a decision that was signed off in june 2013 and that was the result of the decisions that were taken with the blueprint which actually overrode the share an idea brilliant campaign the best thing the christchurch city council has ever done and I dream of the day when we can genuinely invite our communities to share an idea about um turning our face from the past and facing the future with confidence this is not a perfect uh long-term plan not by any means but I've kind of in the in the draft the I mean in the letter of expectations I called it building resilience for the 21st century and I said to prepare for an uncertain future whether that means climate change adaptation disaster risk reduction or sustainable community development development and that actually remains very much the focus as we invest for the future so I think we're our cities at a turning point uh I i would like us to uh claim uh profoundly as I have done so and the um and the mayor's proposal that I'm putting before you today uh the the um gratitude with which we express our thanks to uh the rest of the country for coming to our aid when we when we needed it but actually also knowing that we ourselves are going to be able to contribute to the country in a way that is befitting our status as the second largest urban centre in the country this draft ltp does enable our communities to have a real say about the kind of city they want us to be so on that note I will take out items three five and six and so for all of the balance which are the technical process ones I will the three and then I'll put the technical process one so I'll ask people to vote on item three five and six which is adopting the information adopting the mayor's proposal and adopting the consultation document in principle so um and it's probably just as easy if you do a division yeah so just the three five and six three five and six is that are people comfortable that the other three thank you okay for resolutions three five and six the mayor aye councillor turner yes councillor chen chancellor coco chancellor cotter councillor daniel councillor davidson hi councillor galloway hi councillor golf no councillor hanson yes that's ricky no councillor mcdonald no councillor major councillor mclennan I don't know he is against thank you I'll declare that carried and I'll put the balance of the resolutions all those in favor
Is really just the formal adoption once the audit office auditor's auditor general's report which is required by the local government act is available for inclusion so hopefully we will be in a position to adopt the draft uh ltp today but we do have time scheduled on thursday the 25th of february uh if that is required so the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the draft ltp is published within the agenda and to go through any amendments that have been put forward by councillors depending on the extent of these um we can take a germans but at this stage um I'm not aware of any uh any such amendments um and I understand why we've been through quite a significant process is over a number of weeks and I do want to acknowledge andrew turner who really did the heavy lifting on my behalf in that regard last year and I thank all councillors for the way that they have contributed to the development of the plan that we have before us there isn't unanimity around the table there going through each of the individual activity management plans going through the capital program um looking at the operational expenditure implications of all of those and and receiving reports from from staff who have themselves also put in a significant amount of work and I want to acknowledge that here today as well uh once we are in a position to um to do so so the the first thing that I'll do is call upon uh council officers to present the report uh then we'll have a um a short report from the audit and risk management committee and I'll call on councillor sam mcdonald who's the deputy chair of the audit and risk management committee to present that and then I will be moving the recommendations uh if we need to um but I i think at that point we'll just simply have a debate on the draft and the adoption of the draft enables the process to begin which is which is really to get our communities focused on the issues that we uh need feedback uh from them on so uh and I've completely uh jumped ahead and and forgotten too as the chief executive just highlighted um take the apologies of which we have won uh for um uh councillor daniel so I'd like to move that we accept that second to the sam mcdonald I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carried and there are no declarations of interest recorded so when we
So that from a technical point of view so we come to the the matter of the notice of motion and uh at this stage it hasn't um been moved and seconded we've had the notice uh describing uh mover as aaron kuhn and the seconder is sam macdonald and clause 22.4 of the standing order states that only the mover the time the notice of motion is moved and with the agreement of a majority of those present at the meeting may alter a proposed notice of motion once moved and seconded no amendments may be made to a notice of motion so I understand that you wish to amend the notice of motion requires the majority of the those present at the meeting to alter a proposed notice of motion so um so would can can we get the this is the amendment motion so that the council directs staff to conclude consultation on the project as per the 8th of march date with an additional information session to be held in bishopdale direct staff to meet with key stakeholders along herewood road to mitigate any and probably most importantly direct staff to produce a range of design options for the community boards to consider in public workshops prior to the commencement of the hearings process um so that's that's the the resolution that that you wish to move aaron and you wish to second um sam and so the first uh motion that we will deal with is that the uh notice of motion is able to be that the notice of motion that was given is able to be amended so so and it's them moving and seconding so um the time the notice of motion is moved and with the agreement of the majority so aaron's independently want to move that to enable that to happen then um you need the agreement of the majority of the meeting so is that a debatable motion it's a procedural motion so I'm going to put that motion I'm going to put them it is a procedural motion that the emotion be able to be that the notice of motion as presented on the agenda of this council is been described no and it is a um it is a it is a majority decision of council and sorry I wasn't aware that it was a procedural motion um so I've just been advised that it's a procedural motion so I can't share my view which is um my strong desire for it to carry but uh there I did um I'm I can't I can't I've been told it's a procedural motion I thought it was a debatable motion I didn't know that it was excuse me I do apologize to the meeting but I didn't know that a majority of the meeting was required to change it I thought the mover and second I could change the motion and I felt that considerable good will had been shown um by the two councillors concerned in order to uh provide us with a way forward I have no way to understand orders to ask procedural motion the first two are what staff do anyway I do we suspend standing orders and get people get their questions just get this sorted speech I'm just seeking advice would the meeting agree to suspend standing orders to enable the questions to be asked yes look all right so that's um that that is really helpful thank you very much I'm going to put the motion that the notice of motion be allowed to be amended I'll put that motion and and given that there's controversy on the subject I'll ask that that staff conduct a ballot of the meeting starting with me counselor hi councillor joe hanson yes councillor turner yes councillor mcclellan yes councillor major councillor golf yes councillor mcdonald curie councillor councillor davidson councillor standard yes councillor hacker councillor templeton no councillor daniels no nothing votes forward I apologize 13 votes for the procedural mission and four votes against thank you now we'll open up um debate on thee sorry that that is that sorry that is this fair comment because um I have uh I asked for uh time in order to take advice prior to the opening up of the debate since which time we have accepted that will allow questions might um I'm pretty happy with the first two that's pretty much what we're doing anyhow um and I i do know about the bishop dale why bishop not papa noise obviously there's two community board areas that are affected by this proposal and now we're going to do three drop-in sessions and one of the communal areas are not double very simple answer it was right in the middle of the route but I guess I'd just like to get an understanding of the third point um what is meant by consider um please uh they're good well staff always prepare um uh a range of design options after a consultation process but perhaps if I hand over to lynette would you like to talk about that I would I would expect so my interpretation of that is that we we have a range of options that can be discussed debated and the pros and cons of them can be discussed in a in an open environment so can I just the outcome of the assurance the result is right I just want to get insurance because I'm actually happy with what the process that has been put out it's just actually where there are decision making points that come along this process and I just want to make sure that consider is actually not going to the board to actually getting them to make a decision on whether they accept the design or not I i think it's really good that we involve the boards but it's a metropolitan project so it's important that the decision making actually lies with the committee so to reconfirm some members are all clear this is a metropolitan project it is this council's decision not the community board's decision the committee the committees yeah sarah and jake um just following on from there are we expecting from the consideration um a recommendation or feedback we always bring feedback feedback from the boards this is our interpretation feedback from the boards to us and then we would make a recommendation into the hearings panel and they would understand what the board's views were yeah so a recommendation from the boards um to the hearings panel there is nothing for the boards to recommend too no thanks jake so if consider isn't uh decision making and it's not a recommendation what's the um what's the concept what's the uh what has been achieved what's the concession so I think as as councillor davidson has noted this was probably the process we were looking to follow regardless given that the range of interest so it really just reiterates what we would have probably done anyway but I think what you're seeing as we get to the end of the formal consultation process and as we alluded to earlier on that's not necessary that we don't stop the conversations then what we're now saying is that we would also have workshops with both of the community boards which are open to the public and we would outline options within those and we would take on board all that feedback and then we would do the next steps would be that we would report that to the hearing is a significant change like putting it on one side two lane instead of split across the two sides then you'd actually have to go out for another set of consultations another consultation and that an assessment of that would have to be made through this process as well at the time and staff do that all the time and you would get feedback from the community boards on that as well yes yes so how's that different what would have happened anyway it's it's not equal well I'm just making sure that we're clear that there is no change the uh jake the perhaps the uh operative words in number three are a range of options the uh uh an assurance that it's uh not an option that's being pushed through that there is a range and they are discussed so it's not limited to one that's the main function of that number three it is and I think that's really helpful thank you sarah uh thanks so much um so just weekly I'm just wondering why we I don't want to do is get to the point in you know september august or something like that and that the the councils disagree with staff's interpretation so I'm just wondering if we could check with them over um to see that he agrees with the staff's interpretation of this and that we're not expecting a recommendation or anything from the board just feedback because what I don't want to do is to get into this situation again where the board said well we were expecting one thing um and so I want to be clear that they agree with the interpretation the chief executive has just explained the way it is I don't want the councils to come back and say that's not what we understood the chief executive has answered the question and I do not believe that this process is designed for individual councillors to question other councillors about what the intention is we've heard from the chief executive about what the process um will be and that is the end of that matter now I had answer sarah's question that is around that process when it goes to the community boards and there's various options there if there's various options because the consultation process might come back that the public overwhelmingly want the current design and our boards always said that support what the public say but if it doesn't and then the staff like linux said to us is making changes um and uh listening and then they make some various changes and are then shown to the community board the community board is allowed to say that option b out of those three is our preferred option it's not a decision but they would say that is what that board preferred correct we would make it clear to the hearings panel what the board's views were we realize it's not a binding decision but it is we our preferred option is number b out of that you have except for at that corner when we made it and staff made that really clear that that was that's what we're looking today brilliant thank you because the full council whether the full council listen or not is up to them at the time it'll be the it'll be the um urban development and transport committee which has the delegation for the decision sorry I thought there was a review of the committee structure coming up halfway through the term yeah yeah so that would be so it might be the cheerful thing I just want to know if design different options are presented to the company board company both choose one of them but those one online is different from the current consultation process whether still go to the hearing process directly or still go to the uh the consultation process ultimately I think what the chief executive was saying was that ultimately staff will make a recommendation to go to the hearings panel um so that there'll be there'll be one of the options we'll go through to the hearings panel but it may be that the significance of the change that has been made may mean that there's another consultation process prior to the hearings panel being set really clarified today and by putting in that phrase a range of design options it's crystal clear yeah okay all right well we'll open it yeah okay so I just want to clarify the original notice of motion had immediately suspend that these three um parts to this motion there's no suggestion here that there's any suspension of anything we're carrying on right yeah cool fine all right so um I'll open it up for um for debate um aaron you can open the debate if you want to um and you can close it as well because you're the mover okay thank you um I'll start by uh actually um and I didn't think this would be where I'm starting uh is actually thanking the mayor and the staff for where we've got to today because this has been pretty awkward to get to this point so I will thank them uh for that and for what the staff have been through so far especially um when the design first come out and the confrontation of some of certainly been there and so the staff have had to go through some probably some pretty tough discussions with those um people uh and uh and abusive of anyone is should not be tolerated and uh and so of our staff is unacceptable as well um I uh have had a lot of feedback around this and I do thank sam for working with us today to get to this point um and in the mirror and the staff that helped us before to make some um concessions I'm going to call them because we have compromised to get to an outcome that hopefully the entire table can agree on if the entire table agrees on listening to its community and aiming for an outcome where the whole community can do well out of it and that includes the people that walk and cycle through the heelwood ward the feedback I've had from most people the majority of people who oppose us and that's not everyone but the feedback is that they're not opposed to cycleways and cycling that they do want to see it they seen and like lynnette's made clear to us is that they are listening at the drop-in sessions and they will look at all of the submissions and go well here's some clear examples of where we could be making change because uh that is what the public's clearly telling us um what I did receive last night um and it can't_''_1154.559 be tabled as a regular petition so I'm not tabling I'm just holding it up uh is a petition that was clicked because it only started on saturday from residents who live in herewood road and and it was we the underside asked the mayor and councillors to support the community board notice of motion holding the current and blah blah to lead to changes led by the community this isn't exactly that but 223 people signed this out of 227 one was strongly supportive of the current design and didn't want to sign it the other four had not read the piece of paper and uh majority of these I was told couldn't get it off the purse and herewood road so uh I would ask my fellow councillors today uh let's move through this process relatively quickly and painlessly and we don't need to get into a mudslinging match because we're all going to still get an outcome of a cycleway on hillywood road that will hopefully after this work for everyone because our local community board members and we'll invite the rest of the community board will be at that drop-in session working with the staff to collect as much information before the staff go away and do the work and I don't think you can ask better than that the staff the public have thought that the meeting so far was something quite different they haven't warmed to the current design that well but the staff have made it really clear they were willing to listen to those submissions so yes this will be a little bit bumpy still but I think we can get to a solution that can work for everyone and I ask everyone to support it yeah thank you I just wanted to enter in the don't get to close the debate so I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who I think has shown incredible good will to try and bring things to a position where where we can work with uh both staff and and and community in order to get a good result uh it's it's been very difficult and you know we heard this morning from one of the presenters about the challenges of of the original decision that was made to bring the the cycleway design and consultation forward uh in order to um in order to address the the issue of the intersection early uh in the in the next financial year uh now that we're on a slower track I think it is giving us time to take um to take to take breath and to and to work through uh all of the issues and I i really appreciate the hard work that people have put on to try and achieve that I kind of want to acknowledge the staff I i went out with lynette last well the week road and and it was really good to be able to sit down and hear what those concerns were but also to hear um a staff member that was absolutely committed to problem solving you know not not to hear you know either side of um you know a debate that was out here but actually the specific problems that are being raised what could we do to engage with you and your business and your customer base um to design a really safe um and and good experience um all around so uh and I I'm very much of the view that in a council environment sometimes things get you know the temperatures uh do do get raised we all get emotionally involved in various things and I have from time to time myself but I think that if we if we can take the temperature down and and actually engage in a way that enables people to feel that um they're being listened to and that they can be part of designing a good solution uh that will lead to good outcomes then I think that'm very hopeful that we get the support around the table for this um this resolution uh I i you know I just would like to thank um everyone but particularly staff I know that it has been very challenging in environments when people turn up expecting one thing and it's something else but you've done a sterling job thus far and um look forward to the next step uh pauline yeah thank you I don't really know where to start with this I just think it's the most bizarre um item I've ever kind of been through on your agenda I've been involved in these cycle ways pretty much from the beginning and we've had bumps like this along the way and staff to me have absolutely proved themselves that they are problem solvers that they do care about people they do listen they have repeated engagements they have individual meetings with people they're doing all of that and I'd kind of like to apologize for the fact that we are trying to remind you of your job here that in here today from your um committee sam and aaron saying that he was proud of the papua new parallel that he was proud of the involvement and that process was exactly the same it had incredible backlash from people we got there and your chair also said with the right amount of communication and attitude I'm sure we'll get there we do have communication we do have the right attitude so I'm not going to go any longer because I think we've spent just so long on this um I don't know I would really prefer to abstain from that because I don't think it's there's any relevance to it because you're already doing all of that but I'm going to wait to the end of the debate I'll either abstain or support it but I do want to apologize uh ann galloway uh kiera as a result of this excellent question and answer session this morning particularly with staff and our discussions and deliberations I'm convinced that the consultation for the wings to wheels cycle way as a result of the engagement with the community and the conversations that will be had that there will be changes made to this plan as has happened in the past with other major cycleway projects I am convinced by the statistics that we are presented with almost daily that we have health issues especially with our children due to inactivity and I'm also convinced that unless parents feel that their children can safely walk scoot up or bike to school we will not get kids out of cars we will continue to have traffic congestion and we will continue to poison our environment so I will I will therefore support this amended notice of motion as it will not delay the implementation of infrastructure that will mean that children in this community can walk cycle and scooter to school and cross busy roads safely thank you thank you tim thank you I'm not going to dwell on the process we've got here I think what the the key thing for me is that the um perception is nine tenths of the law and this council on of this decision making and that's what was asked for and I think it's a really clear way to go forward so um it has been awkward but um we've I think we've got to the right right end andrew thank you um this um this is now really simple um could you mute your microphone oh right this is now really simple um certainly appears to be very simple if what we've got in front of us here is genuinely acceptable to the mover and the second and I'm guessing it must be otherwise it wouldn't be there I failed to see why there was a need for a notice of motion in the first place but we are where we are we're debating this much changing notice of motion now this bears very little resemblance to what was originally put forward so the key point and we've just heard it from staff our quote from you richard this is the process we were looking to follow regardless that was the advice we had from staff just a few minutes occur as part of the consultation process that's already underway and that over 500 people have submitted to in good faith what we're doing is reconfirming the existing process and its features this whole thing and the time it's taken has actually resulted in no change the meeting today is allowed and this has been useful for some clarification of the process and I also appreciate and acknowledge the work that's been done resulting in this now much revised notice of motion which is quite different from what was originally proposed so I think the important message coming out today is to encourage people in the community to engage in the process to have confidence it's robust confident that it allows people to be heard with the additional information that's come out of this meeting that confirms it and perhaps makes it a little bit easier to understand and the other thing that needs to come out of it is confidence in the community that the consultation feedback will genuinely be taken into account and can genuinely drive change and we've seen examples and I also want to encourage all of us around this table and around the tables of the two involved community boards to involve community boards to support where we've got to today and to work with and not against the process and to acknowledge the good will that's been shown around this table today and I hope will be shown in the result of the debate that we're having now so given that I was always going to be comfortable with the current process and its ability to be enhanced or added to as necessary it follows naturally that I'm going to be happy to support this notice of motion today that simply reinforces that current process jimmy as one of decision makers I always support clear robust reasonable decision making I'm honest if original loads of emotion I'm not support but these ones sudden amendment but I fully in order to review those ones I would like to support because why this one actually you know two kind of notes emotional move the second amendment is considered no those respect the 500 the other ones have four weeks to go we assume more the the submission where feedback from the other community from individuals so we have to respect all those the people they you know the a large number of people have already submitted that's very important so these the existing consultation process we can see actually is open transparent and also democratic the process the other one is we go ahead particular now amendment we go ahead here you know until the the 8th of march is expiry day so all of the submission has been a feedback then in that time staff engage with key stakeholders along the hello world to try to you know to review any the the area no particular regarding to a design can be improved that's pretty good that's what is my expectation you know we can have opportunity to engage with the affected uh community now can improve that's most important and also the is not take any additional time additional cost so that's why I changed my mind because the sure amin amendment I support this amendment see councillors change their minds based on the clear evidence today and back down on their call to stop the consultation and to back the process already in place so now we have a notice of motion saying let's keep doing what we're already doing so I guess I'll vote for it we spent an hour on questions for a notice of motion that now doesn't exist it's frustrating but I'm really glad that councillors have committed to lowering the heat and working with the community and staff to get good outcomes for residents we know that cycleways are contentious they're contentious everywhere but we also know from experience that once a cycleway is in place and people are getting used to new road layouts that the controversy dies away cycling numbers increase and anyone who has looked at a finished cycle away heading into town during rush hour will see the cues of people on bikes at the traffic lights not only that the percentage of riders who are women biking on our separated cycleways has risen to 40 and the national has seen numbers increase from five to fifteen percent of students cycling to school since the cycle I went in a city is a balancing act where we try to cater for the needs of all and the desires of many just like new roads cycleways are built for expected future demand we didn't see people driving through the fields before the northern corridor was built but now that it's open they're there and it's the same with cycleways no transport project is expected to be full as soon as it opens either that wouldn't be good future planning but build it and they will come and let's not ignore the biggest issue of our time any delay to cycleways is a delay to climate action it's clear from the draft advice of the climate commission that we're going to have to double our cycling numbers in a short time frame and it's also abundantly clear that wakako tati will be directed to make it happen with additional funding we need good plans in place to make the most of these with the shovel ready funding because we were ready for it so let's build a permanent safe cycle way so that those who want to bike can do so without fear and let's get on with reducing our cities transport emissions let's fix the many safety issues raised by residents over the years and make it safer for those in cars as well let's do this once let's do it right let's do it now yeah thank you um I think one of the tragedies of this whole discussion has been that this is seen as a a pro or an anti-cycle way issue in my mind it's not that at all I mean there's a huge irony that one of the biggest concerns has been raised by a place called the copenhagen bakery in terms of cycling that's been held up that that city as a example in the past and councillor kieran has been one of the people that has from the start introduced the whole idea of spending money and investing to get cycleways in our city so how we do things as a council our delegations policy states very clearly council supports the principle of delegating decision making to the lowest competent level this makes best use of the abilities of elected members ensuring the cost-effective use of resources and promoting the development of efficient and effective management I cannot accept that we've got community boards who despite giving feedback don't inspire a single change to a design that goes out for consultation we have to learn from this and we have to improve in how we do things and I think I welcome the opportunity to consider the delegations to the committee and the community boards especially if we're looking at our committee structure because I do not accept just because something's metropolitan that the board should not have a formal right to make recommendations to council or the committee on issues that are of utmost importance to its local community and I think that would help give clarity around some of these issues so I'm supportive of what's being put in front of us I suspect that we would anyway because it seems very obvious from what I've heard uh that people have significant concerns about the proposed design and it's better that we're up front and consider that possibility now rather than wait for the end of the process without making these decisions today so I support what's been put up I hope that we can review and ensure that going forward we get some really good clarity about local decision making and community board input into things like the cycleways so that we can be clear going forward that we don't have to repeat that this sort of discussion so I'm really happy to support uh what's in front of us let's get on and engage our community be open-minded transparent and support our community boards being involved melanie um this will be quite sure um it's clear that um christchurch city council is not behind the death of democracy as some in the public forum tried to suggest this morning but in fact the opposite we want to hear um people's views and consider them in may not always agree with councillors keown and macdonald I think um yeah now's the now with the new um notice emotion that they're presented I'm pretty happy to um go with that because it's absolutely the right thing to do thank you sam yeah thank you very much leon and I want to acknowledge you actually the start you've basically taken aaron and I under your wing this morning to make a sensible outcome of this and I think it's quite disappointing actually to hear a queue a few councillors uh criticize a pragmatic approach to something it would be nice of you guys to get on board with that at some stage I won't mention you by name though sir um they they look I think the the real frustration um you know that someone mentioned earlier on was around the time wasting and you know aaron mentioned earlier on the fact that we have a committee review structure coming through we've had two committees as a whole already this year that have lasted for no more than an hour time at council uh you know we should probably look at that as well look there is changes as a result of this notice of motion and I do take a wee bit of exception and I get the political side of it where people are trying to make out that we've done nothing but the reality is the environment we're in now we had to do this in a public forum our community board was briefed in late november there were no design changes as a result of our outrageous criticism to it and it's entirely appropriate that we have options presented to us for the community board uh to have some form of view on and I think we should take the public along with it um so look I think this is actually a really pragmatic sensible approach um we were never opposed to cycleways much to um you know I think the the the public comments of a couple accountable not a couple two counsellors uh around this kind of stuff and you know the thing is we're actually all about um not wrecking other people's lives and so what this does by presenting options is it allows our community to have a real say and I think it's actually just said that in this environment we've had to do it in such a public way to ensure we get options um and that's not a reflection on the council staff at all it's perhaps a reflection around this council table but like I say I'm really looking forward to the committee review structure as a result of that so thank you again and I think it's been really useful um and and aaron I know you've copped a lot of flack over the last week on this um but it's actually wonderful you've set up your community and this is a really good outcome for them so I'd hate for that to get lost in translation jake um I just wanted to commend the amended notice of motion I think it's a fantastic endorsement of the process that's been it's a compliment to our staff and the it's humbling that councils mcdonald and cuban have done a real u-turn on this one today um and I i think it's it's admirable uh however what's less than admirable is how much time we've spent here today talking about this and actually what a huge waste of rate payers money this has been incredibly disappointing right um would you like to close the debate aaron james sorry oh sorry okay thank you jameson okay I'll go now um look it's good that I'm following on the back of jake because I agree with much of what he said because we've spent a hell of a lot of time going nowhere and I just want to go back though to 2013 when these 13 major cycle routes were were approved by council and I note that not one of them is in the northeastern part of the city and somehow the business to bottle lake cycleway got didn't make the cut but if this is what you have to go through to have one of them yeah nah I'm that I would not have supported the original notice of motion to have an immediate suspension of consultation but I can support this amended no notice of motion um although frankly I don't see how we're doing anything different to what we would have done anyway so as jake says and james says it's been a hell of a lot of time wasted I think we're going to do what we were supposed to do anyway thank you all right thank you look oh you've got quite a bit of what um councillor daniels has said this has actually this is two hours we're pretty much going to end where we we started with actually a consultation process that is robust and working and I acknowledge councillor kewan and mcdonald who actually have listened to the staff and heard what the process is and realized it actually is the right process and we'll continue to do it the biggest actually impact that we have had was that the um urban development and transport committee when when it was decided that actually would extend that's actually allowed more time in the whole process before we get to a decision point to ensure that there is proper engagement it has been disappointing some of the comments that have been made to I think roll up parts of the community and look I really hope that we actually work together to support a consultation project so we get the best outcome and it's interesting because when we talk about community what is the community we're talking about there are lots of different communities when it comes to cycleways there's residential communities business communities there's cycling community school communities and we've got to make sure that we take every one along and listen to them all but fundamentally what we need to achieve at the end of this is safer infrastructure for people that bike that is the goal of the cycleways and we know when we do it properly we build these cycleways people use them and they work so I'm really hoping that actually as we move forward um and we follow a process that we were already of actually fighting against each other this this cycleway goes through two different wards uh the herod and papanui the community board that I'm on has supported the consultation process we have been through um cycleway consultations before and we know that it is bumpy but it works and you end up getting an outcome at the end that actually meets the majority of people's desires you're never going to please everyone you can't but you will please the majority of people um so let's stop banging heads against each other and start working together um for a better outcome so yeah I i think this is good that that going forward if we've got some of these contentious issues the best part I like about item three is a range of designs now if we'd had a range of designs that went out early on it might not have racked up half of those 500 people and we'd get there a lot easier but I think when it's difficult especially when we're thinking about chopping off four lanes down the start say this is what we could do but this is what we might do or throw people with a couple of different suggestions at the start all right aaron would you like to close the debate please um yeah I would actually uh I'll waste some more time because uh like's been pointed out by some of my fellow councillors they've found this a waste of time I haven't and I don't think sam has either because uh this what we're all the time we've wasted on this is actually incredibly important to the people that I represent the people in my ward that are emailing me calling me and texting me all day every single day uh well not exactly but I get several a day on this issue at the moment and and I want to represent them because phil was right if we'd gone out with multiple options we would have had a completely different outcome from the community because to the community it looked like we had an option we're coming out to tell you it within a year it didn't say tell us all the things you want and we'll make a whole lot of changes because it but that's what the staff are trying to do so through the noise hopefully this waste of time today will get us to a point where we can move forward it's not the same process it is not the same process because when it comes back to the community board with various options the community board will have a say and at that point the rest of this city will find out whether this table is full of hollow words on this particular date because they won't be listening they'll go ahead with their preconceived ideas rather than looking at the feedback that the staff will spend hundreds of hours on putting together plans and options and then the council will vote on it and some councillors might dig their toes in and just vote the way they were always going to vote because that's what our council is often accused of but we'll find out maybe the that and hopefully the people of this table listening to our community because for me cycling is important it's not just about climate change it's about people's own personal health you can live longer and have a happier life although some of them I look at they don't look very happy but there are ones that do look happy and and so I encourage people to cycle putting in cycleways is not going to save the planet I just want to clear that up with everyone a number of things will save the planet a change in energy use a change in work structures but having congestion on roads does not do it and that's a debate for another day there's a debate that is a debate for another day I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know any abstentions that's carried thank you very much I'll declare the meeting closed
Thank you uh the next item on the agenda is the um notice of motion uh wheels to wing cycleway now I'm aware that number of councils have got questions so I just wondered if it would be easier if um staff just gave an overarching um sort of a brief presentation on the process that we've already gone through in relation to this matter and where we're up to and you know potentially any any sort of different ways that we could approach things going forward thank you thank you good afternoon um the process we've undergone to date I'll go through that quickly and then we'll then I can talk about some things maybe we could do to mitigate the concerns that have been raised after that the process today uh in june of last year at their annual plan hearing there was a resolution to staff to bring forward funds to undertake the design and consultation of the wings to wheels uh winged wheel cycleway so it said bring forward five hundred thousand dollars of capex from fy26 to fy21 to the major cycle route with the intention of enabling the commencement of construction of the intersection of breen's gardeners in hillywood in financial year 22 as part of the cycleway staff undertook following that stuff got the skates on and developed up the scheme design developed up a scheme design that proposal for a scheme design was presented to the joint community boards in november of last year and as a briefing and uh there was feedback and that feedback was responded to and um and uh via a technical note and um sorry and the staff then briefed the urban development and transport committee on the same route at the same at both the same briefings northeast arc cycleway was presented as well and um the feedback from the boards was discussed with the urban development committee and the memo was circulated following that consultation material was finalized and this was the 17th december staff consultation started in late january needed to in order to allow for the possibility of a hearing before the ltp which by the end of april we're starting to get cut out try and achieve a a hearing prior to the ltp so that we could commence construction in fy22 so we went out the staff went out and talked to a number of the businesses prior to the leaflet drop for the consultation it was only a week prior but this was sort of the first working week post christmas so they did get out and um talk to as many as they could and have arranged meetings with key stakeholders along the route uh there have been two drop-in sessions as was raised by the chairman from pendleton waimari both have been held currently in the british style community centre they have been extremely well attended and to date at nine o'clock yesterday morning we had an excess of 500 it's close to 550 submissions already and we still have four weeks of the consultation period to run and another drop-in session so the two drop-in sessions we've had we've had uh the our estimate is between 150 and 180 at the first one and in excess of 100 at the second one there have been at each of them extensive discussion with everybody that's come in talking through their concerns their issues their understanding and it's been a very very good and very positive conversation we are having a conversation with the community about this cycle and it's been it's great that we are thank you uh sarah thank you I just sorry I did start talk about going forward yes please I just got reminded we have done one thing to mitigate this already um and that um following the committee the um closing date for consultation has been extended by two weeks so it now closes on the 8th of march it was originally closing late february um going forward there's a number of things we could do we we could extend it further um we could have another drop-in session um but the staff um we have given the amount of feedback we've already had we have had to go away from trying to have a hearing prior to the ltp so we are now after the ltp before we will get to a hearing which was quite bit of time in there for us to be able to work with the community boards and with the affected stakeholders down there so that they are clear and understand the design before we put before staff put a recommendation to a hearings panel for a final design so we can it gives us time to analyze all the feedback we get understand those concerns and look at what can and can't_''_360.639 be done to mitigate it because we do have to look at it from a technical and a safety perspective as well so um I anticipate there will be a number of meetings with community boards a number of meetings with stakeholders uh there'll be we could have a workshop we could have we will have briefings before we um finalize our hearings report and the staff will be looking to incorporate the feedback from the boards from those briefings before they finalise the hearings report so that it's very clear what the board's feedback is what's been done or hasn't been done in relation to that and that we sat in on um a meeting with one of the um members of the community uh with you lani and I i got the impression that uh that that there isn't there there will be changes to the design as we go through the process yes there will be um and given the feedback all of the cycleways have had some form of change throughout them following consultation some have been extreme and some have been minor tweaks along the way it all started with the papino parallel and um we we did extra consultation but it could have been not taking out a tree that the community that was earmarked to be taken out that the community raised concerns over us taking out the design was tweaked we didn't take it out so it could be from that level through to actually changing the facility type like we did when we um worked with the community to find a solution along ferry road so this by the end of that we worked so there's different levels of change yes and um is our process fixed on there an alternative process that we could agree to as a council I'll have to divert to my leonard colleague yeah I don't know the answer to the question I'm a trained lawyer and you always train to never ask a question that you don't know an answer to in public but um I'd like to know the answer to the question the uh the the answer is yes the the answer is the uh the hearings panel could be expanded the uh the hearings panel could be a committee does the hearings panel do we have to use a hearings panel in this process is that something that we've already resolved to do I think I'd just like to get a little bit of advice on that and I can answer your questions you don't have to answer it right now but yeah if you could get that please sarah thanks so much um a couple of questions um there was the joint board briefing um and then some additional feedback from one of the boards I looked at the briefing stuff and I can see that questions were raised over the design were any questions raised over the consultation at the joint board briefing the consultation process the consultation process yeah no not my knowledge no and were any queries or concerns about the consultation process raised um at the committee briefing no no okay and subsequent to the um the joint board briefing when you got more feedback from the fenders my murray hereward board was that over consultation over a design um the additional two questions that were raised I've got them yeah just bear with me a second and I've lost them on my piece of paper I only have two um what mitigation was proposed in relation to parking outside copenhagen bakery yeah and uh how can a cycle lane it was broadly how how can we achieve a cycle lane along the median of herewood road okay so it was a design question around the placement of it it was um there was discussion in his um uh community board member cartwright said this morning um there was discussion around cost yeah so we do it more efficiently and yeah that's really good but um at any stage um before sort of I guess a week ago had anyone raised concerns about the consultation process with staff no we had no queries and when it does come to cost um how much have we spent so far on since council passed the resolution to get us to this point since council passed the resolution yeah on this particular joining these up and getting it ready uh we've been working on and off on wengster wheels for a number of years okay okay so on wings to wheels then the root section design request design the stop start and the consultation so far printing printing all of this consultation material we're cranking up close to a million dollars thank you very much jani thank you can can you just help me understand where the process for the cycle weighs both engagement and consultation and decision making is identified because I'm just trying to understand like what's the normal process that we would use for consultation engagement and communications on one of the questions raised this morning was we should be doing a special consultative procedure I've read through the significance and engagement policy and it would seem you know major impact so I'm just trying to understand how we what what the kind of level of transparency is around the process we'll use around our cycle ways in terms of engagement and consultation and also decision making the process we've engaged or the process we've undertaken through this cycle way is no different to the process we've undertaken on every other cycle way and is from a consultation perspective the difference is we started at a point where we had a resolution from the annual plan which we which is different to other projects let's see the process we've undertaken from that point is the same as we've undertaken on every other cycle way and is broadly the same as every other transport project that we do so the idea to have a hearing I'm like because you know that's not something we've done for previous psychologists they've all gone so like ferry road was there a hearing panel for that so can I pass it I'll pass that one on to um john in a second however can I just finish the rest of the other one the process is the same as we've done for every other process you also talked about the decision making process for major cycle routes the decision-making process for major cycle rates is defined in the delegations register and a major cycle program has designated a metropolitan project in the decision-making sits with the urban development committee yeah and it is a requirement to brief the community boards and that's what we changed in the last election um so yeah so there is a requirement to brief the community boards prior and gather their feedback and that's what we're doing and this process yeah and and to clarify that's uh in the the delegations uh register for the uh and it's part of the uh delegations to the the udat committee sorry the terms of reference to the udac committee okay and council when we had uh the previous uh committee structure which was the atti committee they had full delegation over the cycleways we treated them as if they were hearing so um they they generally I think apart from one instance that I can recall they have they had their own meeting so a separate meeting with hearings so for purposes it was the same process a hearings process it was just the itty committee was sitting as the hearings panel and making and then they had the delegations to make the decision right but we don't have that committee structure anymore we have a different committee structure so so why wouldn't we do a special consultative procedure on this given that significance can we just pause for two seconds before we answer that I can answer that yep um so um in terms of significance these uh are both um a high significance uh consultation and we have uh consulted in a matter in accordance with that so everything we've done you would expect to see if it was a high significance they're not we special consultative procedure but just pointing out the difference in what we have done in the special consultative procedure are very very small we have um provided access to relevant information we have encouraged people to present their views we've held drop-ins and it's worth noting that we probably we're out longer than we would be if it were a special consultative procedure there is no statute or there's no legislative requirement for it to be a special consultative procedure we provided this advice back to uh david lynch this morning as well okay um so sorry can I answer that if it even if it was an scp the minimum is to be open for at least a month which we are and then we would treat it um as if we had to have hearings which is what we're doing the only difference is a public notice yeah so in technical terms there's actually not much difference in fact it's almost identical so um and just I guess um just having experience with ferry road where we've seen a similar during a process and then we have to go and redesign it significantly and then we I guess we have obligations to go back out with revised plans if they change you know to a certain degree so it seems like for this one that's certainly going to be the case how are we factoring in um going back out to the community with the revised plans and what's the possibility for the community board to be briefed on that plan before it goes back out for consultation so that they could um have their views expressed so as I talked to before we started the questions um we are anticipating having a number of conversations with the community board and they will be briefed before we finalize our hearings report so we will be going back to the community board with what the changes are as yet we haven't quite figured out how we will do that with the community but it will be done as a very minimum every person that can that responds will get access to the updated plans and we will we to show them what those changes are and how we've taken into account there sorry I think I'm kind of not being quite understood it seems really obvious from the feedback we've had already that the current design will have to significantly be changed based on the feedback no I'm not yeah I'm not this is about the process that we've undertaken okay the designs there will be changes to the design through this process and we can communicate that I'm not determining we can't predetermine before we start this or at this meeting what level that will be we will have to make a call as to whether we will have to reconsult or we have to go back out but that's that's that's part of this process you you can go back out for free consultation if you felt that there was such a significant change that there would be warranted that's exactly right but I but I think particularly if you're gonna affect people who you didn't think were affected perhaps by the was so significant and this is common across all kind of things that we do including district plan and everything else if you made a change which which resulted in different people being affected to those who were originally who might want to reconsult but I think it's too early for us as linux said to predetermine whether that's going to be the case are you able to give us a sense of the over 500 submissions today no we haven't_''_1151.44 we've had two weeks we've been open for two weeks we've had a run through them we know there's 500. but I don't know what they think what about the feedback from the community meetings for information so uh the thing is is that I mean I can see I was just trying to find a way forward because I think the questioning's not being helpful in terms of the discussion today we're trying to find a way forward um I know that there's been a lot of publicity around it and you know I've personally been I know the challenges in relation to that street I lived in papua new gui I grew up in that area I know it really well and solutions are you know problem solving is actually what the focus has got to be but what I'm hearing from staff is that this isn't the be or end all it's a starter for ten um I mean a significant amount of work has gone into developing a starter for ten but essentially they are now in listening mode and working with the stakeholders in the community mode um there can't have been an assessment done of 540 submissions in the two weeks that they've started to come in if it's helpful to the council there have been very in-depth and very detailed discussions with the community we've had a lot of staff involved in these drop-in sessions they've been great discussions that have yes they have got heated at times but they are a good discussion about the bishop dale and he would communicate in papua new guinea communities and importantly uh councillor as have no doubt there will be a significant number of more people who will be bringing their ideas forward and their comments so it would be wrong for staff to pre-determine that at this stage but just in terms of I guess what I was trying to understand is who would make the decision that the plans should be revised and go up if if we're having a hearing we don't know who's on that panel is the suggestion that it comes back to the transport committee at this stage as I understood it staff have said that the matter will go back to both of the community boards and I guess my question on top of that would be is that able to be done in an open workshop sort of environment so that the public can see what the community board's being briefed on and and and and take that into account um yes and I think the important thing to note is even when the consultation closes that that doesn't mean that the conversations stop with effective parties including elected representatives so a number of people who we continue the conversation on with and that's been the way we work all our transport projects it's not unique to this it's simply just what we do but a hearings process is quite different there's so that's what's there particularly key stakeholders down the hereward road route and it seems to me that we've got until now at least august before even a consideration is given to setting up a hearings panel so I mean in a way that's that that that's the comfort that I've been seeking in this regard is just an understanding that there is there are many steps to go before anyone needs to um you know consider anything as a as in a position to go forward because at this stage we haven't got a plan that's in a position to go go forward that's great but um I have jimmy and then I've got um tim thank you man two questions first one uh still one time to go the other one is 550 existing consultation process of increased community awareness and also increased engagement with effective communities during the next four weeks the staff have any kind of practical methodology can improve encourage more the submission and feedback to the council for the next four weeks so what we what we are doing for the next four weeks is is meeting with key stakeholders including many of the schools I know that staff are meeting with hughwood school in the next few days we're looking to meet papua new high we're talking to cotswold there's emmanuel christian school breen's intermediate there's also burnside primaries there's a number of schools along that route we're also looking to talk and continue to talk and we will after it is closed to all of this all of the businesses but more conversations with some of the significant businesses down there like the charity hospital the um aged care centers the mall so there's a number of there's a lot of work that we're continuing to do as well as having the public drop-in sessions and the uh should it be necessary we can organize uh further drop-in sessions uh along the route and our community development support staff are able to work with transport unit and consultation to make sure that happens and to make sure that those opportunities are very very well promoted within the community to capture uh people who might otherwise have missed it so we we can respond quickly okay thank you second question okay and the I'm concerned uh what is the legal advice or legal challenges to the council if assumption no if these notice motion were approved by the council today but we didn't have sorry it's you can't ask us okay I i do want us to um just take our time and just deal with this as as we best can okay tim thank you a nice simple question and it may should be for the move in a second I'm not quite sure but why only the west side of grip from greers road one I mean it seems like so why is that do you know that's something for um well we'll find out sam just a quick one um so we talked about the the community board briefing and then the transfer the udac briefing yeah so after the feedback from the community briefing what changes were made to the design before it went to udat I don't believe there were any because they had been addressed from the briefing they didn't_''_1583.919 whether the staff did not so this the technical recommendation was to not have a central median um that correct yeah so we did go to all the members and there was a discussion about the questions that were arranged yeah so yeah so just because there were no changes afterwards okay so then the the we did explain what we've done around the mitigation for copenhagen bakery yeah yeah so and then that like liam was talking about before with the community board when it comes back would that again be another briefing or would there be a decision-making element to that for the community boards no there will be no decision making element the decision making is sits with the can work through the details but I imagine there'll be a workshop to understand the feedback so it is actually a to-and-fro but staff I believe staff need to take the feedback that they get whether it be a briefing a workshop or whatever those discussions are with the community board and faithfully repeat them in their report and say these are the concerns and otherwise that have come through from the committee uh the community board sorry and this is how we're addressing it or this is why we can't but we should have done that there should be no surprises in that report there will be no surprises in that report from the community board right and so in in addition uh sam the uh I'd be highly surprised if the community board's concerned don't make a submission and uh you know by doing that it's a very good avenue for them to be uh uh to be formally heard and considered in whatever forum or forums eventuate from that no no that's one I just want to clarify whether so that's that's fine thank you yeah I'm just I'm I i haven't got a copy of the attachment you know that that explains why the central medium strip um wasn't wasn't possible but um that I mean that's neither here nor there it's um it's I mean it's obvious it was a very technical um response attached to him which is unfortunate because I mean it is it is something that people have kind of looked at as whether it's um whether it's possible whether they're alternative mechanisms that could allow for that to happen so but you wouldn't be saying that it's completely out of the way no okay so all right um mike and then aaron actually it's falling off from tim's question um but it's for for staff um obviously they're looking to stop the cycleway consultation at one point along an entire route what would that actually impact would that have on the total cycle like could you continue with just a small smaller section effectively stopped the whole concentration on all of it that the resolution will stop all the consultations and and obviously from what I can see the reason why it's greers road west is because that's where the hillwood ward starts that's the boundary yeah so yeah the wrist is actually in the papanui ward okay the other question so stop in this cycle way um and then going through this type of process do you have any ideas of what type of delay that could cause to this project it's a bit of a bit of steadiness probably six to 12 months but but in terms of us uncertainty is is the real um for us delivering our capital program and getting projects underway um stopping and starting has quite a significant impact on time and cost yeah and I guess other cycleway projects um the the standard that has been done is it's designed by technical experts obviously taking into account a lot of factors once that's done it's then goes out for consultation to the with the community yes that's cycle it's always been designed then consult yes aaron you've got a um a couple of questions here the first one is at the drop in sessions do we do an exit poll um which is a follow-on from kind of yani and jimmy's point over the flavor I realized that we and not everyone has seen the return slips coming through but at the drop-in sessions do we do an exit poll to see whether the session has met their expectations like they got because I was getting feedback outside took me 30 minutes to get inside the first one and it was a pretty clear feedback but do we do that no no we don't do an exit poll unfortunately the first drop-in was wrongly communicated on radio I believe as a public meeting rather than a drop-in so people's expectations coming along to that were that there was going to be some sort of presentation in a public meeting it was on all of our collateral that we distributed in the way we promoted it very clearly a drop-in with people invited didn't conduct an exit survey at that point but I imagine people had turned up expecting a public meeting yeah I got the same feedback from people we have never promoted it as a public meeting it was always promoted as a drop-in yeah so the the people coming out seemed to be um uh the flavor was that uh that it wasn't what they were expecting to go to not just that but just the whole way that we communicate as a council with them so we we've done a number of drop-in sessions and we and we have done a huge amount of consultation on transport projects over the years and uh one recently in the same neighborhood and with a recent sort of flavor of community engagement in that conversation and we are very concerned that everybody has a chance to ask questions of staff and understand the detail of why we think why we have put this proposal forward as so this proposal that has gone forward on a piece of paper to go out to public consultation as a technical as a we can design this this is addressing the safety issues you raised the objectives of the project and in the guidelines that we've got to design too that members of the public don't necessarily understand um and don't always make sense to me sometimes but that's what that's the way it is and we put that there we're very concerned that everybody that comes through the door and has a question to ask of us gets an answer to that question a respectful and detailed answer to that question in a r in a in a way that they can understand it and if they don't understand it that we stay with them until they they've had a chance to work through those concerns that they've had and understand them this is not about us trying to change anyone's mind this is just about us trying to provide as much information as we can everyone has a chance and we have very much found that it doesn't happen in public meetings right drop-in sessions like this with a lot of staff there including both of us uh all of us at this table um and a lot of technical staff there and a lot of non-technical staff that can explain the why we're doing this what are we looking to do how are we trying to achieve this what's the process we're going through so there was people there to talk to all of that and we we topped and changed around the room as people needed their questions answered and that's what we did and yes it was a two hour window I was there for two and a half talking to people on the second one or even longer the first one went for longer as well um the worst the hardest part about the first meeting was the expectation of a public meeting and that wasn't met with some people other than that when we started talking about the detail of it you work through it all can I just intervene because I I've spoke to somebody who attended that believing that they were attending a public meeting and when they actually felt so disquieted by that they left so they didn't engage with that one they're going to one of the other ones and I think sometimes when people's expectations about what they're going to have changed I remember this after the earthquakes there were some meetings which were public meetings and they were great because some people would be nervous of asking a question somebody else would ask the question and they'd hear the answer but I found at public meetings that you could say the same thing to a room full of 500 people and have four different versions of what they were told because people were hyped up and and and and angry or fearful or whatever so in this situation having an information drop-in center where people can get their ideas understand what's being proposed and begin a discussion about the concerns that they have well then that's a good thing so um you know I do I feel sorry for staff who've gone down a particular process I want to see how we can write the key stakeholders about the design changes that need to be made because there's clearly some that do need to be made to be taking into account some of the concerns that have been raised so it wasn't a public meeting people's expectations had been raised so that they believed they had to turn up to a public meeting to demand that changes be made and that's not the process yeah and I 100 agree with you there and do feel for the staff that were there especially the first one um because I copped a fair amount of abuse myself um and it took quite a bit of time to get in and people thought I'd voted for it so one guy was about to clock me um and uh and if you didn't grow up on my side of town that's hitting someone um and so it was a very very heightened emotional side of town I don't know exactly so then as an organization are we not looking at the process we go through with the cycleways because we get asked for and as part of share an idea they were one of the highlights and so but we now end up in a situation where it gets very competitive between the public and the council as an organisation and then the staff cop it yeah it doesn't need to be like that I feel like the the community is kind of the meat and the sandwich of all of us and we just need to take the temperature down and we need to ensure that staff can continue to engage with people you know and and and that way we can come back um looking at what the what the result of that process is so I i mean that that's my desire um and I'm I'm hoping that um out of today we can achieve that so but you had another question a reflection if you don't mind in common into this conversation I think the other point is uh people will come up with a concept of an idea and share an idea wrote and we want to have a greener city people would sign up to that principle the reality becomes real when it's in your street outside of your front door and then people sometimes think about it differently than what they may have thought of in a principal terms so and and the strength of the conversations that staff are having directly with the public with businesses with volunteer sector bodies etc is the strength of actually that engagement and I applaud them for that because they are front and center writing people's people are in their faces and they're not backing away from that they're listening and absolutely this organization in the decision-making process whatever scheme it is if it can be technically accommodated if it meets the safety standards and it meets all the things we're supposed to do as an organization then the staff amend the plans accordingly in light of that consultation and I don't want you going out of here thinking that doesn't happen because it does aaron yeah so my next one is around um because there's been a lot of feedback um I don bin so far but to me directly around the removal of the traffic lane that we're taking out an entire lane so my question is is there what other roads which were major art eras I know this has recently had the designation change to minor arterial but it still has more traffic than its neighboring major arterials of 13 and a half thousand vehicles which other roads have had an entire lane um pulled out that have carry that much traffic I'm in is there any in new zealand sorry this could do the conversation today is about the process around the consultation not the design of this yeah and I know we've bought up that you know the community board race and design features I understand what some of the concerns have been raised have been at the drop-in sessions but I came prepared to talk about the process yeah sorry I think the question takes us into a into an area that we're not focused on today we're not focused on no no we're not focused on the design of the we'll go straight to the notice the medians median median option um what we're asking about is about the process going forward so um and and whether there is a process going forward or whether there's a commitment to one that that's that's really what today is about um sarah you had a question sorry it had started my question was going to stray a little bit into the the design stuff so no questions that's right so is it possible under the process so I'm trying to understand a little bit more about what's expected from the notice emotion if it did pass so is it okay to ask the mover a couple of questions or not because I'm I'm going to once we've got all the technical questions out of the way for staff I'm going to have a brief adjournment because I want to understand the answer to my next question okay um before we enter into the into the debate so um we've talked so far about the consultation for cycleways and has understanding that this isn't just the same process that we use for cycleways it's for every transport project roading if the whole lot is that right but every transport project yeah thanks right are there any other questions for stuff melanie and mike oh sorry sorry sorry sorry melanie mike phil and aaron okay I've got three questions one of them being long um the first one is is that um this morning um david cartwright presented and he said that he'd like the community board to be involved during the consultation process so what you've talked about is um you know there after and the workshops and things like that is there a way to have them involved within this next four weeks uh the community the community board could submit honor and that would give them uh kind of into the process but but that formality might not be what's best in terms of sitting down post the process we said you know we'd certainly do that and that could take many forms whether it's a briefing workshop or or community boards whether it's before or after the end of the process I'm not seeing anything which is problematic for us because we are continuing that conversation with all the other key stakeholders as we go through whether that's before the end of the consultation or after in the community board all of the community members and councillors local councillors are all aware of the drop-in sessions they're able to attend it's not it's the same their information sessions there for anyone to come along and and talk to you but it's about us getting feedback and having those conversations about what the concerns are having that if we if we can have them together with that community that's great so the community board can be as involved as they want to during this period um so the second one is just to I just want to make sure I've got all this process in my head so there's a consultation period at the moment you're talking with businesses you're meeting with key stakeholders including all the schools submit or anyone who just comes along to talk about it at a drop in prepared to have additional drop-in sessions um as well so then the submissions are received and it and it closes and then after that period there's the discussions still continue so it continues with the stakeholders and businesses as you talked about um it's you talking about bringing it to open workshops discussions briefings with the community board where public could come along um then all that feedback over a few months will be um fed into a detailed design and then at this stage it's thought that it's going to go to a hearings process which could be the full um udec committee and then um all the feedback will be outlined in the staff rationale will be given and then when it's in the hearing the submitters can then also speak to the hearing yes um including the community boards if they choose to submit which they will so is that correct so far that is correct so far the only bit missing out of there is prior be briefing both community boards and urban development committee so that they know what's going into that report or if we have to we amend it before it gets done before that hearings panel gets done so there's a there's an opportunity to have a final conversation at that process so that we can have that conversation before we finalize our report our recommendation to the hearings panel and remembering then the hearings panel can either accept or the officer's advice reject it or amend it right okay no that's called that that's that and then my third question was um is it true that on july 23 2020 when we had a meeting for the annual plan there was the resolution to bring forward to 500 thousand all of that stuff speaks for itself yeah yeah but that it was moved by councillor david that's we all know what the request I know I'm just asking no the council staff do not need to go and look at it the whole point was who seconds it it will be we we a matter of fact so it doesn't require a comment from staff thank you mike thank you um sounds like it's going to be actually a really good process that's great one of the questions I have is there was a um a flyer uh distributed about the consultation from the um council staff didn't distribute the flight I i not engage staff in a conversation there's a very important question because obviously this is about sorry I'm ruling it out of water if you were referring to a flyer that one of your council colleagues distributed to the community board members well I do know the the flyer that you're talking about I don't want staff to be asked a question on it can you all right I'm just not going to accept it I'm sorry um phil yep um what this was supposed to be done in 2026 is that correct has it not helped you at all that some of us or all of us dragged it forward and made you jump into this consultation process a you would have liked to like christmas christmas hasn't helped the situation the only fact in the in the in the matter is that it is a shorter time frame than we would normally have and christmas didn't help it okay and the other the other question um we said we'd give you 500 grand to go and do it but you said we spent a mill is that over previous years yes and in the long run to develop the route to do all the assessments before that and that was done in 2018 and then annual subsequent long-term plans and annual plans shifted by um program project programs and projects around and very roughly I would hold you to it what what what will the design cost in the long run roughly if we have to go back and redesign it it'll cost a lot more but you know okay but with with people um submitting and doing things there's an outside chance that there will be some design change no no these are these are very very it's not probably the as to whether there's going to be change there is going to be change we've we've had feedback from submitters that have let's just talk to the charity hospital who have concerns about how they can get their vehicles in and out there are changes to the design very very easy minimal changes that we can make that make the world work just so much easier for them and their vehicles and their deliveries and their and their patience and and the people that have to use that space okay thank you will be changes thank you um I've got uh aaron so just um cheers mike and I was I would have been happy to answer your questions I was just being advised that anne has a question I didn't I can't tell so I'm going to come back I don't want go in first after you aaron okay um such a gentleman so is it correct that we've spent a ballpark a million dollars so far why weren't we told that at the start of this when of one area overwhelmingly wanted a set of traffic lights which that's the cost we haven't put a shovel in the ground yet we could have had the traffic lights and kids will be walking to school this year it brings intermediate cotswold we're we're working to the council resolution which asked us to bring forward funding for design and consultation of the wheels to wing cycle way so it brings here yeah I realized because of that project game playing at this table we have to juggle things around a little to get to an end result 20 million dollars later when a million would have sufficed oh that makes sense thank you okay and um anne's question I'll get dawn to read it out um can you speak I'll try does that work no yeah you can hear me great I wonder great thank you I wondered if uh the delays in the in in pushing up consultation in the process is going to put the funding from kotahi or the traffic lights at risk in any way can I can funding from wakakotahi or yeah or the traffic lights at risk for the traffic imagine the answer's no but um any delay in the process doesn't change the funding profile for um the project yeah just delays the process yeah so the answer's no no right so uh oh mike yani if um I'm just curious so if this was to go back and get redesigned to stay to a standard that um obviously was a lot less than what we're currently saying so say cycle lanes is there a risk though that it may not um receive the subsidy because of the cost-benefit ratio not being high enough um but potentially there's always a possibility but yeah um no thank you and I guess when we're talking about the cost so far to date when was this what year was the decision to have a cycle way uh in this area done um yeah community uh so my understanding is a strategic case part of the costs would have gone against us was um reported to council 2013 2014 yeah um the ite committee in 2018 on the corridor and the route selection for this road it's been a number of number of years some of the work uh lastly are the majority of car parks proposed to go in herewood road uh no no no no thank you um yani yeah um I just wanted to check in terms of going out for consultation with options are there options in the consultation document and if not why not um that was a conversation that was had with the committee when we briefed them because they were there are options for different styles of design down there and the guidance from the board was uh from the committee was to um go out with what we've got um right and so basically was so there's been no change from either from the committee or the board from the briefings to the design that was put forward I think said we investigated the option for a cycle way along the middle of herewood road and responded to the board on that and that was responded to from a safety in the committee uh guidance was to go out with a two-way option in the southern end of the road and one way up the middle the sheer path at the top end um and then the I guess the final question is this really seems to be an issue around delegations and so if the notice emotion um doesn't go through or does go through is there a separate process where we can reconsider the delegations like how can we reconsider the delegation it's not on the agenda for today the only people that can I mean this notice of motion another mover in the second so right um if we could just leave that matter for another occasion I i really can I flag this we should do that and I would like to avoid this advice on on the on the um on the two the two issues that are before the council so that people are very clear on what the what the debate is about so but just so just one of the answers we had before is it we'll go back there anything even that's so is there anything that would preclude it going back to the board for a formal recommendation even though that's not explicit in the delegations that would effectively do what the notice of motion is unfortunately the council is not the decision maker in relation to this matter in relation to the the subject matter it is the decision of the urban development and transport committee so as I say I'm go I want to take some of these things offline I want to be able to come back and be very clear with councillors as to the nature of the debate and the decision and what flows from there but I need to have I needed to have this all of the questions um answered technically um and now I need to sit down with legal and just be really clear about what happens next so um I don't think there are any more technical questions I've got sarah and sam so just checking I'm just following on from yanI's one so there's a couple of other rock where we went from casual street to the dog leg that got reconsulted um and that um I didn't get a formal record um and um he'd get expressway fury road the community boards were briefed and gave guidance the community board gave guidance villainwood central heathcliff hegui fury met as it was at the time for repentance shagrap on the consultation um it didn't need a formal recommendation but there was really clear guidance and you're happy to do that again the staff have already answered that there is the potential for going out for another excuse me staff have already answered a question which said that it is possible that they could go out for it my question was over the community board involvement and giving guidance and that's what I already said is not a question for this matter right now so just a really quick one just so I'm really clear in my mind so the the million dollars that's been spent to date of the 500 brought forward you know in that budget allocation resolution how much okay so right okay so we're not sure yet what's been spent to that 500 no that's fine sorry no no no sorry is there um okay that that's all the questions for staff all right no that's fine so it's um almost two o'clock so I'm going to join the meeting till 2 15 and and then we'll come back and we'll debate the resolution thank you you
Say I those clothes say no that's carried thank you very much thank you and now we move to the um waipapa papanui inna's community board thank you very much for having us along today um we don't have any part a's um and we're taking the report as red so we're just going to go through a few highlights from the last couple of months from around our area that first photo there is a picture of some things which were delivered to our um our office in papanoi by the santa claus charitable workshop trust they have volunteers who work all year to create toys um which we we received some to give out to groups in our area and we're really proud to be able to support them financially and yeah it's great to be able to do that at that time of year at the end of last year the board hosted a joint interview get together of the shirley and papanui interagency networks we asked the people present at the meeting to reflect on the year highlights both and it was really good to hear about how organizations were working collaboratively through that time how they were working to communicate with their communities and provide support in new new and different ways so we continue of course to appreciate the work of all those organisations and to support the networking that we facilitate with them another great event that was held towards the end of last year was polyphony um now this is a youth voice art event which is uh run by annaleigh by tuaraho or tatahi and it was over two days at the end of november and the theme this year was raw and real and it was a great opportunity for these young people to share their stories there was photographic things poems writing artwork and there were two evenings which were hosted by the young people and the community could go along and hear the young people speak about their works and um it was really moving seeing what they'd come up with and it was a great opportunity for them to share their art and our board was again proud of them would really took a step up um took it to the next level compared to previous years so that was great to see neighborhood trust has opened the whanau center in nancy avenue this is the site of the former part ford craft shop which is rebranded as the quar phi collective and moved into the city and I highly recommend it for crafts and handmade items the whanau center is now a base for practical support for the community around food for example cv help job seeking and a range of other wrap-around supports for local members of that community it's right in the heart of marijuana and it provides the neighbourhood trust with a footprint for their operations on the east side of cranford street where their main base is west on mcfadden's road john bangma who's in the photo who's the principal of mojo primary school was the guest speaker at the opening and spoke about the importance of the community supports that the neighbourhood trust provides um we've spoken to you before about the great collaborations that are going are involved in running a breakfast club at northcote school five days a week and then on the 11th of december they put on a special christmas breakfast where 140 students were served as well as around 40 whanau there's a picture of two of our community policing team uh there's nathan on the right and I think it's dan on the left um so it's great to have their support and yeah all the groups really came together and it was a cool event to finish the year with in that community the christchurch northern corridor opened in december uh there was an opening event uh some of you might have been there I know um pauline you were there on your bike um the there's still a little bit more work to do around that this upcoming planting season from april onwards there's more landscaping to do and there's a few other sort of minor works happening around the edges of it uh one outstanding piece of work which has to wait till the next asphalt ceiling season is the low there is some concerns in the redwood community around noise levels from traffic on the motorway that's really been picked up by duncan webb as mp for central christchurch who's been lyising with nzta it's it's coming from the nzta section of the project and there's a bit more work being done there so we'll continue to keep an eye on that but duncan's really taken a lead on that in terms of the community response we've also got the new direct buses from rangiora and cairport operating down that road as well and as you'll be aware we'll be talking some more about the downstream area on cranford street with the bus priority trial in the very near future another great event then last year was the pool party held at jelly park this was for intermediate and high school students and it was jointly run with findleton waimari herewood board it was a good turnout there was a couple of youth bands played and the weather was really great so it was cool uh just a couple of noted this year that there were a number of younger and first-time participants who came along to participate in that as usual there was free equipment available and also coaching available and escape competition as part of that and at our last meeting of last year we approved the installation of this wayfinding sign at team shirley road which is the old shirley community center site and this is a project uh this was installed by the green lab but the richmond community garden have a lease to install the wayfinding trail through part of the residential red zone so this is the start of it at 10 shirley road and then it goes um through richmond um connecting people with places and projects in the area including richmond community garden avery house and adventure avenue now this saturday there is a guided walk along the trail and starting at 11 30 at the corner of midway and woodchester streets where there is a new parklet that the green lab have done so if you're interested go along and check that out and that's it from us this to move that the report be received and pauline all right I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no let's carry thank you very much thank you the next is the waihuru spread
Uh there's no declarations of interest
Uh the next item on the agenda is the waipuna ballsville hornby ricketton community board mike mora and helen broughton thank you and um thanks for joining us helen this morning um as you've the error our report I'll take as read there's a lot of information in there that a lot of decisions will be made but unfortunately there's no part a's but previous um board reports speak about events and if you have a look through our report you'll see a number of um of events that we've that we've been holding and um and will continue to so there's plenty of community events over the summer in there in the aboard area which have been very very well attended and um I just um repeat um about the culture galore saturday the 20th of february and every time I mention culture galore it takes me back to um our dear councillor ishwar ganda and did you know I was going to say that because it really is as soon as you said it takes me back to I it's just grown gone from strength to strength to strength and it it is a lovely event so um and um hope everybody comes in and attends that and hello horn be on the 30th of march coming up um that's another um event that's organized by the community in conjunction with the community board but it's a it's a community organized and run event which is really really good and that's going from strength to strength as well and we've got um rickard and connect on the sunday the 14th of march at harrington park and that's a lovely park that we've got of course in in rickardon it's um very well used park but and it's good for events like this it's just a lovely place and we've got um coming up on the 9 30 on the 26th of this month we're having the blessing of kyle park is a as a first step in um in the process of our um south library and southwest leisure centre so that's um really a been a long journey hasn't it jimmy but anyway we've um we've got there and I think this is one of the key things that um that we'll have great pleasure in attending and I just wanted to say also um about the um the south express cycle way there's still there's a lot of um yeah views in our community about that and we still want to um to make sure there's there's still some steps that we need to go through um with that so um just giving you a heads up there that um that's still a work in progress and um helen have you got anything you would like to add yes I'd just add on though on on that express cycle route there are a number of views um it's not it's not completely endorsed by the public um lockheed road and ricketton is one one street that who are opposed I haven't heard from them for a long time so so it may just go away but that's a like a ways in every everything excuse me I don't really want to interrupt because um but I will do it just in case it popped it pops up no no but there are a range of issues that are always having to be dealt with when we're dealing with um these major infrastructure projects and it it happens as a matter of course but but it's not helpful to to to to to to start a discussion around the table I'm not people don't think it mates in front of them they don't that it's not an item on the agenda so let's let's um let's focus on on on some other things because I i thought that you might want to raise the national policy statement um issues that impact on your ward because I know that it's an issue that that was specifically in relation to your ward that I was invited to go and visit the bridgeton area in terms of the impact of um increased intensification and and parking so I just I just issue that you would have raised well I'm I'm I'm happy too I'm happy too but if you're but if your community board if your community board hasn't discussed it but I mean that's what I'm saying is that it's it's maybe best that you use the opportunity of the community boards and the party provisions or or if there is a process that's going on in relation to a particular matter to use that process um to to raise these matters to attention these are more for the issues that that that you really think that ought to be raised in the public arena um from the community board so that the the community of christchurch can see what their community boards are doing okay okay okay um mr chair I think at some stage we should come and speak with you about our concerns about the national policy yes standards imposed by in fact central government but I'd have to have it on on the order yeah and and I'm very keen for us to'll be good across some of the particularly the affected community boards thank you okay but we're still waiting for some further advice from our own staff in relation to some of the detailed elements of it and what the interpretation is going to mean for our own district planning processes but we want to engage the community boards and that's why I raised it as you know there are processes that actually get things moving um rather than um you know just uh casual references in the middle of a report so on that issue madame um you'll call the workshop on it will you yes I will good all right so have anyone got any questions you're happy to move and catherine choose happy to second nice um is there any are there any questions for the chair any comments I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you thank you very much
Thank you we'll start the meeting with uh karakia from councillor galloway I understand a couple of councillors need to leave a little bit early but we should be finished by by then I mean also just to note that uh counselor cough is zooming in I've had no declarations of interest all right should be an apology from james daniels okay out of town I have an apologies now from councillor daniels I didn't have it uh who would like to move that pauline seconded by phil all those in favor hi hi hi carrick
Thank you oh and we've got ann galloway's joined us oh right hello good morning all thank you for your time uh having us along here today um it's my pleasure to be sitting next to bridget williams uh dpd cheer um cool we'll kick it off uh so with the first item that we want to share with um the councillors today is the monavale gatehouse creative arts residence program so in 2018 the board expressed an interest in utilizing the monavie gatehouse for an artist in residence program and for the past two years we've had a really successful pilot with the kerry and lou animators being based at the house staff are now developing a request for proposal process to be open to open the opportunity up for potentially other artists going forward so it's a fantastic program and um yeah it's something exciting to see grow the next one which is a rather hot topic the wings to wheels major cycleway just we've had two information sessions so far and one coming up uh 16th of february at of the misconceptions out there our board is not anti-cycleways our board is pro-safety but we're also after cost-effective solutions and we have a history of this the mayor will recall opening the carlton mill bike bridge where the community board what would have been 2013 and stopped the design process at the time which was being managed by skirt and the board worked with the local uh ewe it was naitahu with the cycle community with uh with all the community and actually produced a fantastic outcome so there is a precedent there that the community board has been able to work uh and been trusted by the council to actually deliver a uh very very successful outcome which was actually put forward I think at the local government conference as a best practice so the mayor will recall that um I'd also like to thank the staff that are attending these sessions um the the meetings particularly the first one very hot in temperament with a number of residents and I just like to compliment them for the professionalism of which they're dealing with people the sandwich but with the right amount of communication and attitude I'm sure we'll get there some of the questions that are missing or the answers that are missing with regards to this particular consultation process is what happens on sawyer's arms road if all this traffic has been diverted by off hereward road and I think that we're a little bit of miss on giving out the clearer picture and obviously there is the north west arc from the cycle the proposed cycle way from the university to uh across to the wings to wheels and on none of the designs that I've seen uh is there any inclusion of where this potential uh cycle they would join uh the the the likely suspect is medicine zev but there doesn't seem to be any form of um indication for this for the neighbours so I'm just aware that this might create a bit of uncertainty with the community and around the intentions of keeping that secret um cool so moving on to the um next exciting thing is the um kohatu reserve regarding the work underway to develop a management plan um rojo kahatu is one of the region's only safe and sheltered fresh water sites and has reached capacity for water sports which is a really good thing but um also that means that we need to explore other options going forward um to ensure this fantastic facility can be um maintained and this is increasing demand for a range of recreational and sporting activities and we need to plan from and manage public and user group access and use so this is something that is being explored through the management plan but we're very excited to have this facility just on that as well with the the new toilets that have been built out there the parks rangers out there are very pleased with the public behaviour historically the site has has had a few issues but there's they report that with the use of the toilets the behavior out there has certainly changed it improved culture galore one of the um our better known community events are shared with our bordering neighbours um hallswood uh hornby park from 12 noon through to 4 p.m uh I think last year there was sort of an excess of 50 odd stools um food from sort of every corner of the world a real blend of flavors fantastic day out a great community uh activity so we encourage everybody to come along I know the the mayor and a number of others were there with a a selfie uh last year so encourage everybody to come along then just just at hand uh one other we've just this morning received um and this is a thank you to the team uh to um uh the people involved our request to have the burnside caretakers building been removed I understand it might start as early as next week so that's information just in this morning so that's fantastic news and I you will all recall I think how aaron referred it to as the the rats jungle gym uh with all those ties we only need to look what happened uh north of christchurch here in embley with those tyres and the in the nonsense that's up so thank you for that excellent well I like that as an example of bringing a matter before council and bringing it to to specific attention and action happening so thank you very much for the role that you're playing mike thank you not a question but I need to make a clarification is it possible to bring back the slide on the the cycleway please uh it very clearly shows on that map there the proposed route for the northwest arc which goes up madison's ave and in the detailed design which actually goes into more closer views bigger scale it actually shows in there the future norwest arc mcr route so it is um clearly detailed in this consultation where the joiners and actually has the reason for some of the design in there for it as well so that information is not being kept secret I'll I'll just clarify what I actually said on the drawings that were provided at the burn side sorry the bishop dale community centre the drawings that you saw and I saw when we were both there of medicines of any adjoining cycleway so just okay we'll agree to disagree that's fine agreeing to disagree um in a public forum is just really helpful thank you uh yani thank you I just wanted to check around the cycleway why your board hasn't_''_492.319 brought a part a and are you supporting the notice of motion we've just had a whole segment on deputations the purpose of the um of the discussion that has been raised in this context is not for you to question what a community board has can can I just just leave it there yeah in terms of going forward in terms of the board's involvement in the site and the proposed cycle they design I'm just trying to understand what exactly you're asking for can you just clarify what you would like as a community board okay so we have a an established proven history uh working with perhaps the papua new parallel for example down rutten street which is a boundary that we share that the community board was involved and supported through the consultation worked that we are asking that that's what you want to do you want to be you want to be able to work with the community and actually take over take back some of the community and the process indeed and yeah where we feel we have not had that ability can we leave this we've got an item on the agenda lately where we're going to deal with this I would like for people just to show a little bit of respect for this process which um there have been a number of issues raised here you've been really clear david that the community board as a whole wants to be involved in the process we're not recycled we're not anticipating the community that's fine that's not for discussion today um but thank you you've been really crystal clear I've got no doubt about that sam I was just going to ask mike are we using these forums now you do not get to ask mike a question during the course of um a discussion around the community board report on reflection I should have ruled the question out of order so I do apologize um did someone else have a question yes a simple question you mentioned a two times publicization how many people turn out a big party two two times the public station one was held on third or february the other one how many people came out oh gosh the first I mean the the staff would probably have to report on that bit obviously there's a qr code and where people were able to sign in I would have I would guesstimate the first time I didn't I i thought that you'd moved on because I thought I was relatively clear about accepting a simple question I'm really looking forward to culture galore I think that um it's a great opportunity for another selfie um and uh given the number of people that get into the background of that it's a pretty awesome experience but it does show that when two community boards combine their resources and work collaboratively across a broader cross section what an amazing event you board and your neighbouring community board because you jointly put money into this and jointly support it I've seen community board members right across the city turn up for culture galore so I think it's it's almost become just one of those must go to calendar events of the year so congratulations thank you well it's not as it's the the staff behind us that that helped put it together so I know I know and it's much appreciated so thank you and I think uh our neighbouring board's got some new signage this year so that's great yeah so would anyone like to move and second this particular motion um sam seconded aaron keown I'll put that motion all those in favor say I suppose say no that's carried thank you very much thank you the next item on the agenda is the waipuna
So the next um the next item on the agenda is the resolution to exclude the public and uh I just wanted to um I'm going to move that that we adopt the resolution to exclude the public seat out on pages 168 to 170 of the agenda and that but I did want to make a note that with regard to public excluded item 12 the intention is and I know that the wording on the current agenda item is otherwise but it is it is my intention to move in the context of the item that council agreed to release this report and the on excluded item number 12 that the council will agree to release this report and the final letter of expectations to the public when christchurch city holdings has received the final letter of expectations and with the approval of the chief executive of the council in consultation with the chief executive christchurch city holdings um and that that was an issue that was raised um and uh and the way that the wording of the original resolution was was that this item wouldn of course there is a process that goes letter of intent to cchl as we have a holdings company arrangement unlike other councils in new zealand we have a holdings company so we see we give a letter of expectations to the holdings company and the holdings company then come back with a statement of expectations which we then discuss with them give them feedback on and hopefully come to a point where we can when we can receive their statement of expectations but at that point we simply receive it rather than adopt it because it is a process that separates that decision to the board of cchl so um so the draft letter of expectations that we're looking at today will become hopefully a final letter of expectations uh which we will release um once we know that cchl has received it and has been able to forward it to its board members and to the appropriate um people that need to see it before it's public so um so I will um I'll look for a seconder for the motion uh james daniels and because it was raised in the deputation earlier around another council doing theirs in public do you and those people are still here do you have an answer for that why we would not do ours in public when another council does the other council is um a direct shareholder um in uh the airport company which I think is is a different issue but I mean I think that we do need to review this statement of intent uh process and that we should undertake to do that um but I i I kind of we have to get the letter of expectations to the the company to cr um christchurch city holdings as soon as possible it's already late we are going to have to indicate to them that we're extending the time for the statement of expectations this was supposed to be sent to them in december last year so and it wasn't it was referred to this meeting so we have to refer it to this meeting it is a it is a um a draft at this stage and wouldn't be had a proper opportunity to sit down and end and and workshop the final content and I've looked at the process that queenstown have adopted by way of a working group that workshops these things prior to a statement of expectations um being drafted so it is a slightly different situation but I think the issue that has been raised is one that requires us to consider whether we can improve the process that we have and I'd like to take the time to get that process right before bringing a process paper back to council to get us on the right track in the future but this letter has to go um now as soon as possible because we are already delayed uh andrew thank you um the the point has been well made the the letter which is in is this a question or a debate oh are we are we in questions well that was a question and I answered the question okay I will ask a question in that case I thought I'd miss the opportunity to do that but I will ask agreed and the report will be made public in the way that the mayor has outlined presumably the voting record could be made public at that time as well yeah yep yep thank you it's fine the minutes of the meeting can be the minute the minute associated with it can be made publicly including the voting record yeah thank you um so I'll open it up for debate um yani thank you um I just want to be clear that I really appreciate the deputation or the public participation that was made this morning but even before that we heard those words from the people of our city I've consistently said that I'm opposed to doing letters of expectation in public excluded I can see no basis for doing it in fact we just heard earlier today that we beat auckland at something in terms of this urban cycleway well guess what auckland does their draft letters of expectation in public with full transparency and I think we should be adopting that process to be best in the field rather than just putting these things previously advised council colleagues that other councils do do it in public previously so I can see no reason why we shouldn't be doing this with transparency we are facing the most challenging times in recent history in terms of the covert 19 impact and the climate change impact on our society and I believe the community deserves to have full transparency around the strategic directions being asked of our holdings company and our ccos this city was once labelled the people's republic of christchurch as an insult and yet that slogan was adopted with pride by the people in our city because we held on to our public assets our ccos and our council holding company is a major part of who we are as a city and as a community so I can see no reason why we should not be open transparent and sharing with our community the strategic directions that we're asking our holdings company to adopt I would also just conclude that the auckland cco report is really excellent in terms of understanding some of the issues and what's really interesting this is the auckland companies I stress said that they felt that they were being transparent and accountable when they surveyed the community it was really clear that the public did not view that and that report notes the correct yardstick is responsiveness to the public and in particular the concerns of the public and that people consistently felt that they were not being listened to that that they were failure to involve local birds early on and important decisions affecting the award token consultation engagement and a lack of responsiveness to complaints or criticism and an over emphasis on commercial considerations at the expense of public good and a lack of transparency there are many lessons that we can learn from the auckland cco review I note that this council in march 2016 asked for a governance manual in terms of how we improve the transparency around monitoring and giving direction to ccho we still have not had that back but I am told it's coming back in february there's a lot of lessons that we can learn and one of the most important is that we direction we give to our companies around remuneration and strategic direction anyone else um andrew and james thank you um the point has been made that the draft letter in front of us today because of its draft form and its confidential nature is not capable of been put into the public arena in that form I think that means that we've got a need to focus on the processes around the draft letter of expectations the letter of expectation and the way that the draft statement of intent and final statement of intent is dealt with um so that we can deal with these matters in a way that best meets the needs of the process and so that we get the best um the best process and best outcome possible but at the same time we do it in the most open and transparent way the interest um certainly should be and no doubt will be in the content of the final letter of expectation as delivered to cchl and I welcome the commitment to put that into the public arena as quickly as possible so that is developed and presented back to council the expectations that we have of our company and that's the important part that the output from this meeting is known as soon as possible so that the community can see what our expectations of the company actually are I then expect that there will be an equal amount of interest in the way that the company responds to the letter of expectations as finalized in this meeting and publicized and then in the final statement of intent and then in the reporting that comes to the finance and performance committee of performance against that statement of intent so I think there's a need for us to review the way that we deal with these letters in future noting the way that this report has been presented today and the time constraints around it but I equally think that there needs to be a good understanding of the processes the transparency and the accountability of all of the parts of this process not just the way that the draft letter of expectations has dealt with and that transfers right through to the statement of intent and then the accountability on the part of the company in the way that it reports back to the finance and performance committee on an ongoing basis once this process is concluded uh james I'm just fleeing that I will abstain from the vote only because I'm conflicted on the item so I can't vote on it no then no that is not correct on this item on the item of um letter of expectation letter of the expectation no sorry on the item of um that the the resolution be adopted uh sorry the resolution around public exclusion and that um the item 12 it's a noting that we're simply noting that we will agree to release the report and the final letter of expectations to the public that's after it's been adopted so it is a technical procedural matter that's fine I guess what I'm saying on this matter we will be conflicted so in the in the four of us when the item comes to the table we can participate in the discussion we it yeah I understand that so I was just flagging it because what this debate is about is in relation to it's not in relation to the the the people talking about the letter of expectations not in relation to the content it is a procedural debate about whether or not the letter of expectation debate is held in public or public excluded and given that I'm not voting on it I will just do what we're told you know I'm not voting on writing a letter to ourselves anyway so yeah I just like that I'm abstaining you you can obscene yeah I mean that's that's your choice uh uh aaron I just request that you put going into item 12 separate please right okay um all right so um so it's been moved and seconded is there any other debate um right so I will um I'll put the motion uh and I will uh deal with the um the section that includes uh item 12 so the the the I'll deal with the vote on item 12 of a separate vote so I'll put that motion all those in say favor say I hey I'm doing 12 first all those in favor say I those opposed say no oh well hang on that um I think it might be better that you just um polled the meeting yes no sorry that was sorry I didn't switch my microphone on so the vote has been carried I'm sorry lost and so therefore we will now move on to item 12 on the agenda and I will but I'm taking an adjournment for morning tea we're almost on 11 o'clock so in fact I'll make the adjournment until 11 15. so 11 15 we will recommence the meeting so thank you very much
Um and if I could invite um the chair of waitai coastal burwood community board to come to the table thank you body and um happy new year um I'm not sure whether it's okay to say happy new year in february but I'll say it anyway since it's the first time I've seen you all I'm joined again by uh christopher turner uh governance man extraordinaire um just to present this report some of which is uh is is from late in the year um of 2020. so just community board um decisions under delegation um we've been approving bus stops um our stock and trade um the one at the most interesting I suppose is outside the palms on the north side of new brighton road I'm just moving that down making a little more user-friendly other restrictions on um no stopping the ascot community centre has been leased to the eastern community sports and recreation group uh very active in our community and um so they'll be uh wrangling people to to use that facility some youth funding couple of very active groups in

community very very active group this again is another fantastic group in our community the south brighton well the bridge south brighton trust they had the agm which I attended late in the year this photo is from the day when the prime minister visited that's steve langrage on the left who's involved in the group they are the ones if you remember who are building a uh converting an old church on the corner of estuary road and bridge street into a truly community uh facility uh they're well advanced in in converting that they're a great group very active very big committee um and and do wonderful work and uh I'm pleased to say that that's progressing well just along the road from the new south brighton um surf club which is nearing completion too so the new brighton community gardens had their agm they've there anything more relaxing than walking around a garden and perhaps therapeutic as well they had over a thousand people come in and enjoy the gardens um they it's a great opportunity for them to raise funds and they they sold a lot of um plants I think 850 plants in three hours um yeah it says here that they uh they sold a lot of seedlings in candula plants which uh confused me a wee bit so I went and looked it up marigolds sorry calendula yeah I knew I'd butcher that um so basically marigolds and they use them uh for all sorts of sort of therapeutic uh remedies um you learn something new every day oh yeah well yes good point um so I love brighton not I love new brighton but I love brighton the brighton area includes those from south shore to waimaari and I'm

people have expressed the desire to see them come back they won't come back on the bridge but there's ongoing discussions with um nzta we're sort of partnering with them to find an appropriate spot for them uh and I suspect it'll be similar to the poppies that are on uh about half a day down the road uh so good to preserve those um that sculpture it's an extraordinary sculpture it was made to sort of rust and then um and then obviously look quite natural so it'll be good to have those back and it's a really positive thing to be involved what we've got next so wax uh the wynoni aventside

christmas parade was held just before christmas um santa arrived by boat um I didn't actually see that but uh apparently he did um yeah a few of the community board members went along and um and we were quite pleased to have uh um a little bit of uh support from councillor phil major who who lent us his um fiat it was wasn't it uh it wasn't your dad's and he bought it before you were even born so probably back in the 1920s or something like that you know yeah so um an incredibly well attended event very full market that day I was really surprised at how many people actually come out with their families uh to to wave at um at the city council and the other floats which were pretty good as well so yeah a beautiful day for it uh really well attended and um there's some photos there uh as you can see so all in all a pretty positive uh time of the year uh in our two wards we have the coast to coast finishing uh this weekend on saturday uh in new brighton so there will be a big sort of festival atmosphere um there this weekend and of course parklands at play so a lot of really positive things going on um the last one I'd like to mention is the continuing success of hapuna taiwana I've had a chat to miran skipper she also sends her personal invite for you to come down and enjoy the hot pools now well ahead of budget um uh there has been she's she gave me some statistics and one of them was like a four percent so they they worked this out from if possible seats so a really good positive I guess inclusion in our area these pools and also you know with the playground if you go down there on weekends and see how many people are down there enjoying that playground you'll be really proud of the investments that you've put into this area so thank you so much and I'll take any questions at this time it's lovely I'm just I'm thrilled about the fronds because um they just have such happy memories for for me from that time so that was sad that the earthquake put page to them being on the bridge but it's great that they're coming back as a sculpture thank you um pauline thank you could I um take the opportunity to just ask you uh how the work is going with the archery club finding a new site is that still alive and well are you still working on that yeah I mean we hear back from uh staff every now and then there's been some suggestions yeah so the um council staff have been working with the club and proposing sort of options of where they could go um and it's something that that comes up around the board table so it's very much front of mind for the community board just to keep that moving along as well just to help the archery club excellent thank you so much cool anyone else mike no question just a comment so I wish you all the best for us the coaster coast this weekend and if you see glenn going up that hill make sure you give him a hand you'll probably be struggling he hits very unrealistic goals but he's a wonderful man all right um james would you like to move that second to bob phil I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you very much david catwright
Petitions um then we have the uh council confirmation of minutes with someone like to move that they'd be accepted uh sarah templeton seconded jimmy chen I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried and now we move on to our community board monthly reports um and if I could invite the chair of waitai coastal bearwood community board
Our declarations of interests uh we have um uh the mayor deputy mayor council of golf and council of templeton um on public excluded item 12 christchurch city holdings draft letter of expectations and also councillors johansson and major for the otahi community oh I'm sorry for the item number eight hearings panel report to the council on the draft community housing strategy um so I've acknowledged those if there are any other items that come up that councillors feel they have a declaration of interest to make they should make those I'll move on to I
And so we moved on to public participation with public forum and could I invite david lynch from momentous public relations limited to make a public forum presentation thank you and I've realized that in the preparation of uh my commentary I've failed to include a specific acknowledgement of a particular piece of consultation that I was involved in where the council actually undertook a process of stalling and proper engagement and if I could seek your um leniency and perhaps standing orders to be uh suspended to allow me to speak a little bit longer I would like to acknowledge that uh before getting into the formal address is that possible sorry I I'm unclear as to what your request is okay my request is simply this obviously you're aware that I've made several requests to be here a deputation that was declined and then the opportunity for public forum however last night I appreciate that on reflection this council has reflected and allowed me to be here today in the rush of preparing for this I failed in my documentation to make a want to hold up and applaud the council for however there are some issues in respect of this other matter so I'd like to seek your indulgence to perhaps have a little bit more than five minutes and I'm aware that understanding orders you can suspend the standing orders no that's amazing it's a resolution of council I don't I don't want to do that okay I'm going an extra an extra 30 minutes or are you talking about an extra minute well what as you're aware I sought two deputations for 10 minutes each no no I'm asking for I'm sorry sorry the deputations were for a notice of motion yes and the standing orders don't allow for reputations on a notice of motion so you've you've you've been invited to participate in the public forum on the basis that you're not speaking to the matter yes um concerned let me put it more diplomatically madame in the past you have allowed public forums to go beyond five minutes I think given the late respect I do not believe your indulgence in allowing me to speak longer is not an unreasonable request and I'd be interested to hear if the other members agree with that or not yeah I have a handout I suspect I can get through this in five to seven minutes five minutes yes um seven minutes is fine thank you okay right I do have a handout which I will gladly have circulated right thank you so much again and thank you for allowing me to speak today in respect of why I'm here I have been involved in some preliminary discussions with a variety of parties that have an interest in this matter and I've also been providing some specific advice to a party in respect of seeking deportation um thank you however for allowing me to speak on reflection in respect of the the purpose of being here however uh before doing so I place on record the fact that my deputation request to address the full council in respect of item six wings to wheels cycleway and information was declined I also of course the public forum but we are here and so I'll get straight into it given the limitations of time to prepare for this public forum I want to address the full council writing the consultation uh council's compliance with its statutory consultation obligations under the local government 2002. regrettably there is a reoccurring and concerning pattern regarding the council's process in respect of council's proposed proposals requiring public consultation it is my understanding that the local government act requires proposals necessitating a public consultation process to be formally ratified by the full council before undertaking public engagement and inviting submissions furthermore the council's consideration of options is required before the council determines its preferences for a particular option prior to public consultation all of these options are nevertheless required to be presented for consideration in the public consultation process when the council does not fulfill these statutory obligations the public can perceive that the proposal is perhaps fair complete a done deal a so-called public consultation have your say to be nothing more than a tick the box exercise where the public can I appreciate that is not your intention but that is a public perception public trust and goodwill can be built up over time by ensuring that there is a genuine commitment by the council to engage with those consulted in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements failure to do so places this council and any council of that matter at legal challenge I now quote an interesting court of appeal I won't go through it all but it simply says this councils must allow sufficient time a genuine effort must be made it is a reality not a charade the concept is grasped uh most clearly by an approach and principle to consult is not merely to tell or present nor the other extreme to simply agree consultation does not necessarily involve negotiations towards an agreement uncommonly I can follow etc etc I won't go beyond that you can read it for yourself when the public perceive that there is no use in participating in the council's so-called public consultation as a result of the council's non-compliance with these statutory obligations we are witnessing a failure today and contacted me last night also this is where we are right now in my professional experience we are facing a death of democracy however in my professional experience I wouldn't be here today madam mayor madam ceo and councillors if I did not believe there is still hope to save this and show some respect and regard to the many people that sadly have had to turn to the media once again out of complete and absolute frustration that for whatever reason there is a resistance to understand that people have a right to be treated fairly and in accordance with the principles of natural justice I'll allow you to read various references I've made but I'll continue furthermore there is an inconsistency evident when one considers the council process undertaken in respect and this is very important the hillwood road gardens road brains road intersection undertaken in may june of last uh sorry 2019 the process there for a smaller piece of work I think was pretty fair and reasonable you sought a lot of information you put out a lot of information relevant in respect of what you're trying to do over a major major difference preliminary advice I have received received strongly suggests public consultation in respect to the proposed wings and wheels should be undertaken consistent with the requirements under the local government act for the special consultative procedure not to do so would suggest this council is operating possibly ultraviolets provisional council feedback I am grateful having attended the uh drop-in center which people thought was going to be a more formal presentation that staff have come back to me and I applaud them for doing so however I am still challenging uh information that mr rainey has sent me in respect to the consultation now for the most important part to you madam ceo I'm submitting the following related questions and these are made to you in accordance with the local government and official information act notwithstanding joe daley has written communications to me on what legal basis was the mayor relying on in her decision to decline my deputation request in respect to the agenda item simply similarly notwithstanding joe daly's written communication uh the same question the third question would you please provide the council's policy setting up the process in respect of the full council's prior approval of a draft proposal before it releases for public consultation under the local government government act number four it appears that the council has failed to meet its obligations under the act to undertake the special consultation procedure in the case of the wings and wheels proposals if she the ceo is satisfied that the full council has in fact done this can she provide the evidence in respect of supporting that view number five given the inconsistencies identified between the public consultation on the hillwood road gardens road greens road mr lynch thank you that's your seven minutes has been concluded thank you and I can see that the additional uh questions have been provided in writing and they will be um answered by the chief executive officer under the provisions of the local government official information and meetings act thank you very much for your time thank you madam councillors for your indulgence thank you and could I now invite sooner sorry friend come forward please thank you for your indulgence to speak to the meeting today and thank you councillors for the opportunity to speak look I'd just like to thank the previous speaker for some of his points they've seen centering around of some of what I wish to speak about but maybe a little bit more clear is what I wish to share with you this morning thank you so look is the recent events that have taken out in our community have motivated me to share some of the things that I heard from the community of herewood when I stood for council and the last local body elections so it became clear to me that vital information was being withheld from the community by a council that clearly doesn't share the information easily or simply for people to access which creates this perception of a lack of transparency that many members of the public are talking about many of whom also knew very little about our consultation process how it works what it's designed to do so I don't think they don't know is happening in a number of cases or they don't actually understand now it comes of little surprise to me that when wills to wings was announced a couple of weeks that many people were left pretty confused and actually pretty fed up with this council many whom that I'd spoken to during the election about wheels to wings weren't even aware the thing was on the long-term plan I asked everybody who is who was in the room here before the elections why is it that you allowed a hundred thousand dollars of hard-earned rate pay money to be spent designing and consulting a set of traffic lines that was quite clear would never be achieved without these cycleways and even further these cycleways were emitted from the design of these traffic lights all this has achieved is more damage to the confident and the confidence that people have in the council and wasted more of their money money of which I'm sure many of the elderly residents in our community could better do within their pocket this week we're and media and amongst many members within the community we're hearing about them being forced recycle ways onto them but actually the real issue is why children cannot ride safely to school and why they can't safely cross hereward road that's the reality that's the real issue and we're not talking about it surely if this engagement process is effective and worked there wouldn't be such strong sentiment in the community about an anti-cycle way or anti-car approach I would request that the elected members here today take all necessary steps to ensure that our current that any current consultations occurring are robust engaging and demonstrates that council offering operating in good faith by taking note of what submitters say in this process and finally I just might add please don't allow the politics that are being played by our elected members to to put back these much needed safety improvements to allow further delay and more money wasted because we should just because they want to play politics we shouldn't allow that to get in the way of delivering decent solutions you scott that's much appreciated um the next is uh kyra foley from school strike for climate christchurch oh sorry you've got someone else with you as well sorry alfie smear sorry it's not written in front of me it's my phone thank you um um I'm alfie and this is kara we're both high school students and members of school strike for climate um we believe climate change should be the forefront at the forefront of all the decisions made in this council and that we believe that making more cycleways will improve our climate our missions and 53.1 of christchurch's emissions in the greater christchurch partnership our report of 2016 comes from transport cycling is an effective way to lower emissions and something that will keep our country within its stereocarbon build goals we have a responsibility to current and future generations to ensure our planet is livable in the future we must invest in a sustainable future for otatahi and the world it is our responsibility and this council's responsibility to make changes now cycleways are a small change the ability to lower our transport emissions and finally it feels like this one should be a given but in 2019 this council declared a climate emergency and although small the development of cycleways will have a big impact on our emissions even the climate commission says we must double our cycling numbers if we are to succeed climate change is an issue we need to move fast on if we do not otatahi as a whole will feel the consequences we cannot afford to delay the planning and therefore the building of our cycleways we are in a climate emergency and we need to act like it we implore you to continue building and consulting on our sideways to move us towards a safer and greener otasahi thank you thanks thank you very much for your time that's much appreciated uh next we have jeffrey king thank you for the opportunity to address the council it's the first opportunity I have had since the last meeting last year when this council approved 21 point something million or maybe 22 million to fix the odor problems at the did not listen to what the council staff was saying they said it

I'll give james councillor james daniels to ogson and welcome everybody to the committee meeting today um so we have uh first off uh two apologies one from james goff and one from anne galloway for absence and we have an apology for lateness from timor skandra who may be here about 10 o'clock and we may be finished with him answering you happy to move seconded by jimmy chen all those in favor say aye opposed that's carried there's no just be mindful of any declaration of interest as the meeting progresses please um confirmation of previous minutes remover for those sarah seconded mike all those in favor say aye opposed that's carrie there's no public forum today we have no deputations today no petitions that brings us nicely to item seven which is the water zone committee's terms of reference and you might remember that this came back to us and came to us in november we had quite a discussion about this ecan have confirmed the terms of reference on the 10th of december and the um this originated because things kind of change along the way with the zone committees that have been in place since I think so I'd like to welcome emma and diane to the table and would you like to just do a brief introduction on where we're at with this please yes so as you indicated um the um the processes has been ongoing for the last year or so and you would have seen discussions again in november about some draft generic terms of reference as well as looking at letters of shared priorities so that was both those items were agreed to at the november meeting since then um ekan has received a report on draft terms of reference which they have adopted the next stage stage of the process is for all of the district councils then to um receive the um those generic terms of reference and go through the same process of considering them and hopefully adopting them and again these are for generic terms of reference they're not specific to it any particular individual zone committee because they refer to there's blanks in the names of the specific district councils etc so these are just generic terms of reference um the the big change between the current terms of reference and the ones in front of you have to do with the zone committees being more on the ground in terms of how they operate and what they do so for example the current terms of reference call for the zone committees to meet I believe it's eight times a year as for public meetings that's been dropped down to um at least four that doesn't mean that they're only do four but they they only have to do four in terms of the terms of reference that allows the zone committees a lot more time to be working with interested parties in the community to do to basically promote water issues within their zones and be a lot more hands-on um and I think I'll just leave it there um if there's any questions or comments right we did have a question around um whether christchurch could have a representative on wanaka for example due to so do your response to that um well as you probably are aware the terms of the current terms of reference as well as the um the new ones um both say the same things in terms of um the territorial authority's representation on the the various zone committees and so it's based on the location of the zones and um the ymcary zone does not include any part of christchurch so um on that basis then we wouldn't have a representative in terms of whether or not there's been a formal request to have a representative as best I know that hasn't that request has not been made to um to ecan and I would imagine it would need to also go to waimakariri if that was a proposal yeah and possibly a better way is just to work through the christchurch west melton zone committee and their relationship with the waimakuri zone committee and and our representative on christchurch we smelt and being james daniels can keep us in the loop about that particular issue that's probably a better way to do as you may be aware the um two or three years ago the y microwave zone committee did an addendum to their zone implementation program which is basically a series of recommendations for issues within the zone one of which had to do with nitrates and groundwater and surface water and those recommendations were passed along to ecan which then used those recommendations to help develop that portion of the canterbury land and water regional plan that has to do with the waimakariri zone so that was part of plan change seven which as you know we did make a submission on there were hearings um on plan change seven in um november and december um they've just been published um the staff recommendations from ecan on the submissions that were received but there has been at this point the hearings are over that the last hearings were I think the first or second week in december um so the um the commissioners have not yet released their decisions so um we're not you know we don't know where where that's going to be yet in recommendations around um rules and and that type of thing it's the zone companies in essence already had their say in that process that's right and again it's been a good process I mean one opportunity could be that we share the agenda and the minutes from the waimakariri zone committee meetings and then that would give us visibility of you know what's coming up on the agenda and then I we were thinking you know then there could be an opportunity to sort of invite you know get a briefing if there was a particular area of interest so that might be a step in sort of a closer engagement without necessarily asking for a formal um representative I think that's the way to go sarah thank you thank you um just checking the um the new freshwater standards did they have to be taken into account as well with the plane change seven hearings because they came out before the hearings yeah that's yeah because it was quite different to what had been put forward in the zipper correct um so the the draft plan change seven went out for consultation that being said um there was um some discussion at the hearings about that so on the one hand my recollection is that the commissioners are would be aware of what those changes are because they are different nitrates to the national bottom lines for nitrates is quite different now under the npsf nps fm 2020 as opposed to the current one um can you tell us what they are that I don't want to memorize just say um are you able to circulate the the staff recommendations being made public yeah they're on there they just were released on on econs okay are you able to just circulate the feedback on the christchurch submission just to us just for our information um there well um I'd have to go through the report and look for for references to the feedback so this is basically this is the staff ecan staff response to what came up during the um the uh hearings yeah to you yeah so it's on like I said the commissioners have not yet keep us updated has they seen just resolutions right oh man well that's any other questions there we sort of wandered off the terms of reference for the zone committee but I allowed that because it was actually good to have that update and uh it's an interesting process um are there any other questions on the design committee terms sam just one quick one so with the meeting and remuneration guidelines around the remuneration for each one um the youth appointments would they be considered appointed members as well that's my understanding so they'd get paid the four thousand as well that's my understanding okay thanks jimmy if the sea waters reform the bill if eventually approved by the government whether these terms reference will be considered revised again or not uh no that's a completely separate process yeah okay thank you second question is regarding to the yellow line part you you point out still the teaching council know any the city council on there so you have the yellow yellow line here um oh okay it's not the silica quite's if it's within the the terms the generic times the reference yeah so so what will happen is um assuming that um each of the district councils approve the generic terms of reference what will happen is then um the specific terms of reference for each zone committee will then be completed yes and where it's yellow where it might say um right now it just says xx runanga for example that will be for each zone committee that will be the specific renong of the specific um district or city councils will be filled in so we'll see those individual ones industry in due course okay okay thank you yes okay thank you so fill in the gap so just and we've just got an additional um it's a bit of a note really there number two and that relates to 5.8 in the on the agenda in page 16. so that just says indicates that um our request to actually be able to have an alternate in the future once we get down to the specific um terms of reference so no move it melanie seconded any debate or discussion all right thanks for the work I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye all right suppose that's carried thank you emma and diane right it takes us now to the number eight item mate which is the um three waters infrastructure environment committee report on the three waters and adam twice welcome to the table I thought this is a very very good report obviously we must thank helen for it as well in her absence yeah certainly yeah if you'd like to give us a quick introduction and anything that may have been updated since this has gone live would be helpful just chuck it in um yeah certainly um I've invited bridget o'brien as well um she's up to speed with the um lead situation just to provide a situation where we are up to within christchurch so would you like to jump into that straight away just so you can provide an update on that before I dive into the twee report sure okay let's do that okay being good to to get a picture of our position with the lead in the pipes so a memo was provided on the lead situation in christchurch in accora and littleton back in november um it's staffed intention to release a new version of that memo an updated version by the end of this week however given the topic I just wondered if you have any questions here and we can provide a quick informal update on that memo now yep so that's okay well sorry apologies for just working on this this morning um so in terms of the previous memo um the memo indicated we're going to start undertaking some additional lead sampling in december january and february of december 2020 and obviously at the start of this year unfortunately that sampling has not started due to issues and staff resources so we have recently experienced issues with elmer's next to reservoir and also transgression events at denton which I'll touch on in the twee report this also coincides with the lack of available resources in the laboratory however speaking to the team was working on that this week with sampling to go um to start on monday the 15th of february um the type of sampling we're going to be doing is 24-hour composite samples which give us a much better information than the typical web samples that have been done to date and just to provide a little bit of background on that the drinking water standards does not require us to sample for lead and the articulation it only requires us to sample in the royal water every five years and all the way through this process we have been communicating frequently with the drinking water assessor as well okay any questions soon just one quick one so in terms of the I guess the lack of resource or the ability not to do it yet um has that been brought forward because of the dunedin situation and I guess if it has what would be the mechanism where we'd have some oversight over that work not being completed there might be a question for carol potentially but uh unfortunately it's just the time of the year amount of extra drinking water samples we've been doing for the new water safety plans that have been submitted so a lot of extra work has gone into that um but particularly with the recent transgressions on those um two sub two reservoirs and suction tank is what's taking our attention away a bit yeah but we had planned on doing the sampling from 2019 and we just haven't had the staff to do it it's just being we're just too busy doing other stuff it just gets head kept falling to the bottom of the list but obviously with dunedin it's brought it back up into sharp focus again so what what's the way in which that's feedback to us I guess is it through this report on a regular basis saying we haven't yet completed it it would be yeah yeah and as adam said we're going to be um sending you an updated uh fully um fully informed memo to you um by the end of the week yeah okay so in the there's a lot around and you're going to update it on the website but it says here there's less than three percent of our uh networkers has lead in it um and if you look there's a map too and it's they're very intensely located obviously in the older part of christchurch in the in the city which is probably could be a good thing in a way if you're going to replace them all yeah so it's three percent overall but it's 19 in littleton so littleton's the um the worst case yeah so most of it in littleton yeah so it's basically you know you think about where the parts of town that have got the really old houses in yeah that's right yeah so there's bits of it in the city as well in the in the older suburbs but primarily at littleton's the and so would that be the priority areas for testing then for this one staff member that's going to launch off on monday uh yes I should think so yeah well how was a three month program was identified in the memo right yeah thanks sarah thank you I mean you mentioned that the work hasn't happened because of resourcing and I know we've had like staffing freezes and a whole range of other bits and pieces um if there was uh more resourcing put in place by council laws would that work be able to happen more quickly yeah it'd be helpful yeah okay thank you james so sorry just done that we have got two extra resources in the laboratory but just to try and maintain the number of samples that we've got at this moment in time but this is still regarded as bothers extra above to that picture please we just hear that yes can you blow that up look I've got it is it my time yes yes I've got a question I'm not sure if it's appropriate for now but that's interesting about the lead pipes and where they are and I just noticed that the coastal lambour primarily burwood wards don't have many possibly because but there is one that goes when I saw it and we're trying to find it on the map now there's one that goes across I think it's new brighton road or bower the bauer bridge or the new brighton bridge and that looks like it's the only one over that side of town wouldn't it be good to get that fixed so that there's no risk of lead infused water going through there so to answer your question about why there aren't any over in the east it's because these pipes are pre-1930s_:_2243.24 so they're cast iron pipes and they were joined with lead joints um so I imagine that that area developed after the 1930s which is why you haven't got those older ones and I think I mean we just have to prioritize so what we're doing is measuring the concentrations and then prioritizing the pipes but the ones of most concern are the ones where we've got dead ends so where the water's going to um stagnate in the pipe and the lead one going over the bower if that's the bauer road bridge um you know it would be reasonably well flushed um but we just need to make sure that we're getting around and sampling them all yeah yeah I guess I get that as a response yeah and I appreciate that um there are priorities but it just sort of sticks out like a red thumb that's all yeah okay thanks so today we haven't exceeded the maximum allowable value yes we have yes um I can't recall whether we've discussed it specifically with the medical office of health it was certainly discussed with a drinking water assessor at the time so we have exceeded the maximum acceptable value in both littleton and in acura but it's highly variable so we've taken samples at the same location multiple times and some occasionally it'll be above the maximum acceptable value and then other times it'll be orders of magnitude lower than that right now in the on the website the medical officer of health has advised that the public health risk must have checked with them at the time and we will keep a close relationship with him on there yeah but the advice say we've got a new drinking water assessor now and um and their advice is that they're now considering whether this should be made a priority to determined for the christchurch water supply which would mean that we have to do more testing which is what we're doing anyway and and also take remedial action so they take they say that any acceptance of the maximum acceptable value is unacceptable it's so have we got a timeline of when um I guess it's a bit difficult and we don't know which areas need to be replaced yet but can we get a timeline for this work yes absolutely and we've already worked out the plan for the ones where we where we have exceeded the maximum acceptable value so we can come back to you with those ones so the other question I have is of course we're all waiting for our water safety plans to be signed off it's not related to chlorine it would stop the water safety plan being signed off no they can approve a water safety plan if there are still unacceptable risks providing the drinking water assisted satisfied that the measures you're taking to address those uh sufficient yeah um great that's good thank you yeah melanie there's a few questions on the unacceptable risks um basically the ones that are in progress so um like the external reservoir and suction tank inspections carried out over summer are they um oh hang on um we we're just doing it melanie we're just dealing with the lead at the moment you've got a question on the report all right so I'll just see if there's any other questions on lead and then I'll come back to you straight away is it on leave yani yeah okay uh I just wanted to check um what the process is for prioritizing the expenditure on the replacement so it'll be based on you know like if we have any any pipes that have an exceedance of and then if we get an exceedance of half that maximum acceptable value then that'd be next and then after that it's just getting through and replacing all of them so we've we've brought forward the replacement of all lead jointed pipes in the long term plan so is there kind of a program that we can look at and see where things are sitting what the budget is um I spoke to sorry what's the name of the craig I spoke to craig this morning him he's going to put that in the memo for his on this week okay I think that'd be really useful for us just you know um that would be good um the other thing is I know on our website we say we're not sure whether chlorine has accelerated the um impact of the lead joints failing are we doing any testing in that regard like what are we doing to understand the impact of the chlorine on the lead yeah so because we've never measured it before chlorine it's hard to tell we did do quite a lot of analysis comparing the lead concentration that we measure with lots of other things so does it change with ph or time of day or retention time or chlorine concentration and we couldn't find any relationship at all um and it said and I just I was talking to my colleague in dunedin yesterday and it sounds like they're having the same thing that there doesn't seem to be any relationship between the lead and any other parameter so it doesn't I don't think it's exacerbated by the chlorine necessarily going to be replaced anyway so any other questions on lead right throw to melanie on the oh no hang on um did you want to introduce the rest of the report and then we'll go to questions sorry thank you thanks very much oh and with this sorry I just want will this be a standing item on the um border report then come to this committee if you can give us an update on what we've worked with yeah thank you thank you very like to do is I'd like to go through the report and pull out the key highlights um through each section um anticipate it will take about 10 minutes um I'll go through it some things where there's a lot of detail I'll just cover over but I'll pause if you want to ask any questions at that point feel free to do so um starting over on the first page then planning and policy so central government reform as well where it's continuing on um the timeline for the programme is ambitious and what's been passed around at the moment is page six of this report which is the latest version which has obviously come out since this report was done so the timeline for this program is ambitious government is looking to engage in options in february and march of this year with policy decisions in april and may public information and education campaign will be driven by central government throughout this year legislation to create new entities is likely to be introduced in late 2021 and then acted in mid-22 moving down the page the department of internal first stimulus funding so council has received the first fifty percent of the grant of twenty million two hundred and sixty thousand with the remainder of those funds being paid through as progress payments um like I say I'm aware that you're getting other updates hence this is just a summary the canterbury service delivery review and that has been to started in december 2020 and will be completed in may 2021 with a final report being delivered on that the big thing for our staff at the moment is the department of internal affairs request for information this request for information was released to council on october 2020 with the deadline for completion on the first of february 2021 and it has been delivered and the list of information is there but suffice to say that is a substantial amount of information which has had to be provided to make sure we provide an accurate information through to central government for their decision process the department of internal affairs have helped out with that and they have provided sixty that request for information um with which council used that to hire two engineering graduates on a short term basis for that data collection and quality assurance over the page is the printout of which has been provided so sorry in that quality assurance was it supposed to be completed by 15th of january has that been completed um I believe so yes that's sorry yes over the page to page seven the water services bill again you've had other briefings on this the tomato white water services regulator bill is a second piece of legislation as part of government's three waters reform bill the first reading of that bill was on was on the 8th of december with public submissions with a closing date of tuesday the 2nd of march 2021 moving internally three waters bylaw review so the review of the 2014 bylaw has been brought forward from the planned 2024 primarily due to the obligations that the recently granted comprehensive stormwater network discharge consent so it's been brought forward to be in line with that um over the page so the timeline time draft bylaws will be presented to three waters infrastructure committee for consideration in april 2021 so staff will be working on that in the background between now and then um over the page onto compliance and quality assurance apologies I did ask my staff member to be here to help with this but unfortunately she's on training um starting off with a comprehensive stormwater network discharge consent the required sediment discharge management plan has been developed and has been submitted to canterbury on the 17th of december so that's now with them third paragraph down planning is underway for the launch and signing of the community's waterway partnership charter on the 22nd of march 2021 at taranga the partnership will look to establish a community water engagement programme involving council canterbury regional council naitahu department of conservation ministry for the environment canterbury district health board universities school industrial representatives water care and community groups with the objective to encourage awareness and community actions to reduce stormwater contamination discharges and to improve waterways through source control and behavior change so I'm quite happy with that as it and get engagement I don't think council can fix stormwater ourselves entirely moving on to the next section in terms of customer service requests and the level of service open service requests staff have been working hard to try and close out a number of the historical service requests particularly the ones that are sitting in the over one year category and three water staff have worked with the continuous improvement team to try and sort out the issues in those systems the focus going forward will continue to be on those open tickets with a concerned effort over the next coming months to try and get that down um and that's both across the three waters assets and also the wheelie bin tickets and there's a table of data in there over the page onto page 10 request resolution um obviously it's quite topical over the summer with the um water restrictions being in place leaks from the water supply network are once again the lowest performing measure a targeted effort to resolve leaks has resulted in an improvement in closing out the jobs over to the previous baseline amount at work health and safety and well-being 91 483 hours were worked in november um december results will come later during those 92 000 hours 34 events were reported which involved 28 near misses and six first aid injuries um information on that is available on the back page over the page for resource consents that's page 11. littleton wastewater littleton wastewater treatment plant um has been brought back into compliance um just in time for the deadline imposed by econ on sorry environmental canterbury on the 16th of december 2020 and the threat of enforcement action on that has been lifted however we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball on that until the wastewater treatment plant is decommissioned and the water pump state so wastewater pump station on site has been commissioned again information on that's further in the report there was three significant non-compliances the most significant one occurred on the 28th of october when there was a reported discharge of black water into a creek off the takapuneke reserve um this was a consequence of the leachate split spilling into the creek the pipeline was appeared on the 28th of october and the majority of the line 250 meters was replaced by the 11th of december with the final clear up on the 14th of december all that information has been provided to environmental canterbury water safety plans um looking at that table there the wainui water safety plan has been submitted on the 12th of november the akarowa water safety plan was submitted on the 18th of september and has been returned approved and staff are working to ensure that all the we comply with that do we know how long before we hear about the christchurch littleton one so around three months possibly sorry the christchurch little one um submit on 23rd december we've had no feedback on it however what I am aware of is the drinking water assessor has given us some feedback on why nui and said that they are presently very busy with obviously what's happening down at dunedin so they have expressed towards a delay in that so yeah they indicated they're running about two weeks behind of pages from that so bottom of page 12 unacceptable risks from the christchurch littleton water safety plan so there's four risks which are still being deemed as unacceptable with ongoing chlorine treatment being used to mitigate two of those risks just to make it clear that none of those unacceptable risks are associated with the ground source so there's nothing wrong with the waters coming out the ground rather these risks are associated with water storage tanks and water distribution systems so I'll touch on the four points below so that's with major microbial contamination storage tanks reservoir suction tanks serving more than 5 000 people due to cracks in the roof or below groundwater up below the below ground surface number two the introduction of contamination material and the distribution system due to leaking of lead in lead joint pipes number three introduction and contamination due to no inadequate faulty or incorrect backflow prevention devices and number four civil emergencies so the next few pages provide some more details on that and I'll move on to page 17 for the financial overview have a favorable variance of 4.75 million to date with the forecast for the end of the year for the units to be in 300 000 favorable moving into solid waste recyclable material collection and processing costs are 1.6 million dollars lower due to low recycled material processing fees as a result of contamination diverting that material to landfill however residual waste collection disposal costs are equally 1.6 million dollars higher due to disposing recycled material directly to landfill operation of closed landfills is one million higher due to planned on receipts of material going into the burwood resource recovery stormwater drainage costs are 1.2 million dollars favorable for the year due to lower maintenance cost flood protection and control are also 1.3 million million dollars lower due to lower planned maintenance costs and costs associated with the heathcote dredging project and the table below provides a breakdown of those figures moving over the page to page 19 water supply e coli water quality monitoring the number of e coli samples taken still continues to exceed the requirements of the drinking water samples so we're still exceeding more than provide that information it's a good thing we're taking more samples than we're required to I agree yes on page 21 um e coli transgression so one e coli transgression occurred on the 25th of november and one e coli transgression occurred on the 24th of december both of these transgressions occurred denton pump station which is a plot which is in the west zone investigations carried out at the pump station showed the source of the contamination was the suction tank due to defects in the roof densum pump station was disconnected from the network on the 26th of december for further investigation options and remedial work so that work is still obviously ongoing at the moment staff have been busy putting in a bypass system which connects the world directly to the surface pumps which has an enable which will enable denton to come back to 50 of service um hopefully next week as soon as that's done the suction tank will be passed across to capital delivery for them to fix work will also then go on to sock burn suction tank as put it aside to keep the zone pressure up um capital delivery pump station was articulation you've got a breakdown there of the projects a bit of information and the budget wasn't planning any interest of time to go into any of those in detail yep all the information is there moving on to page 26 water supply operations so the majority of pump stations and worlds continue to operate as expected pumping an average of 1 803 liters a second so 1.8 tons of water out the ground into the articulation over the page onto 27 you've got the graph the solid red line is this year with the red dotted line being last years before last year's and as you can see we are tracking well above that for august september and october the slightly wetter weather in november and december has helped in dropping that temp chlorination equipment continues to perform well the uv installation at main pumps is working and we are in the process of putting in a dual instrument train so we've got more resilience at that water supply the same reporting period citycare completed 7740 connection repairs 368 backflow prevention device installations and 1559 new water connections so very busy as ever over the page onto 28 um council staff have been working very closely with city care and moving that's included relaxation at time frames around non-urgent jobs which has allowed city tech city care to more effectively allocate resources and improve workflow and to to allow better completion of urgent jobs and this has had positive results over the page to page 29 banks peninsula as I mentioned before particularly dry weather early at the start of spring has dropped a large number of levels within the water supply that's out there so much so that level two water restrictions were imposed in banks balance in december again working very closely with city care to ensure that we're operating those plants well wastewater um christchurch wastewater treatment plant is operated with no ish no significant issues the oxidation pond midges the graph there shows um an overall reduction in the number of midges as we started sampling in 2018 the spike on the the other mitigation approaches of increased vegetation planting seems to have mitigated that so we haven't had we have noticed an increase in the number of midges but it's not been reflected in the number of complaints yet over the page to page 30 wastewater planning there's an update there on the acura reclaim scheme um next section is on wet weather overflow consent so the long ter long time series modeling is underway to determine whether we continue to comply with our wastewater overflow consent 15 years of rainfall data has been run through that model um and it's been recalibrated and so that will be complete in late january um environmental canterbury has agreed to the delayed timeline it has agreed to a delayed deadline for delivering their consent compliance reports in regard to that further down again capital delivery projects information on where it's up to and budget moving across to page 33 storm water and waterwise operation um third paragraph down again with it being very dry there's been very few service requests from customers over the holiday period however paragraph on that page the sum of the beach outfalls are an ongoing potential increase in problem as the beach profile continues to change and rise the hard work street outfall in particular appears to risen in the order of 300 millimeters in the last month we have been able to maintain the functions out for to date but if the beef profile continue to rise it is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive to do so over the post page 34 storm water and waterways planning um the draft of power apologies my pronunciation paul waho um heathcote river and the heratu who were teeny holes while river stormwater management plans represented three waters infrastructure committee on the 16th of december more information is there and further down the capital delivery for the stormwater and waterways again details and budget numbers and yep and that's all that I wanted to touch on with the last table being the health and safety well-being statistics which were referred to earlier in the report I hope that format has worked for you again apologies for pronunciation no I don't don all trying to do I'm going to do the closing at the end of this and I always get a bit nervous about it but um look I think that was absolutely brilliant thank you very much and I think you went through it really succinctly and clearly and it was really really good thank you so I appreciate that so we've got questions now melanie you had one um you know there's some um questions from those tables and the unacceptable risks on um page um it's page 13 um so it's page 39 on ours I think in 13 in the so um under unacceptable risk one in the table um I was just wondering like it says that the external reservoir and suction tank inspections are carried out over summer and it's in progress is that how far along is that um sorry I don't have an update but I'm aware that they are ongoing with city care okay um and then um with the other one was about um a couple of pages on unacceptable risk three the's up to as well no but I'll make sure that's included and then updated for future reports yeah in the media sending leaders out good okay thanks thanks yani um thank you it's got a comprehensive report so sorry skip around with the questions but the the first question I had was around the age testing it said four out of the five units have been complete do we know when the fifth unit will be complete uh I don't think sorry so I just think it'd be good to get an update on that age testing think it's the end of this year 2021 but yeah let's get that for definitely I'm pretty sure that's right um just in regards to um dentin was that defect in the um in that plot in that facility was that was that something should have been picked up during routine maintenance or was it an unusual event that happened that created that problem um we have identified that we have got um issues with um yeah unacceptable risk one into the storage internally the reservoirs yeah um it has what's done and there was some work done on the site I think about eight months before the site did have extensive um work done on it after the earthquakes under skirt right so do we know what caused the defect and the reports are coming at the moment so um I can I'm sure that can be provided yeah with capital delivery at the moment I think would this be helpful to understand um I just wanted to check in terms of um the chlorine the temporary chlorine yep so at this stage do we have any sense of when we can remove it that's dependent on the approval of the water safety plan so and we're kind of expecting that the time frame for that to be soon next month or two so it was lodged in december and previously they've taken about three months but adam just said it's delayed because of issues with dunedin right and then they may come back with other non-compliance stuff so we really don't know so the be complete I'll both get an update on that for you yeah okay that would be good I mean I think um I mean it's good that we've got the tables but the thing that's missing is kind of deadline timeline yep and it's really hard to follow and kind of understand um when things will be done for the things that are in progress obviously the things that have been done we can see just fine I just want to ask um on on the projects going through wolfston both the wilson village project and also alport place just seems to be constantly in a state of nothing happening and are you able just to give us or get us some sense of I apologize however john miles put his hand up it's just like I just was kind of interested in what communication was going on and obviously hoping that boston village is on track but also um I guess more for that all put place which is tied up with the littleton one um I'm trusting that our project managers there I'm expecting them to be away from allport place in the next two months after the construction of the bespoke valve pit and then they will need to come back a month later to install the specialist valve that is coming from overseas and that will probably take a couple of weeks to install and after that we will commence commissioning of that whole scheme yeah and I guess just because that little um cul-de-sac has been basically having like work done consistently for almost the last 10 years um it looks terrible you know there's just it's just like a dumping ground and I get it we need to do the work but I just hope that we've got a good plan when everything's complete to make it look nice again um so just I guess pass on that feedback to you um and and just to ensure that there is good communication going on yeah thanks thanks yani um your answer to the age of the waters on around about page 40 it's late 2021 that work will be completed phil it is a question yes okay with I i see him here ben you've got four tenders and you've it and and it was due to be um um someone's going to be selected has that has that been done and when will it start it's just gone through the system but imagine it it's looking at that it's due to be announced or whoever's the tender execution isn't expected to happen until about mid-march there was a delay with some of the design work and closing out some of the tender tags okay so that's cool and the other one is I hear you talk about city care do they do they do a sort of a rates tender to us for the for the year or do they just get it on bring them up and do it charge up sorry is this for reactive work within the articulation yeah are there's an existing contract in place for that they sorry so there is a contract that's in place for that okay that's cool that's talk to this where that contract's up to yes so we'll be coming to finance and performance in march with um recommendation of what we do with that contract going forward great and I've just got one question oh jimmy one question uh regarding to the uh water supply uh plan by nui and the kaiju littleton we submitted to the drinking water says for review I'm not sure you know when they will feedback to us drinking water assessor has fed back to us yesterday on the update on the submission of the winery water safety plan yes uh indicating they're going to be two weeks behind so in about two weeks we all could get their preliminary assessment back okay but but how about quite church you good now yeah okay I just want to know if these two approved by the uh drinking water sales whether it means all quality needle ten no more the coordinating water or not we do have further work to do under the water safety plan to um before we can just take the chlorination out just't mean we can switch the chlorination off straight away there is unacceptable risks still within the water safety plan which requires further remedial work on that the backflow prevention the age testing the reserves the reasons okay thank you so we've asked for a timeline for the big flow prevention group you know the aging will be completed by the late 2021 and the reservoir so we've got a timeline for those as well sorry john do you have a time frame on the suction tanks and reservoirs no no we'll get that to you do you think it would be after the age testing late 2021 or before yes it's it's likely to be um due to the unique way that christchurch articulation is I cannot just keep um switching all the suction tanks off give them a cross-capital delivery for example in west zone I've got two major suction tanks on two major stations I'm only able to take one off at a time so that's what yeah so yeah and then um I've got a question on weather overflow consenting work so if we do not comply with our consent after we've done this modelling um a wastewater optimization project will be undertaken to determine the most cost-effective suite of upgrades to reduce overflows and comply so will we have budget for that I mean is this this would be non-anticipated work or did you have an inkling that we might or I mean so we did we did some modeling and we determined that we considered that there was a compliance issue in some areas but what we did find was that the work that we had completed reduced the volumes of the overflows significantly so we will now be able to focus on those specific areas to do upgrades and I think we'll be able to find the the money to do those projects we once we get the model back we will be in discussion with ecan regarding the compliance because I think in our view although the number of the number of sites is reduced the volume is also reduced significantly right so you're confident we'll be able to is it for john oh it might as well your stays thanks great stay I just want to get down into denton park tank a little bit more I've I've through the office of the ce I've understood that it was damaged in the earthquake and got a lot of repair done on it 350 odd grains worth whatever with this could not have happened at the worst time of the year that you had to shut it down when it was the number of hot days that we had and that's mainly because then we had to have the water restrictions on so to speak to just cover ourselves a bit how much is it costing to bypass the tank at the moment roughly and because I'm wrong the costs are still ongoing at the moment so we've we've done the mechanical work yeah the electrical work is still ongoing at the moment it should be hopefully finished next few days and then we've got the associated laboratory samples with that so we are keeping a track of the costs so tank was damaged a bit from what I understand from the office of the ce the the tank is structurally sound but the roof has got because it's made up like um segments of that cheese block yeah and it's leaking between the cracks it's only 110 grand to put a butanol roof over the top of it so why are we doing all this extra work to bypass the tank when or should we have given you more money last year to fix the roof so this problem wouldn't have happened we're looking to put a a membrane roof on dentin but the idea of being able to take the suction tank out of services so we can address all the other defects that are in that tank as well which include the walls and some on the roof some on the floor I understand okay thank you yeah great any other questions jani just on my agenda there's reference to the um what is it uh why the the one in new brighton next to knight's train that's pond is to carry what what what are you stopping yeah the wait take your stop bangs thank you and just wanted to check it's it's now talking about being integrated with the um I generate the regeneration plan but like I'm just wondering how the pages where bridge and the other stuff on the other side all relates to each other because it's a huge amount of money going in um I think when it came to council it was raised hopefully that's been done with the pages red bridge so we get an integrated design but I don't see reference to that in here which is why I was raising it do you know um I think andrew rutledge is doing the coordination for the residential red zone projects yes three three waters are proceeding with their projects and advising um that coordination process what our processes are and so we're making sure that communication is occurring yeah andrew made that quite clear in a presentation recently but they're all working together so I guess what I'm concerned about is the design's going to be completed by january 2021 and yet we've had no understanding about pages or a bridge um we've got conversations going on about the cycle way we haven't even chosen the route selection um so you know I just I just think we should really try and align these projects as much as possible given the huge amount of money that's been spent in this little corner of the city which must be close to you know 50 or 60 million I agree um and we're communicating with the um control group that looks at that so that they're aware of what our program is so I'm hoping they're taking account of that I trust that they will be taking account of that okay because it might be helpful if we approve the cycleway route um then they know whether it's going through there or not and also I thought we had to discuss realignment off the page's road bridge to shift it slightly so yeah well can we just get a memo on that just ways yeah the bridge team all working together and there's the other project on the other side which I'm still the waitaki I don't quite understand why we need to spend all that money so just a quick memo assuring us that this is all lined up yeah yeah the west the western one the western side yeah okay any other questions on this report if not I'll move it I have a seconder for this report james any debate any discussion I just wanted to congratulate you again for the way you presented it adam's excellent and thanks john for being here to answer those questions and thanks for bringing bridget in for the lead questions that was really helpful all right I'll put the resolution to receive the information all those in favor say aye opposed that's carried brings us to the end of our meeting so I'll do the closing tukuna thank you you
Access now to number eight motormate which is the um three waters infrastructure environment committee report on the three waters and adam twice welcome to the table I thought this is a very very good report obviously we must thank helen for it as well in her absence yeah certainly yeah if you'd like to give us a quick introduction and anything that may have been updated since this has gone live would be helpful just chuck it in um yep certainly um I've invited bridget o'brien as well um she's up to speed with the um lead situation just to provide the situation where we are up to within christchurch so would you like to jump into that straight away just so you can provide an update on that before I dive into the twee report sure okay let's do that okay being a hot topic at the moment it's probably quite good to to get a picture of our position with the lead in the pipes so a memo was provided on the led situation in christchurch in accora and littleton back new version of that memo an updated version by the end of this week however given the topic I just wondered if you have any questions here and we can provide a quick informal update on that memo now yep so that's actually well sorry apologies are just working on this this morning um so in terms of the previous memo um the memo indicated we're going to start undertaking some additional lead sampling in december january and february of december 2020 and obviously the start of this year unfortunately that sampling has not started due to issues and staff resources so we have recently experienced issues with almost next to reservoir and also transgression events at dunton which I'll touch on in the twee report this also coincides with a lack of available resources in the laboratory however speaking to the team this morning we have allocated a dedicated staff member who is working on that this week with sampling to go um to start on monday the 15th of february um the type of sampling we're going to be doing is 24-hour composite typical web samples that have been done to date and just to provide a little bit of background on that the drinking water standards does not require us to sample for lead and the articulation it only requires us to sample in the raw water every five years and all the way through this process we have been communicating frequently with the drinking water assessor as well any questions soon just one quick one so in terms of the I guess the lack of resource or the ability not to do it yet um has that been brought forward because of the dunedin situation and I guess if it has what would be the mechanism where we'd have some oversight over that work not being completed there might be a question for carol potentially but uh unfortunately it's just the time of the year um in terms of laboratory they're working hard the amount of extra drinking water samples we've been doing for the new water safety plans that have been submitted so lot of extra work has gone into that um but particularly with the suction tank is what's taking our attention away a bit yeah but we had planned on doing the sampling from 2019 and we just haven't had the staff to do it it's just been we're just too busy doing other stuff it just gets head kept falling to the bottom of the list but obviously with dunedin it's brought it back up um into sharp focus again yeah so what what's the way in which that's feedback to us I guess is it through this report on a regular basis saying we haven't yet completed it it would be yeah yeah and as adam said we're going to be sending you an updated uh fully um fully informed memo to you um by the end of the week yeah okay so in the there's a lot of information on the website I just send that link around and you're going to update it on the website but it says here there's less than three percent of our uh net workers has lead in it um and if you're very intensely located obviously in the older part of christchurch in the in the city which is probably could be a good thing in a way if you're going to replace them all yeah so it's three percent overall but it's 19 in littleton so littleton's the um the worst case yeah so most of it in littleton yeah so it's basically you know you think about where the parts of town have got the really old houses in yeah that's right yeah so there's bits of it in the city as well in the in the older suburbs but primarily uh littleton's the and so would that be the priority areas for testing then for this one staff member that's going to launch off on monday uh yes I should think so yeah well how long will that take that whole testing I think it was a three month program was identified in the memo thanks sarah thank you I mean you mentioned that the work hasn't happened because of resourcing and I know we've had like pieces um if there was more resourcing put in place by council laws would that work be able to happen more quickly yeah it'd be helpful yeah okay thank you james so sorry just done that we have got two extra resources in the laboratory but just to try and maintain the number of samples that we've got at this moment in time but this is still regarded as buffers extra above to that picture please we just hear that yeah can you blow that up look is it my time yes yes I've got a question I'm not sure if it's appropriate for now but that's interesting about the lead pipes and where they are and I just noticed that the coastal lambour primarily burwood wards don't have many possibly because they were all cleaned up after the earthquakes I assume but there is one that goes when I saw it and we're trying to find it on the map now there's one that goes across I think it's new brighton road or bower the bauer bridge or the only one over that side of town wouldn't it be good to get that fixed so that there's no risk of lead infused water going through there so to answer your question about why there aren't any over in the east it's because these pipes are pre-1930s_:_409.16 so they're cast iron pipes and they were joined with lead joints um so I imagine that that area developed after the 1930s which is why you haven't got those older ones and I think I mean we just have to prioritize so what we're doing is measuring the concentrations and then prioritizing the pipes but the ones of most concern are the ones where we've got dead ends so where the water is going to um stagnate in the pipe and the lead will sort of leach out whereas I would expect the one going over the bower if that's the bauer road bridge um you know it would be reasonably well flushed um but we just need to make sure that we're getting around and sampling them all yeah yeah I appreciate that um there are priorities but it just sort of sticks out like a red thumb that's all yeah okay thanks so today we haven't exceeded the maximum allowable value yes we have yes um I can't recall whether we've discussed it specifically with a medical officer that was certainly discussed with a drinking water assessor at the time so have exceeded the maximum acceptable value in both littleton and in acura but it's highly variable so we've taken samples at the same location multiple times and some occasionally it'll be above the maximum acceptable value and then other times it'll be orders of magnitude lower than that right now in the on the website the medical officer of health has advised that the public health risk is extremely low and close to nil oh okay we must have checked with them at the time yeah and we will keep a close relationship with them on there yeah and so but the advice so we've got a new drinking water assessor now and um and their advice is that they to determinant for the christchurch water supply which would mean that we have to do more testing which is what we're doing anyway and and also take remedy action so they take they they're saying that any acceptance of the maximum acceptable value is unacceptable it's like have we got a timeline of when um I guess it's bit difficult and we don't know which areas need to be replaced yet but can we get a timeline for this work yes absolutely and we've we've already worked out the plan for the ones where we where we have exceeded the maximum acceptable value so we can come back to you with those ones so the other question I have is of course we're all waiting for our water safety plans to be signed off lead as part of the water safety plan even though it's not related to chlorine it would stop the water safety plan being signed off no they can approve a water safety plan if there are still unacceptable risks providing the drinking water assessed and satisfied that yeah great that's good thank you melanie there's a few questions on the unacceptable risks basically the ones that are in progress so um like the external reservoir and suction tank inspections carried out over summer are they um oh hang on um we we're just doing it melanie we're just dealing with the lead at the moment you've got a question I can report all right so I'll just see if there's any other questions on lid and then I'll come back to you straight away is it on leave yani yeah okay uh I just wanted to check um what the process is for prioritising the expenditure on the replacement so it'll be based on you know like if we have any any pipes that have an exceedance of maximum acceptable value obviously a top of the list and then if we get an exceedance of half that maximum acceptable value then that'd be next and then after that it's just getting through and replacing all of them so we've we've brought forward the replacement so is there kind of a program that we can look at and see where things are sitting what the budget is um I spoke to sorry what's the name of that craig I spoke to craig this morning him he's going to put that in the memo for us on this week okay I think that'd be really useful for us just you know um that would be good um the other thing is I know on our website we say we're not sure whether chlorine has accelerated the um impact of the lead joints failing are we doing any testing in that regard like what are we doing to understand the impact of the chlorine on the lead yeah so because we've never measured it before chlorine it's hard to tell whether chlorine is having an effect or not um and we did do quite a lot of analysis comparing the lead concentration that we measure with lots of other things so does it change with ph or time of day or retention time or chlorine concentration and we couldn't find just I was talking to my colleague in dunedin yesterday and it sounds like they're having the same thing that there doesn't seem to be any relationship between the lead and any other parameter so it doesn't I don't think it's exacerbated by the chlorine necessarily going to be replaced anyway so any other questions on lead right throw to melanie on the oh no hang on um did you want to introduce the rest of the report and then we'll go to questions sorry thank you thanks very much oh and with this sorry I just want will this be a standing item on the um border report then coming to this committee if you can give us an update on what we've worked with yeah thank you update right far away then okay um what I'd like to do is I'd like to go through the report and pull out the key highlights um through each section anticipate it will take about 10 minutes um I'll go through it some things where there's a lot of detail you want to ask any questions at that point feel free to do so um starting over on the first page then planning and policy so central government reform as well where it's continuing on and the timeline for the programme is ambitious and what's being passed around at the moment is page six of this report which is the latest version which has obviously come out since this report was done so the timeline for this program is ambitious government is looking to engage in options in february and march of this year with policy decisions in april and may public information and education campaign will be driven by central government throughout this year legislation to create new entities is likely to be introduced in late 2021 and then acted in mid-22 with the entities establishment and transition across that in 2022-2023 moving down the page the department of internal first stimulus funding so council has received the first fifty percent of the grant of twenty million two hundred and sixty thousand with the remainder of those funds being paid through as progress payments um like I hence this is just a summary the canterbury service delivery review and that has been to started in december 2020 and will be completed in may 2021 with a final report being delivered on that um the big thing for our staff at the moment is the department of internal affairs request for information this request for information was released to council on october 2020 with the deadline for completion on the 1st of february 2021 and it has been delivered and the list of information is there but suffice to say that is a substantial amount of information which has had to be provided to make sure we provide an accurate information through to central government for their decision process the department of internal affairs have helped out with that and they have provided sixty thousand dollars of stimulus funding to support the delivery of that request for information um with which council used that to hire two engineering graduates on a short term basis for that data collection and quality assurance over the page is the printout of which has been provided so sorry in that quality assurance completed um I believe so yes sorry yes over the page to page seven uh the water services bill again you've had other briefings on this um the tomato white water services regulator bill is a second piece of legislation as part of government's three waters reform bill the first reading of that bill without was on the 8th of december with public submissions with a closing date of tuesday the 2nd of march 2021 moving internally three waters bylaw review so the review of the 2014 bylaw has been brought forward from the planned 2024 primarily due to the obligations that the recently granted comprehensive stormwater network discharge consent so it's been brought forward to be in line with that over the page so the timeline time frame of that review the review report and the proposed draft bylaws will be presented to three waters infrastructure committee for consideration in april 2021 so staff will be working on that in the background between now and then um over the page onto compliance and quality assurance apologies I did ask my staff member to be here to starting off with a comprehensive stormwater network discharge consent the required sediment discharge management plan has been developed and has been submitted to canterbury on the 17th of december so that's now with them third paragraph down planning is underway for the launch and signing of the community's waterway partnership charter on the 22nd of march 2021 at taranga the partnership will look to establish a community water engagement programme involving council canterbury regional council naitahu department of conservation ministry for the environment canterbury district health board universities school industrial representatives water care and community groups with the objective to encourage awareness and community actions to reduce stormwater contamination discharges and to improve waterways through source control and behavior change so I'm quite happy with that as it shows that we're trying to recharge community and get engagement I don't think council can fix stormwater ourselves entirely moving on to the next section in terms of customer service requests and the level of service open service requests staff have been working hard to try and close out a number of the historical service requests particularly category and three water staff have worked with the continuous improvement team to try and sort out the issues in those systems the focus going forward will continue to be on those open tickets with a concerned effort over the next coming months to try and get that down um and that's both across the three waters assets and also the wheelie bin tickets and there's a table of data in there over the page onto page 10 request resolution um obviously it's quite topical over the summer with the um water restrictions being in place leaks from the water supply network are once again the lowest performing measure a targeted effort to resolve leaks has resulted in an improvement in closing out the jobs over the last month with 685 more tickets being closed compared to the previous baseline amount at work health and safety and well-being 91 483 hours were worked in november um december results will come later during those 92 000 hours 34 events were reported which involved 28 near misses and six first aid injuries information on that is available on the page 11. littleton wastewater time littleton wastewater treatment plant um has been brought back into compliance um just in time for the deadline imposed by econ on sorry environmental canterbury on the 16th of december 2020 and the threat of enforcement action on that has been lifted however we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball on that until the wastewater treatment plant is decommissioned and the water pump stay so wastewater pump station on site has been commissioned again information on that further in the report there was three significant non-compliances the most significant one occurred on the 28th of october when there was a reported discharge of black water into a creek off the takapuneke reserve um this was a consequence of the leachate capture pipeline from the anuku landfill so the pipeline had split spilling into the creek the pipeline was repaired on the 28th of october and the majority of the line 250 meters was replaced by the 11th of december with the final clear up on the 14th of december all that information has been provided to environmental canterbury water safety plans um has been submitted on the 12th of november the akarowa water safety plan was submitted on the 18th of september and has been returned approved and staff are working to ensure that all the we comply with that do we know how long before we hear about the christchurch littleton one so around three months possible sorry the christchurch little one um submitted on 23rd december we've had no feedback on it however what I am aware of is the drinking water assessor has given us some feedback on why nui and said that they are presently very busy with obviously what's happening down at dunedin so they have expressed towards a delay in that so yeah they indicated they're running about two weeks behind um so I've just touched on the next couple of pages from that so bottom of page 12 unacceptable risks from the christchurch littleton water safety plan so there's four risks which are still being deemed as unacceptable with ongoing chlorine treatment being used to mitigate two of those risks just to make it clear that none of those unacceptable nothing wrong with the waters coming out the ground rather these risks are associated with water storage tanks and water distribution systems so I'll touch on the four points below so that's with major microbial contamination storage tanks reservoir suction tanks serving more than 5 000 people due to cracks in the roof or below groundwater up below the below ground surface number two the introduction of contamination material and the distribution system due to leaching of lead in lead joint pipes number three introduction contamination due to no inadequate faulty or incorrect backflow prevention devices and number four civil emergencies so the next few pages provide some more details on that and I'll move on to page 17 for the financial overview the operational results for november 2020 for three waters we have a favorable variance of 4.75 million to date with the forecast for the end of the year for the units to be in 300 000 favorable moving into solid waste uh recyclable material collection and processing costs are 1.6 million dollars lower due to low recycled material processing fees as a result collection disposal costs are equally 1.6 million dollars higher due to disposing recycled material directly to landfill operation of closed landfills is 1 million higher due to planned unreceipts of material going into the birdwood resource recovery stormwater drainage costs are 1.2 million dollars favorable for the year due to lower maintenance cost flood protection and control are also 1.3 million million dollars lower due to lower planned maintenance costs and costs associated with the heathcote dredging project and the table below provides a breakdown of those figures moving over the page to page 19 water supply e coli water quality monitoring the number of e coli samples taken still continues to exceed the requirements of the drinking water samples so we're still exceeding more than we're supposed to and there's charts there that provide that information it's a good thing we're taking more samples than we're required to I agree yes on page 21 um e coli transgression so one e coli transgression occurred on the 25th of november and one e coli transgression occurred on the 24th of december both of these is in the west zone investigations carried out at the pump station showed the source of the contamination was the suction tank due to defects in the roof dense and pump station was disconnected from the network on the 26th of december for further investigation options and remedial work so that work is still obviously ongoing at the moment um staff have been busy putting in a bypass system which connects the welds directly to the surface pumps which has an enable which will enable denton to come back to 50 of service um hopefully next week as soon as that's done the suction tank will be passed across to capital delivery for them to fix work will also then go on to sock burn suction tank as well and bypass there to try and prop that up put aside to keep the zone pressure up um capital delivery pump station was articulation you've got a breakdown there of the projects a bit of information and the budget and wasn't planning and the interest of time to go into any of those in detail all the information so the majority of pump stations and wells continue to operate as expected pumping an average of 1 803 liters a second so 1.8 tons of water out the ground into the articulation over the page onto 27 you've got the graph the solid red line is this year with the red dotted line being last year's before last year's and as you can see we are tracking well above that for august september and october the slightly wetter weather in november and december has helped in dropping that temp chlorination equipment continues to perform well the uv installation at main pumps is working and we are in the process of putting in a dual instrument train so we've got more resilience at that water supply articulation we had 16 269 requests for service logged in the same reporting period citycare completed 7740 connection repairs 368 backflow prevention device installations and 1559 new water connections so very busy as ever over the page onto 28 um council staff have been working very closely with city care and moving that's included relaxation and time frames around effectively allocate resources and improve workflow and to to allow better completion of urgent jobs and this has had positive results over the page to page 29 banks peninsula as I mentioned before particularly dry weather early at the start of spring has dropped a large number of levels within the water supply that's out there so much so that level two water restrictions were imposed in banks burlington december again working very closely with citicare to ensure that we're operating those plants well wastewater um christchurch wastewater treatment plant is operated with no ish no significant issues the oxidation pond midges the graph there shows um an overall reduction in the number of midges since we started sampling in 2018 um the spike on the right is associated with that warmer dry weather again however the other mitigation approaches of increased vegetation planting seems to have mitigated that so we haven't had we have noticed an increase in the number of midges but it's not been reflected in the number of complaints yet over the page to page 30 wastewater planning um there's an is on wet weather overflow consent so the long ter long time series modeling is underway to determine whether we continue to comply with our wastewater overflow consent 15 years of rainfall data has been run through that model um and it's been recalibrated and so that will be completed in late january an environmental canterbury has agreed to the delayed timeline it has agreed to a delayed deadline for delivering their consent compliance reports in regard to that further down again capital delivery projects information on where it's up to and budget moving across to page 33 storm water and waterwise operation um third paragraph down again with it being very dry there's been very few service requests from customers over the holiday period however I'd like to draw your attention to the last paragraph on that page the sum of the beach outfalls are an ongoing and potential increase in problem as the beach profile continues to change and rise the hardwick's streets out for particularly appears to have risen in the order of 300 millimeters in the last month we have been if the beef profile continue to rise it is becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive to do so over the page to page 34 stormwater and waterways planning um the draft of power apologies for my pronunciation uh paul wahoo um heathcote river and the hera2 river stormwater management plans represented three waters infrastructure committee on the 16th of december more information is there and further down the capital delivery for the storm water and waterways again details and budget numbers and yep and that's all that I wanted to touch on with the last table being the health and safety well-being statistics which were referred to earlier in the report I hope that format has worked for you again apologies for pronunciation no I don't don't apologize just keep practicing that's what we're all trying to do I'm going to do the closing at the end of this and I always get a bit nervous about it but um look I think that was absolutely brilliant thank you very much and I think you went through it really succinctly and clearly and it so we've got questions now melanie you had one um yeah no there's some um questions from those tables and the unacceptable risks on um page um it's page 13 um so it's page 39 on ours I think in 13 in the so um under unacceptable risk one in the table um I was just wondering like it says that the external reservoir and suction tank inspections are carried out over summer and it's in progress is that how far along is that um sorry I don't have an update but I'm aware that they are one going with city care okay um and then um with the other one was about um a couple of pages on unacceptable risk three the backflow um how do you know anything about where that's up to as well no I'll make sure that's included and then update for future reports yeah in the media sending leaders out good okay thanks thanks yani um thank you it's quite a comprehensive report so sorry skip around with the questions but the the said four out of the five units have been complete do we know when the fifth unit will be complete uh I don't do sorry so I just think it'd be good to get an update on that age testing think it's the end of this year 2021 but yeah let's get that for definite pretty sure that's right um just in regards to um dentin was that defect in the um in that plot in that facility was that was that something should have been picked up during routine maintenance or was it an unusual event that happened that created that problem um we have identified that we have got um issues with um yeah unacceptable risk one into the storage tanks so we are going round undertaking assessments external and internally the reservoirs yeah um it has what's done and there was some work done on the site I think about eight months before the site did have extensive um work done on it after the earthquakes under skirt right so do you know what caused the defect um the reports are sure that can be provided yeah with capital delivery at the moment I think would this be helpful to to understand um I just wanted to check in terms of um the chlorine the temporary chlorine yep so at this stage do we have any sense of when we can remove it that's dependent on the approval of the water safety plan so and we're kind of expecting that the time frame for that to be soon next month or two so it was lodged in december and previously they've taken about three months but adam just said it's delayed because of issues with dunedin right and then they may come back with other non-compliance stuff so we really don't know so the the back play for prevention um when's that schedule to be complete I'll both get an update on that for you yeah okay that would be good I mean I think um I mean it's good that we've got the tables but the thing that's missing is kind of designed timeline yep and it's really hard be done for the things that are in progress obviously the things that are being done we can see just fine I just want to ask um on on the projects going through wolfston both the wilson village project and also alport place just seems to be constantly in a state of nothing happening and are you able just to give us or give us some sense of so I apologize so I'm I'm covering for helen oh yeah so I'm mainly operational so however john miles put his hand up it's just like I just was kind of interested in what communication was going on and obviously hoping that boston village is on track but also um I guess more for that all put place which is tied up with the littleton one um I'm trusting that our project managers are doing the appropriate um communication with the with the residents there I'm expecting them to be away from allport place in the next two months after the construction of the bespoke valve pit and then they will need to come back a coming from overseas and that will probably take a couple of weeks to install and after that we will commence commissioning of that whole scheme yeah and I guess just because that little um cul-de-sac has been basically having like work done consistently for almost the last 10 years um it looks terrible you know there's just it's just like a dumping ground and I get it we need to do the work but I just hope that we've got a good plan when everything's complete to make it look nice again um so just I guess pass on that feedback to you um and and just to ensure that there is good communication going on yeah thanks thanks yoni um your answer to the age of the waters on around about page 40 it's late 2021 that work will be completed phil what a question do you think is it a question it is a question yes okay what I see in here you've got four tenders and you've if and it was due to be um um someone's going to will it start it's just gone through the system but imagine it it's looking at that it's due to be announced or whoever's the tender execution isn't expected to happen until about mid-march there was a delay with some of the design work and closing out some of the tender tags okay so that's cool and the other one is I hear you talk about city care do they do they do a sort of a rates tender to us for the for the year or do they just get it on bring them up and do it charge up is this for reactive work within the articulation yeah are there's an existing contract in place for that they sorry so there is a contract that's in place for that okay that's cool that's right that's cool I'm sorry caroline to talk to this where that contracts up to yeah so where we're coming to finance and performance in march with um recommendation of what we do with that contract going forward great and I've just the uh water supply the uh plan uh by nui and the koichi littleton we submitted to the drinking water says for review I'm not sure know when they will feedback to us um we um drinking water assessor has fed back to us yesterday on the update on the submission of the wainui what safety plan yes uh indicating they're going to be two weeks behind so in about two weeks we all could get their preliminary assessment back okay but bahar about quite church be good I am okay I just want to know if these two approved by the uh drinking water sales whether it mean the old culture and needleton no more the coordinating water or not we do have further work to do under the water safety plan to before we can just take the chlorination out just because the water safety plans have proven with us doesn't mean we can switch the chlorination off straight away there is unacceptable risks still within the water safety plan which requires further remedial work on that the backflow prevention the age testing the reserves a timeline for the big flow prevention group you know the agent will be completed by the late 2021 and the reservoir so we've got a timeline for those as well sorry john do you have a time frame on the suction tanks and reservoirs no no we'll get that to you do you think it would be after the age testing late 2021 or before yes it's it's likely to be um due to the unique way that christchurch articulation is I cannot just keep switching all the suction tanks off give them a cross-capital delivery for example in west zone I've got two major suction tanks on two major stations I'm only able to take one off at a time so that's what yeah so yeah and then um I've got a question on page 56 I think and it's about the wet weather overflow consenting work so if we do not comply with our consent after we've done this modelling um um a wastewater optimization project will be undertaken to determine the most cost-effective suite of upgrades for that I mean is this this would be non-anticipated work or did you have an inkling that we might or I mean so we did we did some modeling and we determined that we considered that there was a compliance issue in some areas but what we did find was that the work that we had completed reduced the volumes of the overflows significantly so we will now be able to focus on those specific areas to do upgrades and I think we'll be able to find the the money to do those projects we once we get the model back we will be in discussion with ecan regarding the compliance because I think in our view although the number of the number of sites is reduced the volume is also reduced significantly right so you're confident we'll be able to manage it sure great answer thank you phil is it is it for john oh it might as well your stay safe stay um I just want to get down into denton park tank a little bit more I've I've through the office in the earthquake and got a lot of repair done on it 350 odd grains worth or whatever with it this could not have happened at the worst time of the year that you had to shut it down when it was the number of hot days that we had and that's mainly because uh then we had to have the water restrictions on so to speak to just cover ourselves a bit how much is it costing to bypass the tank at the moment roughly and because I'm wrong the costs are still ongoing at the moment so we've we've done the mechanical work yeah the electrical work is still ongoing at the moment it should be hopefully finished next few days and then we've got the associated laboratory samples with that so we are keeping a track of the costs so just but we've had to do this because the tank was damaged a bit from what I understand from the office of the ce the tank is structurally sound but the roof has got because it's made up like segments it's leaking between the cracks it's only 110 grand to put a butanol roof over the top of it so why are we doing all this extra work to bypass the tank when or should we have given you more money last year to fix the roof so this problem wouldn't have happened we're looking to put a membrane roof on dentin but the idea of being able to take the suction tank out of services so we can address all the other defects that are in that tank as well which include the walls and some on the roof and some on the floor I understand okay thank you yeah great any other questions jani just on my agenda there's reference to the um what is it uh why the the one in new brighton next tonight's train that's pond is the one that's in the red zone what what to carry what what what are you stopping yeah the waiter is stopping thinking and just wanted to check it's it's now talking about being integrated with the um wondering how the pages where a bridge and the other stuff on the other side all relates to each other because it's a huge amount of money going in um I think when it came to council it was raised hopefully that's been done with the pages red bridge so we get an integrated design but I don't see reference to that in here which is why I was raising it do you know um I think andrew rutledge is doing the coordination for the residential red zone projects yes three three waters are proceeding with their projects and advising um that coordination process what our processes are and so we're making sure that communication is occurring yeah andrew made that quite clear in a presentation recently but they're all working together so I guess what I'm concerned about is the designs sorry I found the page on page 38 the design's going to be completed by january 2021 and yet we've had no understanding about pages or a bridge um we've got conversations going on about the cycle way we know I just I just think we should really try and align these projects as much as possible given the huge amount of money that's been spent in this little corner of the city which must be close to you know 50 or 60 million I agree um and we're communicating with the um control group that looks at that so that they're aware of what our program is so I'm hoping they're taking account of that I trust that they will be taking account of that okay because it might be helpful if we approve the cycleway route um then they know whether it's going through there or not and also I thought we had to discuss realignment off the page's road bridge to shift it slightly so yeah well can we just get a memo on that just assuring us that that's the the parks the cycleways yeah bridge team all working together and there's the other project on the other side which I'm still the waitaki I don't quite understand why we need to spend all that this is all lined up yeah yeah the west the western any other questions on this report if not I'll move it I have a seconder for this report james any debate any discussion I just wanted to congratulate you again for the way you presented it adams excellent and thanks john for being here to answer those questions and thanks for bringing bridget in for the leave questions that was really helpful all right I'll put the resolution to receive the information all those in favor say aye opposed that's carried brings us to the end of our meeting so I'll do the closing tukuna a everybody thank you you
Daughter thank you the next item on the agenda deputations by appointment uh we had no deputations by appointment scheduled and no presentation of uh petitions move to the um next item which is to confirm the council minutes from the 10th of december 2020 with someone like to move that mike davidson seconded andrew turner I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye
Today no petitions that brings us nicely to item seven which is the water zone committee's uh terms of reference and you might remember that this came back to us and came to us in november we had quite a discussion about this ecan have confirmed the terms of reference on the 10th of december and the this originated from the mural forum in 2019 to have this review because things kind of change along the way with the zone committees that have been in place since I think 2010 so I'd like to welcome emma and diane to the table and would you like to just do a brief introduction on where we're at with this please yes so as you indicated um the um the processes has been um ongoing for the last year or so um and you would have seen discussions again in november about some draft generic terms of reference as well as looking at letters of shared priorities so that was both of those items were agreed to at the november meeting since then ekian has received a report on draft stage of the process is for all of the district councils then to receive the those generic terms of reference and go through the same process of considering them and hopefully adopting them and again these are for generic terms of reference they're not specific to it any particular individual zone committee because they refer to there's blanks in terms of the areas and that type of thing and the names of the specific district councils etc so these are just generic terms of reference um the the big change between the current terms of reference and the ones in front of you have to do with the zone committees being more on the ground in terms of how they operate and what they do so for example the current terms of reference call for the zone committees to meet I believe it's eight times a year as for public meetings that's been dropped down to um um at least four that doesn't mean that they're only do four but they they only have to do four in terms of the terms of to be working with interested parties in the community to do to basically promote water issues within their zones and be a lot more hands-on um and I think I'll just leave it there if there's any questions or comments right we did have a question around um whether christchurch could have a representative on one akiri for example um due to the nitrate issue that's that's looming there um and so do your response to that um well as you probably are aware the terms of the current terms of reference as well as the um the new ones um both say the same things in terms of um the territorial authority's representation on the the various zone committees and so it's based on the location of the zones and the waimakariri zone does not include any part of christ church so on that basis then we wouldn't have a representative in terms of whether or not there's been a formal request to have a representative as best I know um that hasn't that request has not been made to to also go to waimakariri if that was a proposal yeah and possibly a better way is just to work through the christchurch west melton zone committee and their relationship with the waimakuri zone committee and and our representative on christchurch we smelt and being james daniels can keep us in the loop about that particular issue that's probably a better way to do it um yes in terms of the issue around nitrates as you may be aware the um two or three years ago the y microwave zone committee did an addendum to their zone implementation program which is basically a series of recommendations for issues within the zone one of which had to do with nitrates and groundwater and surface water and those recommendations were passed along to ecan which then used those recommendations to help develop that portion of the canterbury land and water regional plan that has to do with the waimakariri zone so that was part of plan change seven which as you know we did make a submission on there were hearings um on plan change seven in um november and december on the submissions that were received but there has been at this point um the hearings are over that the last hearings were I think the first or second week in december um so the the commissioners have not yet released their decisions so um we're not you know we don't know where where that's going to be yet in terms of of nitrates but um in terms of specific recommendations around um rules in and that type of thing it's the zone companies in essence already had their say in that process that's right and it's been a good process I mean one opportunity could be that we share the agenda and the minutes from the waimakariri zone committee yeah meetings and then that would give us visibility of you know what's coming up on the agenda and then I we were thinking you know then there could be an opportunity to sort of invite you know get a briefing if there was a particular area of interest so that might be a step in sort of closer engagement without necessarily asking way to go sarah thank you thank you um just checking the um the new freshwater standards did they have to be taken into account as well with the plane change seven hearings because they came out before the hearings yeah that's yeah because it was quite different to what have been put forth in the zipper correct so the national policy statement for fresh water management came out after the draft plan change seven went out for consultation that being said there was some discussion at the hearings about that so on the one hand my recollection is that um the commissioners are would be aware of what those changes are because they are different nitrates to the national bottom line for nitrates is quite different now under the npsf yeah nps fm 2020 as opposed to the current one um can you tell us what they are that this is memorized to say um are you able to circulate the the the staff recommendations being made public yeah they're on there they just were released on on econs okay are you able to just circulate the our information um there well um I'd have to go through the report and look for for references to the feedback so this is basically this is the staff ecan staff response to what came up during the um the uh hearings yeah to you know so it's on like I said the commissioners have not yet released their determinations okay yeah let's see how it goes keep us updated well that's any other questions there we sort of wandered off in terms of reference for the zone committee but I allowed that because it was actually good to have that update and uh it's an interesting process um are there any other questions on the design committee terms sam just one quick one so with the meeting and remuneration guidelines around the remuneration for each one um the youth appointments would they be considered appointed members as well that's my understanding so they'd get paid the four thousand as well that's my understanding okay thanks jimmy if the sweetwater's reform the bill if eventually approved by the government whether these know that's a completely separate process okay thank you second question is regarding to the yellow line part you you point out still the teaching council no any the city council on there so you you have the yellow yellow line here um oh okay it's not the norway if it's if it's within the the terms the generation reference yeah so so what will happen is um assuming that um each of the district councils approve the generic terms of reference what will happen is then um the specific terms of reference for each zone committee will then be completed yes and where it's yellow where it might say um right now it just says xx runanga for example that will be for each zone committee that will be the specific renong of the specific district or city councils will be filled in so we'll see those individual ones high industry in due course okay okay thank you yes okay thank you so fill in the gap so just and we've just got an additional um it's a bit of a in the on the agenda in page 16. so that just says indicates that um our request to actually be able to have an alternate in the future once we get down to the specific terms of reference so no other questions have a mover for this jimmy like to move it melanie seconded any debate or discussion all right thanks for the work I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye

Uh public forum there's two public forums today we have to talk to the consultation period on the wheels the wings major cycleway first up is yvonne palmer carol thank carol you can see welcome you just need to push the wheel button in front of you yeah perfect uh good morning councillors and staff and mr chairman um thanks for letting us talk I'm here as an independent resident who lives at wesley village and I exit out onto marblewood drive um I have a letterbox with 5c on it so I'm an independent resident and I did receive the brochure because of that but there were other 50 other people who didn't actually receive a brochure that live at wesley who are as independent as I am and actually walk or use their people like you need to be aware of that I have personally spoken to many people who did not see the pamphlet and I'm speaking on their behalf there are 50 independent people living like me in wesley mobility scooters wheelchairs electric wheelchairs daily at the christchurch methodist mission up there were 60 more 160 people in the hospital section no brochure at all they travel they pack their car and marble would drive they are also affected and not been had received a brochure so I've spoken to all those workers and been told to speak up on their behalf to ask for an extension paper new high school I've asked them any other pupils seen any of the brochures no but they walk along marblewood drive cross the road into the and then the other road land and we got up to 60 or more visitors to actually arrive at wesley with their motorcars and that's it can be more our car park at wesley is totally filled most days um there's doctors and nurses that actually also come into the car park but staff don't they actually park on the outside or um they can try and catch a bus but not always at the times they want them especially the night staff um and um as a city I really beg you to actually give people more time to consider it things that have been done well have been done because people have had an opportunity to have their say they're not something that's actually just been drawn up here's a nice picture of what's going to be done without really thinking about the total community because hereward road belongs to all of christchurch not just us that live around it that is used as a major highway at times for people getting to the airport um it's a favorite place for people saying they're going to the airport they want to be quick they use herewood road straight through around the back when they get down the end of the road so it needs all those things I don't know whether this is when I read the brochure I didn't feel they had um so in summary um if we had to do major improvements in herewood road then it is the duty of our city to extend the consultation time and include the many people who I've actually talked about so that they too can have their say on the any questions thank you very much um I'll just quickly touch on a couple of points because I spoke to yvonne briefly last last night and she mentioned one of the places you've spoke about which I've already passed on to the engagement team but they'll be able to review this um public forum too and make sure that those places that you've discussed are actually engaged with pamphlets and and once everyone spoke and I'll talk to the actual consultation process so the process will be just the three consultations that are on the back here or they're not actually consultations are actually dropping come along we may talk to you if you've got time if there was a big crowd you wouldn't even get in a little old lady like me I'm 84 I'm not likely to be able to in the front with all the young ones trying to have their say so is that all we're getting as far as I'll I'll five minutes is up but I will talk to the if I sit you get this mr chairman counselor davidson and the councillors and staff thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning and request an extension of the closing date and it needs to be longer than one week the reason for this is that consultation plans have not been delivered to residents and possibly home businesses and I include new smart staff in there because my niece this morning said that only she found out about it from me last friday schools are just returning public holidays on monday the 8th of february letterbox or it hasn't arrived this is a significant project of 19 million dollars and I wonder if safer christchurch have been involved in this as well as nurse moored yet there have been no change plan I've seen no change plan providing the impact assessments the readiness conditions identification of the stakeholders I've discovered yesterday I've got a neighbour that successes look like all this information should have been available and so important for the community tonight when making a submission looking at other time frames for control consultation to highlight propose 10 million dollars for christchurch cathedral it had two months consultation for just supporting or declining the 10 million dollar grant yet since all bins they had some major 2019 and then in july and august 2019 after 50 changes they had an extension I just want to highlight a couple of things being very involved in making submissions with mr mitchell and other people in the local government act and the shirley papineau community boards all can christchurch community boards were given a solicitor and I look at the six guiding principles set out in the act of 2002 section 14 which requires all councils to take a consistent approach to their activities is this a consistent approach the guiding there are six guiding principles and I just want to highlight a couple councils must provide anyone who will or may be affected by the decision or anyone who has an interest in the decision with reasonable access to reason to relevant information and these people should be encouraged to express their views to council there are four more on there but I really want to is a very strong written policy there done in november 2019. have you reviewed that and had a look at does that comply with this wheels to wings to wheels or wheels to wings consultation I'm here I am going to I'm being very involved in the community because I believe that this community needs to be consulted well and encouraged to make these submissions thank you for listening for me thank you yvonne um I think one of the most important things for consultation is also public awareness I mean I think what we've heard and seen of late is actually there's quite a lot of public awareness around this consultation and we have listened to obviously you and and carol and we were aware of this public forum coming and also there was another another person that requested an extension we originally looked at one week but um we've had a discussion we're going to extend it out to two weeks so therefore the consultation will close on the 8th of of march instead of what we suggested was the first of this is normally most consultations don't start to a little bit later in in january but it was a decision made by this council of the annual plan to um to do the consultation and design to enable the intersection to be built at gardner's brains here would um so once we put that time and date it basically had to work back from there which created the consultation starting point of the 22nd of january which created a few a little bit of issue with that christmas period um so obviously having a look at it realizing there's some concern out there we have decided to actually extend the consultation period and it's longer than that one week that I emailed you the other day as well but thank you and we'll take them we'll have a look at also the public forums that you've spoken to just so make sure we get the engagement right but the feedback is coming in and it has um there's been quite a lot of us so far too so so thank you for sam well who's made the decision regarding the consultation sam we didn't make it's because sarah we ran them the point of order is why can the councilor not just ask a process question uh because the item is finished there's a public forum and we've moved on to the next item yeah because it doesn't suit aaron sorry yeah no no I'd like to hear from sarah if she's gonna if she's gonna back me up for once
 there's no public forums or deputations of appointments or petitions
Resolution to exclude the public set out on pages 5 and 6 of the agenda and that it be adopted you'll note that the resolution is in relation to one item which is the fifa women's world cup 2023 contract risk management and of course the title of the con um the title of the paper says it all that it is uh a briefing that has to be given um or a paper that has to be considered in confidence due to commercial confidentiality around the conflict contract risk management sam mcdonald is happy to second the motion any discussion I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much thank you you

let's move on to items actually sorry I can't I can't hear you sorry you gonna come to the table welcome if you guys uh would like to give just a brief overview of this report and then we'll take questions thank you we have a presentation if you're able to get that up for us I'll start and that should hopefully pop up there we go so the central city is a key regeneration priority area the biennial report outlines key elements of council-funded regeneration activity between july and december 2020. the report is structured to reflect the five categories of the central city action plan we're just going to run from the report and then we are happy to answer any questions a refreshed version of the central city action plan was endorsed by council in october the new version includes an updated set of activities in response to the challenges posed by covert 19. an evaluation report of the first edition of the central city action plan indicated good progress across most areas there is also good progress towards our inversions that are set out in the central city outcomes framework the graphics measuring progress towards these ambitions are woven throughout the report and are available on the central city insights web page one of our ambitions is that 18 of all christchurch retail sales are made in the four avenues by 2028. we are currently sitting at 19 but this needs to be sustained throughout seasonal differences shown here is a detailed view of central city weekly spending which shows that although there was a substantial loss of trade during the covert 19 lockdown the central city has bounced back strongly the latest spending data is also available on our web pages good progress was made against sites the list while significant progress was made on a further three sites in december the council also initiated a vacant sites program a number of projects were delivered throughout the urban regeneration capital program pictured here is a couple of projects completed this biannual period lighting of the public trust building a collaborative project with bara students to enliven their high street facade and two of the lighting projects that supported christchurch's lit the grant funding for christ for city making partners supported gatfella green lab and the ccba to run events and installations in the city the rate of building central city homes is accelerated year on year in this six month period over 100 homes were completed with another 320 in the pipeline a more detailed breakdown is available on the dashboard we'll also show you uh some new data after this presentation on our web page so the main goal of the central city residential program is to promote housing development and grow the central city population over the next 10 years later's population estimates show the population increased by 8.3 from 2019 to 2020 the central city residential program undertook engagement with residents through a conversation walk series opportunities raised during the walks and are being explored to improve residential immunity in our central city neighborhoods through project 8011 we are looking to promote the lifestyle of living in the central city although christchurch in zed has confirmed that this is not part of their mandate staff are looking into a variety of initiatives including developing web pages that promote central city neighbourhoods and sharing a series of stories from local residents key council produced events include christchurch's lit which attracted 20 000 attendees in july and new year's eve with over 23 000 attendees in the smart christchurch space we saw the development of the bin good game new data sets added to smart view and 20 new pedestrian cameras added progress was made on a number of key central city developments pictured here as the roof trusses added to metro sports the reinstatement of the edmonds band rotunda and a new section of the south frame greenway opened I'm just going to flick over to our data good so this is an example of one of our central city insights web pages which shows the latest data of building consents which shows against our ambition of reaching 20 000 residents by 2028 so here we have the latest population estimates we can see in 2020 that there's 7170 and this is the pipeline of what we need to do to reach 20 000 residents we were going to show you the animated bar graph that we've just added which shows how the central city compares to all our other suburbs and we see that we kind of bounce around over the last 20 years but in recent years we've exceeded most of the greenfield subdivisions and the amount of building consents I might have to circulate a link to that because I'm not sure internet explorer likes this new graph that we've added but we can show you that later if you're happy we can jump through to questions questions jimmy we got into this chat the central city population the chart 8.3 percentage growth unless uh the is a brown brown which line 8.3 percentage so the bottom graph the bottom line here is the estimate for is it three percent yeah oh that's an estimate yeah but how about real real situations real how much percentage it was real so we've had an 8.3 percent growth from 2019 to 2020. that's real yes question figure yes okay based on this figure up to 2028 how many population will be occupied in cbd how many if we do eight percent each year yeah how how far exceed our estimate because we need a three percent to five percent bracket to reach the twenty thousand ambition so we are above yeah okay okay thank you okay andrew um thank you just a couple of questions if I can um keen to know what your view would be of what's driving the increase in the volume of residential development in the central city what would you attribute that increase in the amount of development too I don't think we can put our finger on anything specifically but certainly returning kiwis and those coming from overseas maybe more um be driving a lot of this but but also you know there is a lot of good supply coming on board I mean you know you've got a mixture from your sort of williams court type properties right through to higher end apartments and executive houses so I think it's just that there is a good range and diversity there that appeals to a variety of groups so we're seeing a situation where increased demand is leading to an increased appetite for development that's certainly what we're hearing okay and is there any comment on you know what we're trying to do in central city is to build community demand is one thing um but the demographic that that demand is coming from um plays directly into you know building a real community so have you got any comments on um the the sort of prices that these um developments are attracting the sort of demographic that they're appealing to um you know what sort of price range are we looking at are we seeing prices increasing um and are we looking at you know predominantly outside of the affordable range so just some comments I guess on you know price expectations any price increases that we might be seeing you'd expect to see that in line with demand um and and really just around the type of people that have been attracted to these properties and to be part of this central city community refer you to john scaling here who's leading the program just just jump in there um so back at uh telling the 219 we asked the real estate institute of new zealand to to do a bit of a study around around some of those drivers um and they confirmed what we already suspected in terms of um the target market a lot of activity in the 450 000 to 550 000 range in terms of um units being built um that's what the developers um and the real estate agents told us what they were they were working two you know that's a you know over a year ago now just looking at prices um at the moment um a quick quick scan plenty of um uh homes available you know two two bedroom in this sort of 400 to 550 range um one bedrooms from 250 to 400 so there's a good range there um far fewer available three bedrooms and up um which is what we'd expect um giving that they're they're targeting the one and two bedroom apartment and small townhouse market but there's a there's a lot of activity there and perhaps to add to john's comments before about this being both the demand supply issue I think the supply issue is also is critical and I think the developers that are particularly active in the central city are really getting a measure of how to build in the central city and they're finding sites they're dealing with the ground conditions well and they've got some some good well-tried models which they can now bring to the bring to the market to deliver houses and there's also a big range of houses so we have some high-end apartments being built as well as lots of um more affordable rest of christchurch and particularly for a central city location so plenty of demand plenty of supply are we seeing that drive any change or increase in prices I think prices in general increasing in christchurch as they are across the country um but looking at the the figures today there's not a huge increase in prices in the central city compared to where they were a year ago um we could probably do some some further analysis around that and look at look at a bigger data set and perhaps give you some figures on that I don't have them to hand today I think that would be helpful you know given that we're hearing nationally um you know in excess of 20 um price increases year on year and we're seeing that reflected in some parts of christchurch it would be good to know what the effect is in the central city yes thank you tim yeah thank you the targets are to have people living in the central city but it seems that you know and if you go overseas there are many examples when we started this journey many years ago was you know new york and da da but there are a lot of rentals so you have a large building with flats that's and that's the norm overseas but we seem to be concentrating on ownership what's the plan for instance or are there any plans or any discussions with regards to buildings that have that are planned to be rental so at the moment we're looking at affordable depending on where you are in your earnings so I'm just wondering if that's been anywhere in here um I think that's a it's a good question I think that reflects um I think the way residential buildings are are built in new zealand it's different than some big cities in the world where you get that that buy to rent sorry the build to rent purpose-built buildings so a big apartment block is built entirely with the intention of renting out long term um perhaps as a long-term investment by one owner here the model and it's found in the built for individual sale now that may be to investors um that may be to to owner occupiers new build properties um small newborn properties one and two bedroom low maintenance the first few years very attracted to investors so you can understand why investors like to buy in the central city strong demand as noted um easy to rent out but owner occupiers are also being targeted by some of the developers but I'm not 100 sure that we have that sort of purpose um built to rent market yet in the central city where developers are building big apartment buildings full rental and then holding those apartments buildings rather than selling them as soon as they're built I'm not aware of any um developments but using that prior to the earthquake you know and I used this earlier this morning the example being the para rubber building you know it was full of flats and there are others along um city mall that behind the facade there were a number of flats attached to the upper stairs so I guess that that when we were 2028 and at the moment we've been going for 11 years and obviously we had a very rough start and it's take momentum takes time um and we're I think we're really at about 35 so I guess there has to be an understanding that there is a obviously after an earthquake there is a slight um change in the way we go forward but yeah it's just just interesting can I just um quickly note the levers that council has um to intervene and what you're describing are limited they really rest with um I guess the government to look at in introducing levers that make long-term renting um a more attractive proposition for people there's lots of things that in our legal system and our in our laws actually disincentivize that but the other the other thing that I just wanted to remind council is a part of the project 8011 program that you signed off includes looking at housing diversity so the team continue to look at and investigate options to see how we can bring a diverse range of form but also the the type the tendencies that the other kind of diversity that you can get but again there's limited opportunity for council to intervene in there having said that you have provided some loan facilities in the past and that's one of the levers that you continue to have you only then anne thank you um I think that's a really interesting point that tim's touched on do we are we measuring the rate of home ownership within the four abs so we have that data through statistics new zealand and we can see the rates of owner occupiers and we look at that by neighborhood as well so what's that been showing what's the trend there so we can definitely gather some more information on that it's not currently on this dashboard but it might be a good addition to add in the future yeah um so we find that there is quite high rates of renting in the central city and some areas have higher rates of owner occupiers but definitely in the east of the central city be really interesting information because I think yeah it's quite interesting about that whole home ownership issue um just I was going to ask in terms of um you made some comment about developers are getting really good at this I was just interested in what outcomes we're seeing in terms of urban design I guess my sense is we're seeing a deterioration again in the urban design outcomes is that a fair comment or is it I mean I know what's permissible under the district plan is very um reduced in terms of urban design but just putting the legal side to you know one putting putting the legal stuff to one side do we get a sense of are we getting good urban design outcomes or improving our urban design outcomes in the central city or is it deteriorating I think I can only really refer you back to the work that was reported to you a few months ago by the urban design team that you know there were some gains in in many areas and there are still some areas for work it'll appear to be speculation I think from our point of view at this stage okay can I yeah but where we're providing direct financial assistance do we have any controls in urban design or on things like retention of trees it's it's not a criteria within for example the um development we provide rates funded dc um contributions to people it's not a criteria within the dc rebate scheme or anything like that um and the final question is um there's lots of mapping going on and it's someone who's just been through the tree policy hearing um I just wanted do we have any tool that's measuring the um this is the the ecology and the sustainability and the trees in the central city in terms of carbon like do we have any sort of tool that's showing what's happening in terms of green space and trees within the central city contrasted with the development that's occurring we've certainly got um records of obviously parks and open space that council run and operate and anything I think understanding how that's changing over time is not something we developed at this stage but that may be another area yeah I guess I look at the photos of the south frame and it I mean for those of us that were here at the time we expected a beautiful green campus style cycleway going through and we certainly haven't_''_2469.52 got that but I guess I am a little bit concerned that we don't have enough green space in parts of the central city and I know previously for example um the community board and the council had a plan to acquire little parklets and you know alleyways through in the inner city east for example where there was a gap so really interested if there was anything that we could understand of terms of what's happening and then have a strategic approach thank you I mean it's something I guess we've been looking at in the context of the climate change strategy as well you know very clear crossovers there but at this stage that's very early thinking yeah cool it is great thank you um just uh thinking about getting families into the inner city and in different housing models you know three bedroom four bedroom places um and looking at different uh ways of getting people into home ownership through shared equity and that sort of thing rent to own are those the sorts of things carolyn that you were indicating that you were looking at and cool thank you within the project 8011 workstream there is there is a an area that's looking at alternative housing and how we can support alternative housing um there has today obviously been some direct direct support um but but apart from that we're also looking at um talking with alternative housing providers and this is everything from social housing through to co-housing groups and how how we can support them to consider the central city for for projects um and those generally aimed at um long-term tenure um pathways to owner occupying larger homes um to accommodate larger families um so all those sort of aspects have been been discussed with co-housing providers and what what are their the central city for those sort of developments um and how can council support those those those sort of developments going forward that would be great to have that feedback you know that knowledge the understanding thank you wow on the dc rebates um I didn't want to make any kind of guesses from the data so could you um give a comment on kind of what you think the uptake will be over say the next year to two years because it looks like it will be sort of used you know relatively well it has been relatively slow over the last six months of this right so I'm asking you looking to see um sort of more um more of the qualifying developments of increasing the amount over the next six to months to a year or two years I i don't have unfortunately the latest figures on where the the dc rebate funding is at but clearly if we if we get a big increase in development then that fund will be used up more quickly um we could probably come back to you figure stand unfortunately and looking at the um graph on the residential building consents with um homes with consents that have been issued but not started in homes under development there's a lot with consent but only a few relatively that are actually starting to be under development so to me it would look like they uptake my increase as time goes by I'd like the rate of update yeah so actually the graph that's on the screen at the moment shows this this has actually been a in the last year there's been a big upswing in developments to be completed over 400 last year and yeah as can you say there's actually quite a bit in the pipeline and we suspect more to come on it's quite early in the year so by the end of the year those figures could actually look um even higher than that so there's a lot on the way all right thank you I'm happy to move this report off a second and thank you all those in favor aye opposed did you want just to highlight that um yeah I commend staff for the report it's really good I do think we need to think about the sustainability and the ecology in the central city and um I just think it's really important I know through the tree hearing um process policy process we will be coming with some recommendations to council but I think what's really critical is measuring what's happening in terms of green space um ironically when you when you look at this report you see the um on on one of the pages um 36 you see reference to the south frame greenway um and to call that a greenway you know it's it's really not um and so there is a part of our central city that is really devoid of green space and and trees and I do think we need to start turning our mind to that particularly where we see intensification and often what we see is with that intensification uh very mature trees being removed and not adequate replacement in terms of the the environmental impact so um I think is better than doing it today but I just wanted to acknowledge the work that staff are doing and I do think we need to be mindful of the issue around home ownership and also um speculative investment properties being built as well so you know it would be good to make sure that the incentives that we're providing are going to helping people be able to afford either to rent or own a home not just creating additional wealth for people that are already some of the wealthiest wealthiest in our city or in our country so I look forward to just having that conversation at some stage cheers thank you anyone else all those in favor may peace be wide spread may the sea be like greenstone a pathway for us all this day bind us together you
Everyone it's time to commence the meeting could I invite councillor templeton to give the karakia to mathag I have apologies from councillor james daniels and note that counselor james goff is joining us by video conference with somebody please um move that the apology from councillor daniels be accepted councillor cotter second to councillor templeton I'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that's carriage there are no to
Okay thank you move on uh move back to item um six uh naval point thai um development plan uh can I invite councillor turner to present this on behalf of the banks peninsula community board thank you very much so um this was discussed and um much of the matters in this report were actually decided upon under delegation by the community board um at the community board meeting um there's been a lot of work done by staff and I would certainly acknowledge christine bowe and her team for the huge amount of work that's been done over quite a long period of time um working with a large number of stakeholders at naval point um including the coast guard including the naval point club and a number of other stakeholders there were a number of deputations to the community board meeting and a number of matters raised in those deputations that were discussed at the community board all in relation to the naval point development plan and the decisions by the community board that you see in this report were made largely with the support content of um consensus where there certainly had been some contention around some of these issues in previous weeks and months so certainly that was an achievement at that community board meeting which was well received by the stakeholders so the important thing to note is that the community board has got delegation for the approval of the naval point development plan um that approval and the authority to conclude the leases with partners is contained in the part c resolutions in this report so the substantive matter for council to consider today and in fact the only substantive matter for council to consider as regards this report um for council to consider today is matters relating to the closure of the magazine bay marina so these matters are detailed in paragraph 5.15 to 5.22 of the report that's in front of us the magazine bay marina was constructed in the 1980s by the then littleton harbour board and there was a plan to create a more extensive marina to be protected by a floating breakwater a continuous floating breakwater that was initiated in the 1990s so the breakwater and in fact part of the marina and the number of vessels that were moored in the marina at the time were destroyed in a major storm in october 2000 um so that resulted in damage to the floating breakwater loss of part of the marina structure and the loss of a number of vessels that were murdered there um the marina remained in its damaged state there were a number of proposals that were put forward but not progressed in the meantime the marina remained in its damaged state and then the next action was when littleton port company in 2018 constructed the tayana marina which has certainly worked and has been an additional asset both to the port and to the community and to the users of that marina so that leaves us now in a position where as part of the naval point development plan there is a need to resolve issues pertaining to the um magazine bay marina there are seven remaining birth holders there um and there's detail in the resolution and in the report as to how the licenses that they hold can an end either naturally or under the terms of the licenses or by negotiation that then will allow the remains of the marina to be dealt with according to the provisions in the development plan the proposals in the development plan which is to retain a small part of the marina and essentially to tidy up the area so that it will have a use and a role as part of the overall naval development plan but the key point for us today is that the development plan resolutions themselves have already been approved by the community board under delegation the matter for us to deal with is just this matter relating to the naval point the magazine bay marina thank you um tim has a question yeah my understanding was that we when we were looking at this we were looking at a a cut down version because the complete version is actually about 27 million dollars so I was wondering how this will affect that the magazine bay marina we're only dealing with the magazine bayer marina okay thank you the other matters are the best way yep I mean I don't know whether there is an answer from staff as to um the answer in relation to the question that tim's asked I mean this my understanding is that this is um contained within the budget for the first phase of the marina of the um naval point development that's correct my my concern is that if we don't put a piece of sedum fees aside for pieces of this development we won't have a header a view of how much we're actually spending on this project these bits and pieces because we've got the gp so we've got the sailing event which we've got to um have some of that area sorted for that there are going to be pieces here we I thought we had agreed that we will do a cut down version of the overall plan to make it safe or whatever it was but it just seems that we're doing bits and pieces where's the overall plan for the amount of money that we're spending bits and pieces I could take this matter offline because it's to do with the general project rather than a specific issue that we've been asked to approve which is the closure of the magazine bay marina once the existing licenses expire or terminated in accordance with their licence terms and conditions and I'm wondering if whether we could just have that resolution resolved and then perhaps get an update a briefing note from staff just as to an update around the overall project and the decision that the community board made would that be would that work I mean people were here to we're here prepared to discuss questions around the closure of the magazine bay marina so it would that be okay tim if we did that yeah yeah okay there any other questions um andrew you'd like to move seconded by pauline is there any debate I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that's carrie no thank you you're um your opposition is noted thank you tim thank you
Did all the meetings actually carry on so just professionally sorry I can't I can't hear you sorry do we have stuff john and laura are you going to come to the table welcome if you guys uh would like to give just a brief overview of this report and then we'll take questions thank you we have a presentation if you're able to get that up for us um I'll start and that should hopefully pop up there we go so the central city is a key regeneration priority area the biennial report outlines key elements of council-funded regeneration activity between july and december 2020. the report is structured to reflect the five categories of the central city action plan which is going to run through a short five-minute presentation on the key highlights from the report and then we are happy to answer any questions a refreshed version of the central city action plan was endorsed by council in october the new version includes an updated set of activities in response to the challenges posed by covert 19 an evaluation report of the progress across most areas there is also good progress towards our inversions that are set out in the central city outcomes framework the graphics measuring progress towards these ambitions are woven throughout the report and are available on the central city insights web page one of our ambitions is that 18 of all christchurch retail sales are made in the four avenues by 2028. we are currently sitting at 19 but this needs to be sustained throughout seasonal differences shown here is a detailed view of central city weekly spending which shows that although there was a substantial loss of trade during the covert 19 lockdown the central city has bounced back strongly the latest spending data is also available on our web pages good progress was made against sites on the barrier sites list four properties were removed from the list while significant progress was made on a further three sites in december the council also initiated a vacant sites program a number of projects were delivered throughout the urban regeneration capital program pictured here is a couple of projects completed this biennial period lighting of the public trust high street facade and two of the lighting projects that supported christchurch's lit the grant funding for christ for city making partners supported gatfiller green lab and the ccba to run events and installations in the city the rate of building central city homes is accelerated year on year in this six month period over 100 homes were completed with another 320 in the pipeline a more detailed breakdown is available on the dashboard we'll also show you some new data after this presentation on our web page so the main goal of the central city residential program is to promote housing development and grow the central city population over the next 10 years later's population estimates show the population increased by 8.3 from 2019 to 2020. overall this is a 20 increase since 2012. during 2020 the central city residential program undertook engagement with residents through a conversation walk series opportunities raised during the walks and now being explored to improve residential immunity in our central city neighborhoods through project 8011 we are looking to promote the lifestyle of living in the central city although christchurch their mandate staff are looking into a variety of initiatives including developing web pages that promote central city neighborhoods and sharing a series of stories from local residents key council-produced events include christchurch's lit which attracted 20 000 attendees in july and new year's eve with over 23 000 attendees in the smart christchurch space we saw the development of the bin good game new data sets added to smart view and 20 new pedestrian cameras added progress was made on a number of key central city developments pictured here as the roof trusses added to metro sports the reinstatement of the edmonds ban rotunda and a new section of the south frame greenway opened I'm just going to flick over to our data good so slideshow sorry guys so this is an example of one of our central city insights web pages which shows the latest data of building consents which shows against our ambition of reaching 20 000 residents by 2028 so here we have the latest population estimates we can see in 2020 that there's 7170 and this is the pipeline of what were going to show you the animated bar graph that we've just added which shows how the central city compares to all our other suburbs and we see that we kind of bounce around over the last 20 years but in recent years we've exceeded most of the greenfield subdivisions and the amount of building consents I might have to circulate a link to that because I'm not sure internet explorer likes this new graph that we've added but we can show you that later if you're happy we can jump through to questions questions jimmy we got into this chart the central city population the chart 8.3 percentage growth this uh the is a brown brown line or is the accounts estimate estimated line which which line 8.3 percentage the bottom graph the bottom line here is the estimate for is it three percent okay oh that's an estimate yeah about how about real real situations real how much percentage it was real so we've had a 8.3 percent growth from 2019 to 2020. that's real yes question figure yes okay will be occupied in cbd how many if we do eight percent each year yeah how many far exceed our estimate because we need a three percent to five percent bracket to reach the twenty thousand ambition so we are above yeah okay okay thank you I guess andrew um thank you just a couple of questions if I can um keen to know what your view would be of what's driving the increase in the volume of residential development in the central city what would you attribute that increase in the amount of development to I don't think we can put our finger on anything specifically but certainly returning kiwis and those coming from over overseas um maybe more accepting of more denser urban living environments and that may be driving a lot of this but but also you know there is a lot of good supply coming on board I mean you know you've got a mixture from your sort of williams court type properties right through to higher end apartments and executive houses so I think it's just that there is a good groups so are we seeing a situation where increased demand um is leading to an increased appetite for development that's certainly what we're hearing okay and is there any comment on you know what we're trying to do in central city is to build community demand is one thing um but the demographic that that demand is coming from um plays directly into you know building a real community so have you got any comments on um the the sort of prices that these um developments are attracting the sort of demographic that they're appealing to um you know what sort of price range are we looking at are we seeing prices increasing um and are we looking at properties that could be described as affordable or are they you know predominantly outside of the affordable range so just some comments I guess on you know price expectations any price increases that we might be seeing you'd expect to see that in line with demand um and and really just around the type of people that have been attracted to these properties and to be scallon here who's leading the program just just jump in there um so back at uh telling uh to nt19 we asked the real estate institute of new zealand to to do a bit of a study around around some of those drivers and they confirmed what we already suspected in terms of um the target market a lot of activity in the 450 000 to 550 000 range in terms of units being built that's what the developers and the real estate agents told us what they were they were working to you know that's a you know over a year ago now um just looking at prices um at the moment um a quick quick scan of real estate pages at the moment reveal there's plenty of um uh homes available you know two two bedroom in this sort of 400 to 550 range um one bedrooms from 250 to 400 so there's a good range there um far fewer available three bedrooms and up um which is what we'd expect giving that they're targeting the one and two bedroom apartment a lot of activity there and perhaps to add to john's comments before about this being both the demand supply issue I think the supply issue is also is critical and I think the developers that are particularly active in the central city are really getting a measure of how to build in the central city and they're finding sites they're dealing with the ground conditions as well and they've got some some good well tried models which they can now bring to the bring to the market to deliver houses and there's also a big range of houses so we have some high-end apartments being built as well of lots of um more affordable townhouses which are you know reasonably affordable compared with the rest of christchurch and particularly for a central city location so plenty of demand plenty of supply are we seeing that drive any change or increase in prices um I think prices in general are increasing in christchurch as they are across the country um but looking at the the the figures today there's not a huge increase in a year ago um we could probably do some some further analysis around that and look at look at a bigger data set and perhaps give you some figures on that I don't have them to hand today I think that would be helpful you know given that we're hearing nationally um you know in excess of 20 um price increases year on year and we're seeing that reflected in some parts of christchurch it would be good to know what the effect is in the central city yes thank you tim yeah thank you the targets are to have people living in the central city but it seems that you know and if you go overseas there are many places in the central cities whether it's in the examples when we started this journey many years ago was you know new york and but there are a lot of rentals so you have a large building with flats and that's the norm overseas but we seem to be concentrating on ownership what's the plan for instance or are there any plans or any to be rental so so at the moment we're looking at affordable depending on where you are in your earnings so I'm just wondering if that's been anywhere in here um I think it's a it's a good question I think that reflects um I think the way residential buildings are built in new zealand it's different than some big cities in the world where you get that that buy to rent sorry the build to rent purpose-built buildings so a big apartment block is built entirely with the intention of renting out long-term um perhaps as a long-term investment by one owner um here the model and it's found in the central city is very much individual apartments individual towns are built for individual sale now that may be to investors um occupiers new build properties um small newborn properties one and two bedroom low maintenance the first few years very attractive to investors so you can understand why investors like to buy in the central city strong demand as noted um easy to rent out um but owner occupiers are also'm not 100 sure that we have that sort of purpose built to rent market yet in the central city where developers are building big apartment buildings full rental and then holding those apartment buildings rather than saving them as soon as they're built I'm not aware of any um developments but using that prior to the earthquake you know and I used this earlier this morning the example being the para rubber building you know it was full of flats and there are others along um city mall that behind the facade there were a number of flats attached to the upper stairs so I guess that that when we were looking at 20 000 people in central city by 2028 and at the moment we've been going for 11 years and obviously we had a very rough start and it's take momentum takes time um and we're I think we're really at about 35 so I guess there has to be an understanding that there is a obviously after an earthquake there is a slight um change in the way we go um quickly note the levers that council has to intervene and what you're describing are limited they really rest with um I guess the government um to look at in introducing levers that make long-term renting um a more attractive proposition for people there's lots of things that in our legal system and our in our laws actually disincentivize that um but the other um the other thing that I just wanted to remind councillors a part of the project 8011 program that you signed off includes looking at housing diversity so the team continue to um look at and investigate options to see how we can bring a diverse range of houses to the market and that includes not just the form but also the the type the tendencies that the other kind of diversity that you can get but again there's limited opportunity for council to intervene in there having said that you have provided some loan facilities in the past and that's one of the levers that you continue to have thank you um I think that's a really interesting point that rate of home ownership within the four abs so we have that data through statistics new zealand and we can see the rates of owner occupiers and we look at that by neighborhood as well so what's that been showing what's the trend there so we can definitely gather some more information on that it's not currently on this dashboard but it might be a good addition to add in the future yeah so we find that

think from our point of view at this stage okay can I go through my opinion on it yeah I refer back to the work that is a separate work stream um through what I've been designing yeah but where we're providing direct financial assistance do we have any controls in urban design or on things like retention of trees it's not a criteria dc um contributions to pick to develop it's not a criteria within the dc rebate scheme or anything like that um and the final question is um there's lots of mapping going on and as someone who's just been through the tree um policy hearing um I just wanted do we have any tool that's measuring the um this is the the ecology and the sustainability and the trees in the central city in terms of carbon like do we have any sort of tool that's showing what's happening in terms of green space and trees within the central city contrasted with the development that's occurring we've certainly got um records of obviously parks and open space that council run

tree hearing policy I think is better than doing it today but I just wanted to acknowledge the work that staff are doing and I do think we need to be mindful of the issue around home ownership and also um speculative investment properties being built as well so you know it would be good to make sure helping people be able to afford either to rent or own a home not just creating additional wealth for people that are already some of the wealthiest wealthiest in our city or in our country so I look forward to just having that conversation at some stage cheers thank you anyone else all right all those in favor all right hi carrie thank you I'll get uh anne to close the medium with may peace be widespread may the sea be like ringstone a pathway for us all this day bind us together
And we'll continue item 12 on the agenda this is the draft letter of expectation from christchurch city council to cchl the holdings company over the break we over the adjourned men we've made some suggested changes to that draft and they were made by councillors coker kyoen and johansen and we're going to put them on the screen and we'll be debating these with the agreement of the mover and seconder that being mike davidson and pauline cotter we would put them in as the letter to be debate under debate all right so in the first instance and and can I just get an indication from you both that given you know what's being proposed that you're willing to uh have these if all agree if agreed by all councillors uh or the majority becomes the letter under debate so then we can really talk meaningfully about this you okay yeah I'm happy that the amendments have been put forward from the other councillors are included into the um substantive now instead of putting them up as amendments and I guess the second fine thank you yes okay right so heading straight from the top the amendment is in yellow it's by councillor coker as you can see and it's just removal of divestment of so are you going to ask officers to comment oh I'll pick a pardon yeah yeah oh changes are amazing about the changes you're aware of the changes do you have any comments on them um yes to remove the opportunity to divest non-performing companies or where the environments changed and redbus would be the one of note where they have lost that you know they lost the tenders and therefore the whole reason for red bus existing was no longer um there and therefore that we shouldn't restrict cchl from making um making a decision or at least having an inquiry as to whether um companies should be divested okay so this is not a debate and it's um more discussion just to get us forward so just a comment that's all right yes and yes and from councillor coker as the promoter of this how do you think um well it's clear what um I'm meaning there and I think I'll leave it to the meeting to decide whether they accept or not accept pauline staff um if the word divestment was removed that would not prevent cchl from considering a divestment if they found it necessary is that correct yes it doesn't have to be there um no I think what we're wanting though is that we realize you have limited resources and the resources should be applied to where you get the best return hence the need to divest in some cases but you're right it doesn't stop cchl themselves from doing it yeah thank you okay any other questions jimmy what's the difference between the term the uh diverse man and the disposition of process what's the difference between divestment and disposable yeah dyspo any other questions and galloway thank you just um whether we and whether there is investment or divestment then um cchl has to come to us to bring proposals they can't just go ahead and do that is that correct with us in order to make a decision and can you talk to that please you're strategic I guess it depends on how major it is um and you know we've got to remember that cchl executives staff executives the chief executive of both they talk to each other on a regular basis and you know if there's any proposal that the that cchl is considering around just divesting or disposing of an asset you would expect that that conversation would have been had and a determination made as to whether it needs to come to the council to be considered so just following and if we took the word divestment out would that mean that they actually couldn't do that wouldn't stop them from no it wouldn't stop there okay thank you aaron so just to check if we go with this amendment could that have major financial implications for our group of companies and in turn the council only if the board made the decision not to divest anything because they felt they couldn't so no I don't think so trying to send a clearer direction on what we are looking for the board to do right okay cool uh councillor scandret viazoom thank you um I guess one of the questions when we talk about divestment is and ian mentioned with regards to the scale of it when we talk about the in the original version there was um for the greater good of um christchurch so the thing there that was missing was actually its con its contact with council and with the terrorist example you know we need to know all the risks and I don't believe we have those and with the original letter the only time that is really mentioned is when it's with climate change and I think you know any major move like that from one of our companies through cchl has to be discussed with the council because the council's focus is on the greater good for christchurch and sometimes the companies like cial and others are looking at what's best for them in relation to count to the city and I think there is a difference there I'm just wondering how we can how or remedy that I should say there is a comment about considering the whole of christchurch perspective that's at the bottom of page one so um under the prosperous economy so we have recognized that sometimes that they need to consider the whole of christchurch rather than just the company itself and but that but that I i totally agree but the part that's missing for me is when where were the risks in the risk analysis and we never saw that and that's there are risks I've asked these questions about specific things which I won't mention in public and I am still concerned about those and it's not covered I don't believe or it should be covered in that last paragraph you've mentioned with regards to maybe um just um a bit of a good relationship good communication with council with regards to the definition of what's good for christchurch look I don't have the statement of intent in front of me but it's quite a lengthy document that of the council all those sort of things this is just simply a letter of expectations of what is to go into or what the council expects to see in the statement of intent once we see that you maybe want maybe you would like to comment on on the contents of the statement perhaps it's been that I talk offline with you into to kind of establish what I'm really concerned about thank you I think it's also um important to understand that this is this a step in the process is the letter of the expectation this it's not the end end game it's the opening gambit right any other comments or questions about this amendment yes right I i I feel that my is it should stay in because we don't want to tie these guys up to that they're scared to make a decision we we're giving them the license to invest in things and if they if they've got a something that's a fizzer in front of them they should be able to just say of having to run back to us all the time but that's just my view for you mr chair we have had that answer that this does not stop them from doing that taking that word out yeah some people take what's written as the as the real thing but anyway good governors okay so this is a proposed amendment um and is there any any uh opposition you don't need to we'll put it in one go yeah okay we'll go to the uh and see the in the next paragraph down there written oh sorry just go back up the original motion is there and that's the edit but we'll get council davidson to talk about that when we when we put the motion all right and you'll discuss it in debate right next to the next one please the next amendment oh piggy pardon sorry carry on yani I just wanted to raise the concern with this particular section and um I'm very supportive of this amendment I'm concerning concern that the context of the wording around than some of the other social cultural and environmental outcomes that we should be believing in and I know someone's given the example of red bus I don't know how many councils were here when we had a public reputation to a long-term plan or an annual plan that talked about why red bus was such a good bus operator in terms of the way the buses were operated so sometimes things may not make a lot of money but they provide a community benefit that's important to our city if strategically for example we wanted to have a public transport operation in the city then you know we've really lost that opportunity by what we've done in my view so I think decisions like that should be coming to the full council and I would be very supportive of including divestment being deleted from this section especially because of the context for the other things that's in here all right any other comments questions those decisions do come to council like red bus came to council so yeah I will add from the bus was that they didn't get the contracts so they they weren't giving getting going to get revenue the key important thing to repeat councillor cotter has just said there are rules in which what comes to council and what doesn't and major decisions of strategic importance do come and you decide redbus came to this council all I'm wanting to do is to get both a report and a briefing that explains what's in the report so we can have a discussion any questions about that thank you right to the next amendment in the next paragraph counselor coker again and we can see it how they complement the balance of the board could you just describe a little bit about that um the reason for this is just so that the councillors can have um a deeper understanding of when cchl um recommends appointees to boards um yeah that's basically it so it's to see um if we if there's a board and they are looking for a new appointee what the makeup of their board is and what skills and where the gaps are and how a proposed appointee fills those gaps any comment from staff on this not necessary okay any comment from council sorry my comment is I i have no issue that I think it's a a good amendment okay uh councillors members and just wondering if we just scroll back down does is is this already covered in the pr in the process and the in the principle presented from you on the process you conduct to appoint members to boards isn't that the sort of thing that would be involved in that yes no I thought it was appropriate to put that amendment because I believe the first paragraph is a general process rather than the second paragraph being more specific about particular board appointments complement yeah okay clear any other comments on this amendment no right to the next one uh and we'll get we'll carry on with council of coker's amendments that's the yellow one here no we'll go to the yellow one first and uh can you comment on that for us to start uh to make the sentence more clear because the way that I could originally interpret it is that people that employees or you could be getting given bonuses um and I'd rather we weren't giving bonuses based on performance but rather decreasing people's remuneration if they're not doing a good job which is the risk based yeah component you're talking about okay any comment from staff firstly okay counsellors any issues with this there's an amendment and just just one wondering if you could just clarify a little bit more what you mean by this I'm not really sure could I ask staff to comment on it because it was diane who gave her me too um diane please I suggested that because council coca was concerned that bonuses were only add-on bonuses and I did point out that in a lot of circumstances a person's remuneration has a risk-based component to it so that they have a salary but a big chunk of that is at risk so if they're not performing it is at risk um and so that might make it clearer and address her concern about bonuses always being on top rather than holding people to account for performing comfortable with that and I'm just a bit worried that it's linked to performance and how you know that's the worry is do you see that being a risk it's in itself performance-based paid performance or hopefully it means that they um they will perform I wasn't against the idea of remuneration being linked to performance as such but more that people could get additional bonuses and pay greater amounts if their performance is deemed to be good and we're wanting obviously good performance but we want to know the cap on people's pay I suppose is what the purpose of this is in this case there's been some reading removed that actually could have been misinterpreted as bonuses so this title I think it it's a bit more uh it clarifies it that the with the risk-based um wording in there jani you have a question comment just uh would this mean like you know um covert our companies so their performance is way down that the cio salaries get reduced to in line with that why would you do that I don't comment on that would it not depend on what the arrangements are this is remember this is within the commercial company within the companies and it'll be prescriptive as to what the uh component um remuneration right the flip side is say we get a major earthquake and suddenly we get all this stuff coming in through the port and their volumes are going up does that mean that they get the rewards well well I i my answer to that is that it's written in black and white for them and that's how they operate okay and that's the way it should should be let's be fair it's contractual yeah aaron yeah I think the key word there that melanie's left in his performance so those are external issues that is not part of the person's performance they aren't influence on the organization but not their actual performance so when there's a it's called at risk um so there's a percentage of the ce salary for the my last nine years there it was that we had um they had a salary and they get all of the salary if the board agrees that the at risk portion is paid so that's that's how it was done there so it's not strange to this town okay any other questions right are there any more amendments below that I can't see the whole thing right then we go back to uh the one in green which is councillor kewan and could you just speak to this amendment to start us yeah so it was just adding into we've often said for years about the restraint referring to the top end but I mean the the top in salaries uh were operating in uh a a field where lots of people have paid those sort of salaries but the real issues more it's not about the top end so much it's the bottom end and the gap between the two so this is just to moving salaries don't be moving the top end because 3 of 500 000 dollars a lot different to three percent of twenty thousand dollars in actual dollar terms so it's it's about addressing the gap so but when you do only percentages the gap grows and uh so it's about addressing that because you know um like someone told me last week um plumbers and drain layers save more lives than doctors every year globally so okay work that out so you've put it on the table to be added to the letter of expectation can we just get any comment from the staff if any I only made the comment before that there's a bit of disjunct between expecting cchl to exercise restraint in the level of senior executives and narrowing the gap between the highest and the lowest remuneration because it's not just um the higher level which we were talking about in that first sentence um the second point that um counselor at cuen is making covers the whole gambit of the cchl family that's fine it it it that it could be best demonstrated um there may be a response from cchl to that okay all right any other comments around the members no okay right those are the amendments to the letter there's an additional resolution has been proposed by councillor johansen and now we see it here in the green number two there because number one is we will be looking at this updated version as we've just discussed uh number two here this is an additional resolution so I'll give you a moment to have a look at that and then I'll ask counselor johansson to speak to it oh I'm happy to second it oh hang on him no when we're adding we're adding this to it to the the whole thing you'll have a chance shortly um so do you want to speak to it yani um I've got you tim yeah I mean as as councillors um may be we we have in 2016 asked for a governance manual of how we give direction to our companies and how we work with them so it's nearly five years later and we still don't have it but in the meantime the government as I understand have changed the legislation and they now enable us to do what they call a statement of expectation and I was really taken when I read the auckland council review into ccos around the use of that versus the letter of expectation and what was quite clear from that report was that letters of expectation are often too vague that they don't really address the strategic issues and that there's a better mechanism which is called a statement of expectation so I'm suggesting rather than have a big debate today about all the different issues which I would have preferred but we're pretty sure on time um that we look at that new mechanism to address things like and this is um according to the legislation or in the auckland review how the cease how cchl could conduct relations with the governing body and community boards uh maori entities in the public um the council's expectation of cchl and individual ccos and is really critical to which the council expects cchl to consult it when developing significant plans or strategies with its companies and the final one is the council's expectations about chief executive salaries and tenure and I just see that the world has moved on and we can be a lot more prescriptive but we need to get the advice on what's possible and so looking at the statement of expectation with some more detail and advice on february when we're doing the governance manual makes sense and it may have a bit of overlap with the letter of expectation but I think we should be open to it especially because of what we've heard this morning but also because of some of the fundamental problems we've had with getting issues like remuneration addressed in the past thank you I'll say from the chair and as the chair thank you for using this method of uh progressing your your kaupapa okay so um firstly any comment from staff I'll come to you in a minute tim we we discussed this this morning we is the new provision in the act for a statement of um expectations and we're quite happy to engage in the conversation around how that might fit in it's it's not a mandatory um requirement in the act the council may elect to um issue a statement of expectations so let's explore that and get detail around it thank you chair and follow up from ian I think it's important that the report describes exactly what is in the oakland report and what the similarities to what the situation in christchurch is and what the differences are so that you understand what you're making your decisions on and that's fully and clearly explained in the report to finance and performance committee in february thank you uh I'll go to tim scandred on zoom now thank you james I'll always throw up my questions I really do need to do some homework on this difference between the statement of expectation and electrical expectation but thank you very much be here on the 25th of february and you'll get there and you the uh from the members mike just just one thing and I i guess it's for councillor hanson I'm happy it's up to pauline as well to actually have this included straight away to the substantive and he does not need it to be moved as an amendment okay any other comment I was quite keen for it to be separate because I i have a you know in my view this is a better process to get some of the things we want in terms of the legislative expectation so all right but as you said time is is important resolutions I'm happy for it just to be incorporated into the yeah so I'm I'm now going to ask the mover and second that whether you're you agree to having that second part and those amendments in your motion right yes yes yes yes okay so now I open the meeting to debate that is what we're debating above us so that we're clear the updated version with all those colors is what we're debating so I open the so I believe in transparency and I believe that we are working towards becoming more transparent in our decision making I believe in community involvement and decision making and I believe we're also moving well into a much stronger position but I also believe that we must build strong and respectful relationships with our partners and our our family our council family as a council family we need to be able to have opportunities to work things out privately as in any family before we go out to the public with decisions and to give them the opportunity to feedback to our decision-making so this is fundamentally I think about trust and um for example cchl the phrase in here in the loa is cchl should uh make such trade-offs as it considers appropriate from a a whole of christchurch perspective that statement indicates to me a level of trust that we're putting in them that cchl has the right people in place to deliver in a way that is appropriate and this is also from the loa appropriate from a whole of christchurch perspective so we're change develop stronger planning and reporting frameworks to address this to address diversity in appointments to exercise restraint and remuneration and to take into account the public service nature of this role that they have we want them to implement the living wage and that seems to me it seems to me that they are really key and important things it seems that we are running a risk that as council we want to micromanage our council-owned organizations and I think that this could have the effect of reducing the mana of our cchl and I think the loe is a high-level strategic document that details need to be addressed in the sois which are still to be determined and I look forward to an opportunity to work with cchl and to nut out those soi so that we all achieve what we hope for um through through um working together I will be supporting what is what's in front of us today um I wasn't quite ready to speak I haven't thought of anything that much but I just wanted to say really briefly that I um I don't know how long because I've only been here a year and a half but for the first time in a very long time I suspect that this has been a process that we've we've done openly and and with the public um and you know as as their representatives it's not good enough for us to abdicate our responsibility to um to ensure that the the company all our companies are delivering on their values and and I believe that the people of christchurch do want to see stronger action on on climate change they do want a living wage um implemented and they they they want um salary restraint at the top as well um I don't think this this leader um necessarily ticks all those boxes but it's been a really good exercise and um and transparency today kyoto thank you for that uh councillor chen thank you yeah and I think today is quite significant because we have uh you know these are kind of discussion or q in the a and also debate under the circumstances community they're all repaired they are concerned no the the council money particularly for those radio for money so they are very eligible to fully understand all of our uh policies regarding to this issue particularly these are the later expectations we are all aware there is a high level strategic document so we give the proper the strategic direction to all the uh council control on the kind of trading company or the organization sure cchl so our strategic those directions should be more kind of strategic view and also need to fully comply with the council the strategic priority as well as our kind of community outcome there's the the kind of higher priority I'm so happy you know we got into this uh throttle one at least you know generally we fully compliant with this direction the other one is absolutely no any other kind of document is perfect it's impossible so that's wider you know the council will consist of management one and also the governance one we're working together to make this the seated community more better today better that's very very the culture very very important generally speak I'm very happy because while this strategic document consists of five categories prosperous economy a moment that's very important we are all aware we are under the specific circumstances of copyrighting still under this this kind of the the bigger impact you know how do we to overcome those recovery we need to working together council you know all the stuff teaching the all those the partnership as well as why the the community the people we all working together to make the happen the other one to how to rightlize our economy you know to take more kind of coastal effective way for money this kind of and the other one is uh particular the other governance world there's also council expectation because hold on okay what's up briefly okay because what diversity we always mention important but why is real general diversity we review the currently the council trading company actually still not yet achieve our expectation I hope in this generator uh diversity so this direction you know it's a pretty much sorry too long okay uh councillor coker um this letter of expectations is a high level strategic document which we've talked about and it's to our company to cchl and we need to well as we were told the other day our companies have been formed to keep um our politicians basically at arm's length now there's a good reason for that because they're commercial activities however cchou is 100 owned by council and by the people of christchurch and this should always be front of mind and so what we say in this letter I hope is is followed through with the statement of intent that ccahl wrote back to us and that they follow through on what they say and I really look forward to seeing that and I really hope that um the level of trust that um counselor um galloway talked about can be strengthened because at the moment there is a little bit of distrust here and so if we can work together and they can listen to us and we can listen to them I think that would councillor cotter thank you um look I agree with most of what's been said I think this is sort of pitched in the right area now um the original document we felt proud of ourselves because we had strengthened the governance and climate change sections of that but today we've gone even further and we've strengthened their expectation around remuneration levels and we've grown that out from just exercising restraint to actually narrowing the gap and I'm I'm really pleased that we've got that in now um but actually this is very much about good relationships and building trust and and I i don't agree with counselor coca I think that the relationship's working very well and this document outlines very clearly what we expect a year we are continually improving those relationships in our collaboration but whenever we've requested the chief executive or any staff to attend our meetings that's happened every time and we've held many workshops with cchl and this letter of expectation outlines our wish to continue those so that we can ensure effective regarding yanI's amendment resolution motion there um I really support receiving the report on the governance manual and hopefully we'll workshop that as well prior and and be considering the pros and cons and appropriateness or not of using a statement of expectation in the future and up to that point I've got an open mind on this until we've done the work on that but I really look forward to doing that work and I'm also looking forward to the statement of intent coming back but um we're going forward with this we are building continually building good relationships with cchl and I'd like to thank our chief executive there too for the great work that you're doing there and our staff working together and thanks staff for the continued work on this you've probably been pulling your hair out but I feel that we've got it to a good place today thank you thank you uh councillor major yep I or the only thing I worry about is that we we trust these guys they'll do what pressure on them so much that we we remove their agility to do things um that they do best we they they know how to run their businesses and that they don't need us to come but I know we've got to have a an overarching lens on them but it just worries me that we might be trying to cramp this style too much that's the only thing I'm worried about it's all right short and pithy any other counsellors counselor johansson thank you so to start off with I just wanted to raise um a few concerns about the letter of expectation I appreciate some of the changes that have been made but to me it still doesn't go far enough it's not specific enough uh in the right places and it still leaves open a huge room for interpretation um I just want to start off with the auckland council review and appreciate that that's different they are a different environment but the principles of that review that have been identified I think are actually pretty sound and just made of the notion that ccos are commercial entities they are not some of their activities are commercial in nature and they must often exercise commercial judgment and business expertise but at heart they are community-owned entities that exist to provide services to those who partly or wholly fund them aucklanders as a result they must be more conscious of the community expectations and appropriately balanced commercial and public interests it then goes on to say that there's significant improvements that can be made around how they get strategic direction and that's really about being much more focused through a statement of the expectation to be very clear about things like the remuneration uh policies to be really clear about the opportunity for the community to be consulted with in terms of significant strategic direction there's a lot of other things in here but at essence the key concern I have is that for the last few years we've been putting in similar resolutions around murineration and we have simply not seen the restraint that is anywhere near the reality of what the ordinary person in chief executives on close to a million dollars and when within a short space of time their salaries have just about doubled or increased by a third to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars I don't think it's acceptable that for over for nearly 10 years we've been trying to get a living wage which was started by the cleaners from the airport coming into this chamber asking to be paid a living wage so that they could support their family that they still don't have a living wage and we're told that there's no money and it's not affordable and yet we've seen the chief executive's salary from the airport alone go up um from 2016 from 650 000 a year to 2018 to 836 000 in the same time you can't tell me there's not enough money to pay people a living wage in our city through our council companies and despite the words that we've put in time and time again we have not seen that happen so we need to be much more of expectation that fails to mention a significant issue such as the terrorist airport the community deserves to know what our direction is to our holding company and to our companies about a significant development such as that and I'm really disappointed that we do not have anything in there that expresses a view thank you uh councillor scandret are you standing by uh thank you james um I guess for me the the leaderboard expectation is such an important document with regards to the directors on companies have a um first and foremost their obligations to the company and the companies have an obligation to do what's best for christchurch through cchl we hope that they do this but we need that content I think we need better contact and that's been really um highlighted I think with the terrorist discussion but when we get these and they are sales pitches we need a 360 degree look at the proposals that are coming up for what is best for christchurch but as councillors our sole purpose is what is best for christchurch and I believe that think that through the letter of expectation we must make sure that that is clear that we need that good expectation we need the sales pitch but the realistic outcomes that could um happen with those side issues and that's been missing for me in the in the briefings that we've had and I'd hope that this document and in the future will lay that out very clearly thank you councillor kewan do you wish to make a comment oh that's pretty much all been said and I got my little one liner in there about closing the gap so good on me kia ora before I go to the mover of the of the motion um just from the chair I i want to underline the fact that we are progressing the process of dealing with our company cchl by the governance manual discussion that we're going to be having on the 25th of february and that's really important an important output from today's debate and discussion so I'm pleased about that and and I appreciate that councillor johansen given your and believe in that you were willing to uh leave it at that and we'll work on it in the near future so I also want to thank the staff for all the work that they've done to date for this much appreciated and particularly the work that was done today because we had to do a few amendments and to that I'll add my thanks to my colleagues here as members for being able to negotiate and add those amendments to the original motion so with that I say thank you very much and I'm supporting this motion as it sits on the table and to the mover who has the last word eight minutes wasn't it no no no not eight minutes but and I will note that you could have had eight minutes but you were generally gonna have them all together to just have the three at the end I'd like to thank you james for your cheering actually it's been excellent um and also my colleagues I think this has been a good discussion we have ended up we need to improve the process to get to this this point I think then we get better as we move move forward I think you know there's a few decisions we make during the term that really affect I guess the direction of of the city and the letter of expectation is one of those decisions so it's actually a really important piece of work that we we do and we need to make sure that we do it correctly and actually indicate what we want our companies to do through the through the holding company um so it is actually good to have this in a public setting this this debate um because we all we all want our companies to be successful and we need them to be successful but success should not be measured just by the size of a dividend I believe our companies need to deliver a public good socially environmentally culturally and economically and one of the things I do not think it's important we should not be micromanaging our companies yes but what we need to do is ensure same pathway that we're traveling and that is what the leader of expectation does and that is why it's extremely important and there's opportunities throughout the term throughout the year where we have formal reviews and we need to use them them wisely I happily support where we're at I believe we can do better as a big step up from where we've been and I think it's good having this public public debate so thank you kiara thank you and I just hope that if the holdings company is traveling in the same direction as us traveling at least in an ev or possibly on bikes so with that I will put the motion all those in favor and the motion is as we see it above me yes um so for number one uh I put the motion all those in favor say aye aye would you like that noted um council

Uh christchurch city holdings limited draft letter of expectations 2021 to 2022. um because I'm a director of cchl I'm going to have to vacate the chair and because the deputy mayor is also a director of cchl he cannot assume the chair so I will call on the meeting to nominate someone to chair the meeting for item 12. I'd like to nominate james daniels um is there a seconder for that uh mike davidson aaron no offense to james I was gonna um nominate yani because he's been here for 50 years right for jones to do I just had a procedural question well yeah um but do you want to nominate jani as well not if he's backing james I'll back james thing okay great thank you uh yanni I was just going to check now that um we're not going into public excluded is it possible to make the report available to the public yes there was some last minute changes made to it um this morning it was only published this morning after our workshop on tuesday morning and so uh it hadn't and there were a couple of changes that that needed to be made to it uh I think that a couple of the workshop uh recommendations hadn't quite been picked up in the language so that's been fixed up as I understand it so it should be ready for publication now it will be in just a few moments so it will be it will be online um but counselors will have it on the hub they're trying to get it online electronically can't just do more than one thing at a time so um if you could get someone who could get a couple of hard copies from just take a few minutes it will just take a few moments because there isn't a printer in the chamber so we will get we'll get to that um as soon as possible but um if we slowly take our way through to voting in a chair then that will assist the process of getting the documentation in the public arena as quickly as possible so um I item 12 um has been moved and seconded are there any other nominations I will therefore put the motion that james daniels take the chair for item 12. all those in favor say aye those opponents say no that's carrie thank you and the cchl directors will step back from the table and not participate in the item I'll tell you uh kyoto tato if I had known I was going to be in this position I'd have worn um my rugby club jersey to represent shirley rugby club however um however look it's um something I've just assumed this role I've just assumed so I asked call on my colleagues to assist me through me and us through this very important paper we were considering this morning so I welcome to the the table linda gibb um performance monitoring advisor from city council diane brandish the acting general manager of finance and commercial and ian thompson our general counsel for for uh city council and ask you to take us through this paper this report the first thing I would like to start loe it is an administrative tool used to convey shareholders high-level key strategic expectations of the company or in the case of the letter to cchl to cchl who then will will transmit expectations through to each of the companies in the group on receipt of an loe the board will consider the content and it will taking into account its own obligations under the company's act to act and the best interest of the company will either will do one of two things it will either agree and action those expectations or eric we would expect them to come back to us and to want to discuss with you any of the expectations that it cannot it will that it feels it cannot progress the content of the loe should where it's agreed by the company then be reflected in the statement of intent but it's important to note that the letter of expectation is a high level strategic document there is some content that may not be appropriate for the level of an soi which is also high level um but it should be the why we issue an loe before in this case cchl group works through its business plans so that that all comes together into the soi when we get the soi it's a draft and it's due it's a statutory obligation due on the 1st of march and we review the soi to understand the extent to which the expectations have been reflected in there will staff advise you of any omissions there'll be engagement on that and then the final soi will reflect comments made and engagement had that covers the purpose and the process um in developing letters of expectation we have generally um engaged well we've had them actually we've had the experience over a course of a year to see where counsellors are what their issues are is they're raised from time to time in regular briefings that cchl provides we've generally we would hold a workshop we didn't this year because of the delays um and well the encumbrance of the covert 19 lockdown followed by the pressures that came up after that we focused the loe they wanted strength that you wanted strengthening of the climate change and governance provisions of the alloy and the spinal load or final draft aloe reflects those conversations okay so it's fair to say given that this is now in public um and it wasn't expected to be so the anyone who's watching and here attending doesn't have much in the way of documentation at this stage is that am I correct so in other words the draft loe that we've got is not widely available in this chamber is that correct that's correct that is correct chair we're just about to have five copies handed out so we're going to need to um we will do that but of course people who are participating by being here will not be able to to see what we're talking about nevertheless I think it's important that we we get on with it because as you've already indicated we're we've got a time pressure and that we're behind do I get that right we're behind time now of expectation and the uh statement of intent is due back from chcchl on the first of march the draft version yes yes we have offered because we are now running about a month behind or thereabouts we have offered that if they need it we can give them a one month extension that's provided for in the local government act that's fine okay so do I have any questions from the around the chamber yani thank you um thank you for your description at the start the explanation I was just wondering if you've considered using a statement of expectation which I understand as a tool that we can use that can set out in some detail some quite clear outcomes that we would like from our ccos and cchl and why we haven't used that mechanism the statement of expectations is a new tool added to the governance toolbox by the in the lga amendments of 2019 um the letter of expectation has been a long held tool that is commonly understood by both the crown and local government and in reading the statement to offer anything other than some legal status that we weren't able to get through the loe so we've continued to issue an loe I think the auckland council review uh auckland cco review indicated that the statement of expectation hasn't been used at all either by auckland council or anybody else and I think that's its conclusion was for the same reasons that the loe gets you where you need to be so I agree with linda's comments right so just so I'm clear there's nothing stopping us from doing a statement of expectation if we resolve to do it we could and it could do more than a letter of expectation which isn't the letter expectation isn't a mandatory requirement no it's not but historically it's been a kind of direction um to our cco cchl as to what we would expect in the statement of intent the statement of expectations in the act is a much more broad it takes a much more broad approach talks about relationships with um maori and and with the the preparing as I said are a little more focused on what they would like to see in the statement of intent but having sorry about having said that there is no reason why the loe could not include anything that is in the statement that that might be included in the statement of expectations it doesn't actually provide for us to do any more than we could otherwise because the letter of expectation is an administrative tool and its content is discretionary right um can I just check in terms of the amended letter of expectation there's a number of changes that have been made since the workshop um and I think we heard earlier today this morning that some things have been removed in particular for example um asking cchl to continue monitoring around our request around executive remuneration and I wasn't quite I wasn't quite sure um when that you know how that why that decision was made to to amend it so is someone just able to kind of go through how the amendments have been made um yes I can talk to to to make the document less detailed and more of a high level strategic document that sentence was actually omitted in error and has been put back in this morning so sorry just I've put the question through ahead of the meeting yesterday morning in the draft letter that we had at the workshop it said that we would continue to request cchl to report on our expectations of executive remuneration I haven't had any copies of those reports are they available are they still going to continue um and you know I heard that we'd change the letter to take that out because they weren't doing that so just was trying to understand that so the actual reporting that cchl does is not a report it's a verbal um report I guess on uh what they have been able to do in that regard it comes up usually every quarterly report and they talk to that issue so what's our sense of how well they've been responding to what we've put in the letter of expectation in the statement of intent of that issue is that the boards of the entities are the ones that are responsible for setting remuneration and that there are a lot of trade-offs that they take into account when they're looking for their executives cchl has continuously advised that they have been very strong on their advice to their subsidiary boards about exercising restraint they've also been quite clear that there is very little more they can do in that regard okay to reinforce the issue counselor johansson that statement in terms of expecting cchl to continue to pursue that matter is in the letter of expectation the concern if I just raise the concern the concern is we've repeatedly put that in and we don't know how that's being achieved and you know that's why I thought the ongoing monitoring was quite important and maybe we need to ask for an increase in the reporting around some of the things but I've sent cancer as a copy of a proposed amendment to address some of the remuneration thing through the statement of expectation requests so I'll just in version two that has now been circulated in the chamber that sentence or that issue of remuneration expectations has been as linda said has been restored to the letter and we're asking that cchl briefs us on specific issues including that so we will ask them for updates through the year it's not specific as to how many or how few reports they make to us okay um just the final question I have was in regards to the terrorist airport proposal I think what we're hearing from a community is that they really want the ability for council to provide some direction on that issue and I appreciate it's in the early stage but um what could we put in the letter of expectation that would set out clearly to cchl that we would expect that it there's a clear decision-making framework that highlights where the community and elected members who are the major shareholder of the airport and also the full shareholder of cshl have input the revised draft was strengthened following the briefing the other day and actually now says that and with their subsidiary companies to ensure an effective and aligned approach to climate change so it recognises the work they've been done and requests a closer working together now remember this is a strategic document it's not a list of tasks so that this change we feel encompasses what cchl and the airport are working on the question really is can we have something very specific about the terrorist airport proposal that sets out a clear expectation of how of the community and elected members been clear about who's making decisions and when and what the opportunity is for strategic direction input okay I'd ask um ian thompson as the general counsel to comment on that um firstly my I support what um dyer said that this is a strategic document and um it's not going to get down into the detail the sort of detail that you're looking for the other aspect to me also is that by making an amendment like that the council does not really have sufficient information in front of it to um to make that decision or about um going down that track I think what we've got in the document we've made it clear cchl know what we're talking about and it's just a instruction to cchl that they continue to work with us give us information as we want it I mean that's that's the whole point of these sort of documents to maintain the contact and I think what's um in there is perfectly fine and I want to remind councillors that we had a briefing and a type of workshop the other day where we did discuss these matters and as the general counsel says this this is a high level strategic letter of expectations yeah okay any other questions are you finished johnny yeah I'll save the rest for for debate um just I mean I've circulated the amendments to you I'll send them to the sectarian dorm as well um thank you melanie um I've got a number of amendments that I've forwarded around too but I presume that we'd do that during the debate section is that there's some let me find it uh it was under the governance um section and the very last um sentence there um and where it talks about being the remuneration being directly linked to performance so can you explain exactly what that means well I think it's saying just what it says um when we had the briefing the other day you'll recall that the chief executive did say that monitoring the subsidiaries is wider than just monitoring their salaries it's also about monitoring their performance and and how they're delivering across all the things they've been asked to do so monitoring salary alone would give you a very narrow perspective on what we have asked these subsidiaries to do in delivering council's strategic direction so this is talking about that wider view than just the very narrow view so one way of um reading that might be um that a bonus might be given um if there's good performance so that's the way I interpret that which is not necessarily something I support I do think it actually says that's sort of how it reads to me so when we get to debate I'd like that bit to be removed okay that's a question all right further questions from pauline just adding to what melanie's trying to do here I think rather than remove it you'd like the wording clarified so that it doesn't doesn't imply bonuses or automatic for performance with guys reading it in a converse manner to say that actually performance is valued um not just remuneration but the way this is written actually directly linked to performance actually does imply there could be bonuses so maybe it's just rather than deleting it it's just fixing the wording and if I can expand on that and excuse me use the chair for cutting across that's why we've added the words public sector organizations because public sector organizations and councils in particular do not get bonuses right we're not saying don't pay bonuses we're simply saying remember you're part of the public sector yeah sorry don't can you just repeat that what particular does not pay bonuses and it's part of a public sector ethos that you paid a salary to do and to deliver on your job but you don't get a bonus component now that and I'm sorry I may have misled you it doesn't apply necessarily to all public sectors but it certainly applies to this council and that's when we say and remember you're part of the public sector we're not saying don't pay a bonus we're saying be mindful that you are employed to deliver on your job and as you said I also interpret it both ways which is you know you were you were there to deliver to constantly show that you are delivering against the expectations so to be clear I thought you said that we don't pay bonuses in the cchl group no I'm saying we don't pay bonuses in council on council right yeah okay all right thank you paulie you finished jake um I'm not necessarily saying I have an opinion that we should be very prescriptive in to get a really clear opinion free answer is there anything stopping us legally to from being incredibly perspective prescriptive about what we would like to see from cchl ian um should really pretty much just be a yes or no well as much well yes that that that is an aspect but that the the point of these is to just um in a broad brushed way give a um an expectation to ccihl what we would like to see in the statement of intent yes you could specify something if you absolutely wanted to but the point I made in terms of council joe hansen's amendment was that you're going down a track and making a decision in a situation where you don't really have enough information to make a decision of that nature there is a there would be a lot of advice you would need to get as to whether or not I mean the the relationships that the point that um the chief executive made about the companies act the obligations of both cchl and the council the separation of their duties just well that's important and and if you're going to talk about good process here I don't think you're in a position to make that kind of call on the level of information that you have without making further inquiries and getting further advice now that is my view I just simply don't think you're in the right position and you are in breach of your obligations under the aid and you and I have had that discussion before um you in breach of your obligations under the act if you would make it to a decision in those circumstances right are there any more questions are you clear okay jimmy regarding the process I mean uh based on this uh the nato expectation as a strategic document we approve today and release to the cchl and I i would like to know uh uh if all those issues are chl know if you know some item need to be clarified you know more detailedly what is a process feedback to us before they present the hoi to the console because it's high-level sorry I mean that because this highly was strategic documents for those later or expectations am I right we cover so many uh big items like recovery copyrighting recovery prosperous economy and also progress report reporting etc I mean if the interpretation has misunderstood how to fill a gap then they can feedback to the council regarding to the practical soi so what is what is the question just clearly state the question question is interpretation all those high level strategies if the cchl have a misunderstanding well remembering that the letter of expectation sets out obviously our expectations at a high level then there is no we need to release tonight yes the soi statement of intent is how they address our expectations where do you see the gap if you don't mind jimmy what jimmy's saying is that a lot of the statements are very very broad and various counsellors have little more detailed bits but they're not really covered in it and I think that's pretty much what jimmy's saying yeah well I would have thought that when we were discussing this is a high level strategic document that we're that we're considering right now and then we'll hear more detail back from the company through the statement of intent but that's the point that jimmy and jake are raising is it does it strictly have to just be that or can there be more detail I think is where it's going I think the answer from ian was fairly clear can you repeat please I come back to the point that if you're wanting to add in reference to something like the terrorist development you're not in a position to actually make that that call make that decision um can I in in terms of the different levels we've got provisions ahead in here around climate change and that was the point being made by eco's extinction rebellion sorry um and and we've directed particular comments to the issue of climate change and we would expect um cchl to reflect that in their statement of intent so and I think that's at the the right level the right pitch in so much opinion um I'm not talking about tariffs at all I'm talking about salaries and and how in the future over not this year but in subsequent years if we wanted to be quite prescriptive on certain points can you as staff is there anything stopping the leader from being prescriptive if we want it to be maybe not now not today in future on certain subjects if we want it to be and can you help us do that in the future I'm sorry I thought you were yeah that's right um in terms of remuneration just to answer that point um councillor joe hanson mentioned clause 36a of schedule 7 of the act which entitles the council to adopt a remuneration policy but only for its employees not for a cco so the cco is separate from that and you know it would go against the usual division of responsibilities and duties if the the council was to be prescriptive about something that it's actually cco's responsibility to deal with and yes again we've gotten the letter of expectations the you you you wouldn't want to step over the line and interfere with the management of the company by saying anything more specific well you're asking them to deliver stuff you have to trust the board to know that they've got the right people there to deliver what we're asking them to deliver so if you sit if you restrict in one area then I think you are agree with me and you are cutting across the role of a council and the role of cco gel yeah I just want to remind all councillors that and it's been stated before that the companies are governed by the companies act which is to uh act in the best interests of the company doesn't even say of the shareholder right and so bear that in mind but the other thing is that the um regarding remuneration as um ian pointed out under sections 36a schedule 7 of the act it limits it that policy to council itself not the company so can we clear that can we clarify can we um understand that yeah that and so you've got elected members representing the public and the public feedback to us staff one of them is and it's in here climate change so the public a percentage of the public have come to us and said we want you to do more about it we've put it in our level of expectations so the expectation is those companies will and there's some quite clear targets in here and the point that um jake's raising is around renumeration because we have people from the public come to us and say why is the gap so big between the top end and the bottom end at the companies you own and if you uh and if we were trying to set a reasonable level of expectation we would be saying that gap needs to narrow we don't say that in here we don't say over the coming years we want to see that get narrow ben and jerry's for instance had a five times rule the ce couldn't be paid five times more than the lowest paid person so hang on is that a question um it is a question is well it started with a semi statement I learned well from councillor daniels the um the uh that we've done it in one section here but in the one that gets raised a lot by councillors joe hansen and um and now by uh mclennan that that they uh that that one isn't addressed and we're being told that it can't be but it's only a level of expectation that and it would be simple just to say that that gap narrows just like we have with um emissions we've said that's got to narrow that has to change can we not do the same with salary is the question one of the requirements or obligations on a cco in the act is to be a good employer so you would expect the cco to conduct itself in a way that it is a good employer and looks after its employees but I'd come back to the point that that is a matter for the company to determine as to than the council imposing um rules on them but we did it for climate change it's it's not as particular in climate change we're asking them to um yeah we have serious targets in climate change which will set as a council and then as a council we don't have to get to have uh serious targets around the wealth gap in this country and as a public employer we should we should be saying we're on questions and the chief executive has a comment to make I just want to in particular around pay restraints there are two points made in the letter of expectation that are explicit okay the first is we always as always we expect cchl group to exercise restraint in the level of senior executive total renew renewation and there's a little bit more uh taking into consideration the into account the public service nature of the positions and you in your deliberations through the last year have actually seen that take effect in certain board appointments in particular at the end of that paragraph it continues to clearly sector organizations and be directly linked to performance that's probably the strongest you've had it in your letter of expectation over many many years madam c that doesn't address the gap though and that's the problem in this country in the last 20 years as the gap has just really started spreading yes the bottom end has come up definitely I'll acknowledge that but the top end has moved a lot more than the bottom we're moving like that as a country the pay difference between a policeman being generous and an mp many these generals have that much to say about it but I'll leave that for debate any more questions questions only yanni the really hub of the question is for the last I don't know a few years five maybe a little bit longer ten um we've put the similar wording and about seniors executive remuneration and it hasn't actually achieved very much restraint at all and I can go through and quite you the increases um which have been very significant and actually a lot of of the question sorry outside sometimes of the circumstance of that individual employee so the question is is just repeating the same thing that we've always repeated going to achieve what we want and why do we have confidence that putting this in will actually lead to an improvement when we haven't seen that in the past who's that question directly to the people because I'll answer it if you want put it on behalf of the you know the meeting is there anything I'll answer it then that was right yes yes there is it's for us to be vigilant regarding this uh eloy and then the statement of intent it's it's our responsibility to keep knocking on that door we don't just let them run off and do what they want they come back to us and report to us so it's up to us to call them out on it with respect some of us have been doing that for at least 10 years and we've what we've seen is completely the opposite to what the chair that this is a new year it's a new set of people from 18 months ago and so it's up to us to do something about it in the first instance and then you have the ultimate remedy and that is if the board doesn't doesn't report what we want to hear or doesn't um doesn't meet our performance expectations that's when we're in a place to be in a position to be able to make changes there okay so ultimately the responsibility lies here are there any more questions because then we'll get to debate eventually okay right there being no more questions I understand that there are some people that want to make excuse me amendments to version two of the letter of expectations uh can can you indicate can you any of you indicate who wants to make both amendments right so I've got mike yani and melanie all right and aaron okay and aaron okay um can we I want to excuse me I want to go through those amendments of proposed amendments before please okay can we can you go through that again please so is it in paragraph 1. said joe but I'm happy having said moving amendment to actually put that into the version and then move that so they're in uh just one moment so I'm going to ask the meeting to consider whether we address each of these amendments individually or that we put all the amendments on the table and adopt them as a whole well this one's easily too easy to address individually it might be quite a good one just to get through the other ones without seeing them I don't know I would suggest individuals okay we're gonna we'll do them individually so as as I offered I was happy to actually put that into the version and then move the whole version so therefore it's on the table yeah yeah and if there's something to second answer so I've moved that yeah on the hall so on the whole of that one addition to it yeah okay and that moved mike yeah davidson's any debate sorry I can't hear yes okay I'm sorry motion on the table so the meeting is in debate I'm using the rules of debate um there is the opportunity for members to speak speak once move an amendment and have them second up but there's that one opportunity so now there's emotion on the table the appropriate way to deal with it would be to go into debate people to move their further amendments point of order because we understood that we would all get a chance to make several amendments if we had them before we went into debate which is what james said before sorry the other option that the council could consider is discussion with members who have amendments raising them and agree to informally put them in an updated version of the letter and then move to debate on that version of the letter in that instance um we've councillor davidson has moved and seconded that um or councillor cotter seconded you could with the agreement of the meeting withdraw that and the meeting could consider just continue then in due course somebody move the letter and then actually debate the points that have been added to it we still need to do the changes individually but you could you could do more than one vote as the movie can we just have a look at the amendments and maybe just to include them straight into the um can we just have a look at what the amendment's proposed amendments are going to be if we're happy with them we can just include them straight into this motion so I suggest we just adjourn for a couple of minutes yeah yeah we will adjourn for uh uh ten minutes actually while we uh take some make a decision here on where we go from here okay thanks right there and we restart the meeting the adjourned meeting look thank you for your patience in this matter it's been quite complicated uh before I go any further tim being on zoom did you have a comment we can't hear you sorry at the moment did you yeah here we go yeah I'm I'm we've just what I've decided we'll do is we'll resolve where we our way forward in the next hour and a half in other words I'm calling a lunch break now and when we come back I expect that we will have a document that we can consider in its entirety including all of the amendments that various members are wanting to make okay and we'll consider it in one fell swoop from 22 2 onwards all right so we're attuned for lunch thank you see you then live stream back up please thanks right I'm vacating the chair for the moment so somebody should have asked me before they adjourn the meeting so um you're doing a really good job though you are doing a great job james I'm okay I'm actually I'm actually enjoying observing from a distance thank you my coffee's gone cold okay can you let me know when we're back on live stream wow all good to go thank you very much look um I'm resumed the chair so that one item that was um that was debated really at the last time when we dealt with this motion so it was moved by myself it was seconded by councillor daniels and uh and so I'll ask that council daniels again second it so I will put that motion all those in favor say I those opposed say no that's carried thank you very much all right so we're in px now we'll clear the room and we'll continue with the other items on the agenda I promise that this
Uh the next item is the innovation innovating street cycle connection project ferry road sanassa street fitzgerald ave um we've just asked staff to give a little bit of context to the background to this paper obviously the innovating streets project is an enabler but there is more purpose that sits in behind that thank you absolutely thank you um kyota councillors and I'm claire piper I'm the project coordinator for innovating streets for the christchurch city council innovating streets is a program and funding opportunity through waka kotahi where we've received 90 funding for some of the for all of these projects that we've got before us today this is the first of about five projects that council is um running and the whole concept around innovating streets is to try and test uh new ways of doing things in a very lighter quicker cheaper way of uh the methodology but also using a placemaking approach where we interact um very more so um in consultation and co-design with the community at the heart of all of our projects and hopefully we have a context for this project sits within the wider context of our cycleways that we have in christchurch so we have um to the left the saness of street separated cycleway that's been completed and to the right the his kid express cycleway it's a major cycle route that's a separated cycle way as well what we're looking at is the green part in the middle that's our cycle connection project so currently the cycle lane is in the road and it's a bit of a missing connection there between the two cycleways for the city so what we're aiming to do today is for the council to approve uh the the resolutions that enable the safe and successful implementation of this trial that will see some changes in the road reserve area thank you um are there any questions for staff on this melanie and then yani um just looking at the map and this is quite detailed so look so there's a two-way cycle way along one half of it and then it sort of splits up and then becomes a that correct that's correct yep so how challenging will it be for cyclists who are going whichever way it is then they have to cross the road to get onto the other it won't be difficult so we've been down to site quite a few times in the peak hours and off peak hours to see how the road actually functions and because we've got those traffic lights at fitzgerald and at barbados street they're creating big gaps in the traffic flow so there's most cyclists won't have to wait and if they do have to wait it'll only be for a few seconds before they can safely cross the road okay cool yanny thank you I just said two questions um under 6.8 on page 162 the accessibility considerations it said the project team has met with include feedback in the design from accessibility group representatives I mean it goes on to list them is there anything that they raised that we haven't changed in the design that we haven't changed no we did um one of the proposals painting on the active road carriageway as a result of consultation with them and with the ncta safety team we've removed it right so and it's got a lot a lot of it has to do with um color low vision those with disabilities and dementia that might be using this area so we've removed it for the time being and we've retained the shoulder road painting as part of adding immunity to the area okay great and then I just like I know it was mentioned in here somewhere but I just struggling to find it sorry um there is talk of a safety audit so just to be clear we've done a safety audit of the design the pre-construction audit and we'll do a post construction order correct um are we able to get circulated that safety order that we've we've done and we don't usually circulate them um so the safe toilet process is quite complex not necessarily on this one this one's quite straightforward right but we we as far as them where we've never I guess of what happened previously with this intersection so nasa straight fury road also mindful of where we've had council staff come back around some of our cycleways with urgent safety recommendations post construction so I just think it's I mean I just think it'd be really good to get some sense of what the safety concerns are yes and then once it's done then we can we can address it what we'd usually do is we'd usually do a scheme stage safety audit so that's at concept level we'll do a detailed design stage safety audit and then we'll do a post-construction stage now this project's slightly different because it's in theory it's mostly temporary so if there's any issues we can just go in and change it in a couple of days so what we've done instead is we've done a combined scheme stage and detailed design stage safety audit right we've agreed with every single order to recommendation on them we made substantial changes to our plans and then we post-construction stage safety audit and then if there's any issues that come up we can change it sort of until three days and we'll look we can change them under tmp yeah and then we can come back and ask for resolutions afterwards that's great so we could just get that circulated though but I can't see any reason why we couldn't get that circulated implementation um yeah I mean we generally don't just because there's a context about it um uh and look we're happy to to action the the items that get raised it's just so we can have a like as a local elected rep it's just so we can have an awareness of what some of the concerns are so if we get feedback from the community we're better informed I mean I mean I support this project and I really commend you for all the work you've done in the engagement um but I just given some of the track record on some of these things and what we've seen I just safety concerns have been raised are and would it be helpful to get a briefing for the community board so that I mean if if there is concern about documentation that is without context in an isolation and a technical report might be better to have arranged for the people that wrote it to come and give a briefing to the community board that sounds excellent um because as part of that process we've got a very uh intensive monitoring and evaluation program wrapped around this project and around all of our innovating streets projects this seeks us having different methods of waves that the users of that area can feed back to us so they've got my direct contact details for example and we've got a web page and that will go on have your say as well so we'll be seeking feedback via that way as well as developing a new gis online tool that can drop a pin at a location people can comment on that yeah I don't I don't doubt what you're saying pulling that feedback and then its completion uh and then a second week and then every fortnight and then dropping down to every month that will occur for the duration of the entire project so however long this project is in place we will be having active monitoring and evaluation of the project itself and as bill has said what we can do is we can if the planters are in the wrong place because someone needs access to their driveway we'll go out and move them straight away and if there's any issues that have been raised we're going to address them straight away yeah but what I heard stuff say is you've done a safety order yes and you've agreed with everything that's in it and I would have thought just providing a sort of the chart with you know just the table of here's what the safety audit recommended here's what we've done that but I can't see why we need a briefing on that but well I I'm happy to have the bridge because the community board had a briefing and this was what was raised um and you know I mean I go into history but we're still waiting to get the safety brief the post-construction safety briefing on the one of the mcrs through the sheldon street come the terrace area then that's been over a year and it came to council was urgent and we still had no briefing on it so I mean I just can't see the harm in circulating what the safety concerns were identified and how they've been addressed if it's possible but happy for the board to get a briefing I just thought it would have been a simple piece of information that we could have had circulated can we take it under advisement I mean I i mean I I'm I'm hearing two things I wasn't aware that this was an issue so um sometimes it can be helpful to to know in advance of a meeting that people have a concern and then I can arrange for people to have to come brief with the response but look I mean I i this is going to be subject to an ongoing basis this is although it's part of a wider network approach to major cycleway routes it is also utilizing an innovative streets project funding mechanism to to to give it a go in a different way uh which is to be commended so thank you um sorry if I've got several sorry could I just answer something about the safety or I think just um the safety always go through a process and um auditors raise their concerns and then the designers review those and look at those in the context of the overall design so it's not necessarily every item that's raised by safety orders gets actioned because it may not necessarily need to be so um and there's a whole process that we work through so that's that's why I guess there's a hesitancy yeah it might be better just to do um to put so do you work together with the auditors to to to essentially so they do an initial sort of kind of evaluation from their perspective and terms of process the auditor will make a recommendation and then as the designer I will respond either accepting or disagreeing or proposing an alternate solution and then that'll go back to them for them to comment on and then it'll go to our safety engineer and then it will go to our client who's usually the project manager so it does go through an intuitive process I suppose to make sure everyone's in agreement if there is disagreement it will go to our transport steering group as well which is made up of people such as stefan and lynette to get approval for the disagreement right so is there um is were there any um outstanding areas of concern as a result of that process not on this one though no not in this one okay so I'm I'm comfortable that we just leave it where it is um uh just with a a a brief note to counselors just with an update of that process all right um so I've got um sarah aaron pauline and mike that's good a that your question has been asked and answered and we will be um coming back to the community with the results of that monitoring as well I'll be giving feedback as I write down it excellent wonderful aaron um dear two quick questions um one is a follow-up from um councillor coca's question around that where that crossing point in the middle so we've got one of those on the uh up the top end of colombo street uh I've used it maybe 30 times myself never seen any incidents but has there been any incidents there seems to work but has there been any that one I don't believe so but I'd have to double check I know that there has been they've had some difficulties with some other ones this is a very different road this is very quiet it's similar to similar to columbus street but when I've used him on columbus street I've noticed cyclists aren't necessarily waiting for the lights before I know so we've taken that on board when we've designed same designers but it was a major cycle team who did not audit so they're well aware of how those crossings work and they're the ones who recommended this treatment originally we're going to have cars giving way to cycles right but they suggested we make it cycles give way because they're not going to have to for most of the time brilliant okay well answered and the other one is the um the ski ramp for mice that you brought in wonderful what is you brought it in yes and then not said anything about it no um thanks so as some of these projects people ask me where's the innovation where's the interesting elements so you'll see on the plans there's wonderful colors that are going to be edited in and some of you that have been around post quake you would have seen some of the street um painting that the road painting that um the urban regeneration team did in the city at that time so that's part of the innovation is adding color and vibrancy back along the way we've looked at different materials and how they can be innovative so using things in a different way in a more creative way what we have in front of you is a wave delineator its um primary purpose and design is as a cycle uh separator in this situation we're not we're using it somewhat as a cycle separator but along the painted um the painted sections what we didn't want is people to drive on those painted sections so there's some planters there but there's nothing really stopping anyone from you know curving in and parking in there so we've got these from america we're very lucky we did the order in time so we've got them at our fingertips and I can say that we will be the first council in new zealand to implement this product uh auckland transport are trying really hard um I think the container is delayed so that's a shame and so we will be the first so that's the innovation is using a an existing product in a to the design also another innovation um that we're using is on the bus platform um at the arda one way section um you'll see there's some kind of pebbly style um dots on the plan they are called led limbo seats and if you want to google them feel free the only time they've ever been seen is at vivid sydney so we will be the first in new zealand to have those um pebble led seats they will be lit at night the idea here is to create an interesting instagramable moment around pt to encourage people that that's a really cool spot to be um and so we're looking forward to having those and they are in new zealand as well so we're very blessed that we haven't had the same delays as other councils with um getting materials and assets uh to deliver these innovating streets projects thank you well well spotted aaron I hadn't noticed it uh pauline and mike yeah well actually funnily enough that was going to be my question too to ask you aspects of it which you've pretty much done I think you've covered everything so the other things would be I guess the colorful paint is different and um so you've got the cycle lane and the green and then the colorful paint what does that do on the outside of that the colourful paint is is basically the leftover space for example as we're narrowing the road carriageway as a result of needing to keep the speeds down so you'll see that one of the key moves and the resolutions you'll be supporting today is the the speed limit reduction from 50ks to 30k yeah so some of that relates to how the design of the street is done and so what we've got is we've got this shoulder so we've decided to give it a bit of vibrancy in that area using paint it's a anti-slip paint yeah so it's really good um and our team are really excited to get it on the road and add colour to that area great and so I think that what this funky fun stuff going on here now that people will just naturally slow down that's great we hope it looks awesome and we need to add to that so the the innovating streets concept is that you design like a normal road design and then you bring it back and you make a temporary one so those painted areas in the sort of the traditional design would actually be landscaping so it'll be either berms and trees or rain gardens and stuff like that so that's really one of the things we're testing is if we do we need that space and if we if we do what we don't need if we need it as a separator so in the final design that would hopefully be planted up like durham street or could it be remain as funky painting it could you just got an ongoing maintenance costed actually you have to have to repaint it quite frequently oh I see it'd be sort of every two years or so you'd have to be paying it but yes yes you could colorful roads are quite interesting and I think they do have a good effect on slowing people down so it'll be interesting to watch this project thank you good mike thank you just a couple of quick questions um on the design um I just noticed on ferry road at the barbados intersection heading west you've got a stop box there which is in line with the left turning lane well shouldn't that be an advanced one just in front of it just to give it little more visibility for people on cars of cycle you may move further towards the um pedestrian crossing area oh that one um yeah we can move that slightly further forward yeah thank you uh the the other thing the exit of williams street um being a good way out and going into a um I guess a bi-directional cycle way which is the concern obviously with bi-directional ones are you happy with the foot being a good one instead of a stop to actually make people stop and yeah there's really good visibility there when we can change it guess it's just the the habit I guess of of people when they're to I guess coast through a good way just looking in in the one direction not expecting um a cyclist becoming and and that would also get used by quite a few people during school term and I'm just wondering if potentially just to get people in the habit of stopping to look and check both directions yep okay thank you um so that's oh phil major thank you guys just a couple of questions that it's probably in here and I haven't seen it that how much is the total cost I know we're getting 90 but what's the total number the total cost of delivering the entire project roughly 750 750 okay now just some on the right track that all the build outs and stuff like that they're all a temporary things and that there's no curb and channels being shifted it's all there's there's some kerbin channel at the bus stops outside armor because we have to have a certain to get on um that is it though the rest of it oh and it has to take some of the kerbs out at the intersection with saint massive streaks it it's been built for a one-way cycle and we need to be bi-directional but we're just going to knock them off so it's only because only miner changed things um and did the locals down there know that they might be going to lose about half their cup up so they are aware of that okay and roughly how long is it in for as long as we like or until the permanent scan comes through yes okay thank you james kiana um hey look I share mike's um concerns about the giveaway sign at williams street go exiting on to um ferry road I wasn't clear on what was going to happen about that oh is it that easy oh can I have one on my street um no the next thing is next thing is this uh thingy there is is that a set I missed the point I think is that yeah you know I i know we're talking about in innovation and so on but I do worry about those things because and I'm very supportive of cycles I've got to say I put that on the table but you know the bollards that are in some places around town I think some people enjoy driving over them and wrecking them how's that going to stand up we brought it here so that you can have a have a tactile moment with it if you like we have had um our traffic uh operations and engineers have a really good play with it including two people trying to go all the way along to see if it'll break it hasn't uh and you know we've we're quite active uh checking to see if it it works um we're quite happy and satisfied that it will work the thing about it is it's going to be dynabolder down into the road if it doesn't work we'll take it out yeah yeah you haven't seen council mage's latest but um yeah look the one other thing though is I notice and and I know that I see we've got some good points scoring in against auckland about this and that and so on but one thing I think they do do well with their cycle lanes I think they are um white ways at least is that they've got um quite thick these things are dyna bolted into the ground you'll have seen them I guess those little yellow ones are not bollards and they're really effective like on saint luke's road there I see that regularly so do we do that here yeah they are quite effective and you can use them I'd be a little bit concerned with the way children are crossing the road around the school that it could become a bit of a tripping hazard because they are so low and those kids just come out the gate and just sort of swarm across the road to the cars we've got these now so I'd suggest we use them but if these aren't working yeah okay well good luck thanks thank you are there any other questions there appear to be none who would like to move this jake and signa by sarah is there any debate while people are having a play thank you seems like a very strong product so I've got um it's um it's been moved and seconded by jake and sarah debate sarah just quickly thank you so much for all the work on this another board really excited when we saw the original design but gutted not to have the big um the 3d visual thing um on the road but that's the way that goes um I mean the focus has been I guess in the discussion so far on the innovation and the materials being used but actually for me the key innovation is in the process and we've been wanting for ages to be able to trial something before we put it in so people can experience it see what it's really like we can make tweaks and changes beforehand which is the key thing and the fact that this by both changing some of the guidelines and giving us funding has been really important ahead of now where do people pay for anything like this 100 and it's not as cheap as you might expect with temporary staff there's a whole pile of stuff goes into it um so that's going to make this um a real game changer I think for this area um there's a lot of people coming up um fury road now and heading to centesa street and I hear a lot of comments from people saying when's council going to do this but and I'm now able to say it's coming very very soon which is really good so thank you so much for your work and I know the school kids have been really engaged and interested and I look forward to seeing how it goes thanks thank you uh aaron yeah I'll start by agreeing with sarah pretty much a hundred percent um on this uh and it's has been a bit weird being down around there and seeing that gap of and then you've got some asif street along there so the two not connecting up so I agree there um and I will raise phil's point around the parking and the thing here is that again it's temporary so if the taking away the parking doesn't work and the businesses can come in and say hey look it hasn't worked for this reason or whoever it can be changed it can it can go back the rainbow roads I think that's something that's going to stick going back to pauline's point I think they will probably be more successful than we give them credit for um I think uh they'll be a point of interest they will slow people um and I think people really won't drive on them um it'll be out of respect for uh it appears like a piece of art so I'm impressed by all of that this here is kind of what I think we should have done with every single major cycleway in the city we should be do them all temporary uh and then change them around and work with our communities first to uh get the designs right and that's what's happened here the concept of the tactical urbanism I think is fantastic this I think it'll be proved here to be good I don't think this will be the final design I think there will be changes um but those changes uh will be like you say really really quick and if there are problems so this kind of is like doing a cycle way with the community rather than to the community and I think that'll have a better outcome for getting more people on bikes and this is exactly what our board had asked for for hillwood road thank you there any other comments I'll um put the motion all those in favor say aye all right those opposed no it's carried as part of this project as it's an exemplar for waka kotahi so we look forward to endure course in march when it's final completion to invite you to come along and join us excellent thank us know when of his availability this year yeah this year this year right
Opposition is noted thank you tim thank you um the next item on the agenda is the hearings panel report to the council on the draft community housing strategy it says 2020 to 2030 but I think we're going to hear that because we're in 2021 we're going to change the dates yes I'd like to hand over to councillor galloway who chaired the hearings panel thank you for that kiara and thank you it's my pleasure as chair of the hearings panel with support from my fellow panel members councillor mal koka and community board chair alexandra davids to report on the outcomes of the hearing process and the submissions received to the council for a decision on the final form and adoption of the draft community housing strategy 2021 to 2031. council is reviewing its existing social housing strategy from 2007 because council needs to identify the strategic roles and actions it can take to ensure sufficient social housing that is provided as provided in christchurch the proposal in this draft strategy is to reframe social housing as community housing linking and embedding stretch to rename the strategy as a community housing strategy the definition of community housing can be seen can be read in 0.3.3 of the report to genuinely achieve improvement in both quality and quantity of community and to achieve this the council needs to consider the current constraints of funding in the fund and the financing options the draft strategy was widely consulted on through media through community groups and many were engaged with the draft strategy was presented at several forums for housing providers and other stakeholders 23 submissions were received eight from organizations four from community boards 11 from individuals and six oral submissions were heard and those points that were made and those submissions came outlined in section six of the report there was strong very strong support for the strategy positive comments on its conception framework and direction were recorded one was an opposition and that did not and that person did not believe that council should be involved in any way in the provision of social housing as a result of what the panel heard and read and our subsequent deliberations changes were made the tracked changes attached to this document and the key issues that were addressed by the hearings panel can also be seen in section seven of the report so I'd like to express my thanks and gratitude to the enormous work that staff have done to present the strategy to us but also to the community groups and individuals who took the time and are passionate about the provision of community housing in our city and I would request that the council accept the recommendations of the hearings panel and adopts the housing strategy 2021-31 I'd like to invite staff to the table to answer any questions that counsellors may have thank you could I ask councillors if they got any questions jimmy chen thank you thank you staff and the hearing painter donald greater job who presented to us those comprehensive report but I have a two questions the first one with you regarding to the whether the hearing panel you know particular focus I'll draft the social community housing strategy consider those the other diversified community and because except the elderly and disabled you know any uh the 23 submission have any the from the uh different ethic of the uh cultural background make submission because because my particular concern some of the people they would like to build after the community of social housing they can grow together in a particular consider their way of life or there can easy to communication and support of one another I'm not sure whether you talk about this issue or not okay um thank you ms mia um I guess at two levels I mean firstly we canvassed as far and wide as we possibly could in terms of our general stakeholder community group interest group lists and so on and so forth so we sought to make them all aware of what we were doing certainly at the consultation stage and certainly at the engagement stage we worked uh quite heavily and quite closely with the community housing provider sector who are very representative and take into account um diverse needs um very strongly through the um community housing providers network so um and who several of those members submitted um on the strategy itself at a very strategic level a conceptual level we talk strongly about a housing adequacy approach to community housing and some of the key things around there are being culturally appropriate for example in terms of access to community housing so whilst we didn't specifically get perhaps one or two of the groups you were thinking about counselor chen we did make efforts and we have sought to um reflect um those notions through the strategy's thinking thank you second question yes please regarding the implementation plan thank you that's very good detail but I'm considered concerned particular focus on the action and the measurement this one properly we need to have some the uh supporting the funding to support for implementation but at least uh particular social company housing is a rates a new charity so I'm not sure where the funding comes from you know can support this implementation plan um those are challenges for council I mean the strategy attempts to lay out the challenges um front of council and chart a way forward in terms of a more broader thinking about community and we note in there that ultimately those are decisions for council through its long-term plan uh the strategy uh guest seeks in this section under our roles will need to consider its ability and willingness to resource that we know several actions and measures in the implementation plan about talking about a well-being assessment if council wants to invest within a urban regeneration sort of thinking um around social and economic impacts so I guess the strategy is um allowing council to do that if it so wishes so I guess that's a departure from some of the past thinking so if council wishes to invest more strongly then this this is just the strategy chart some direction for that could invite the chief executive just to say a few words on it thank you madame um councillor chen I think it's also important to realize you will need to have a proper policy debate now you have a clear policy at this time in terms of what you will and will not do in relation to housing and this strategy would need to be debated you will be looking at in this coming year not at this point in time because obviously we will be publishing the ltp in three weeks time the draft ltp and we've also um got a number of our partners you know well obviously um cchl but also ocht working very hard on what the different models are that could in fact enable um the um the the outcome but not impact on the rates um required from our ratepayers so which would be but that's a bigger piece of work and taking that will take quite some time to work through and that's outside the the the ltp process yeah thank you there any other questions would you like to move yes but before we do we need to add um a fourth uh recommendation because we need to amend the dates of the community no no is it done adopts the community sorry it's done helpfully titled 2021 to 2031. sorry I didn't didn't realize it so you would like to move that I would love to move it thank you and'll open it up for debate andrew thank you very much and I'd like to start by acknowledging the good work of the hearings panel um led by um chair and galloway community housing is an important aspect of council's work ensuring that there's fit for purpose warm dry housing for everyone that needs it so that housing is available affordably to those that need it most so I applaud the um focus on what we might broadly call the housing continuum so not only focusing on assisted rental housing but also on affordable home ownership and how an individual might make a transition um from community housing into affordable housing and then quite possibly into market housing paragraph 3.5 of the report sets out clearly really what the the big tension is here the ability to provide the quantity and the quality of community housing required and in fact affordable housing required at a time of increased need and covert has certainly played into that along with a number of other matters particularly related to the housing market but also at a time of of constrained legislative need to be upgrading the rental properties in terms of heating and ventilation arguably something that we should be doing anyway regardless of the the need from a legislative point of view so council definitely has a role to play in the provision of housing but again the point is well made in this piece of work that council cannot and arguably should not do that on its own it can do that best in partnership with others not only the otahi community housing trust but also with um partnerships with other housing providers across the city so this is certainly a good piece of work it's a big step in the right direction I welcome the discussion that councillor chen raised and the chief executive responded to around the the funding parameters for social housing that certainly will require us to have a look at the income projections from the head lease to the otahi community housing trust inevitably will involve some discussion about whether rates could correctly be used to support the um social housing portfolio on either a temporary or more permanent basis or whether are actually sufficient to deliver the quality and quantity required I welcome that discussion but for today I applaud this piece of work and I'm very very happy with the way it's been carried out thank you any others um jimmy chen thank you yeah yeah I support this uh the new device the uh the council the committee social housing strategy because we review the purewas one was uh published in 2007 so it has been for almost 14 years but over the last 14 years council and also city of culture we pursued so many disasters the earthquake one and paul hill the the bush the the fire and also the most attack in 2019 and also the the those koi knight in the pandemic you know that's quite quite a lot the the disasters and quite a few people even now you know the rental fees increase a lot and some people showed off this uh the housing to to stay you know for the accommodation so council take the lead to face these situations and integrate all those the key the housing provider there for this new revised strategy but also the for our implementation plan but we still need to face you know the real situation because a moment let's read the neutrality regarding to the policy we know we need to face this new situation how to break things through can provide sufficient resources funded to make these strategies more practical implementable yes we need to know how the time ago and also all the the the the lessons so when to face this year so I fully support this strategy thank you and gallery thank you I think we're all aware of the enormous challenges that we face in new zealand uh in terms of housing and we have in christchurch a waiting list of around 10 000 people waiting it's only going to get worse and our children and our grandchildren are going to be confronted by the housing issues that we have not had to to worry about so I hope that as a council we can think about the future we can think about the vision that's here that community housing is foundation of our well-being and to start putting out our minds to how we're going to address that challenge going forward and I look forward to understanding the work that the housing trust and cchl are doing around options for funding going forward because that is going to be the key how we're going to resource the need that we're going to have so um thank you again for the work that's been done we appreciate it our community appreciates it and I look forward to your support here thank you I'll um put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried abstention well we've noted the conflicts of interest so that there is no voting from either yani o hansen or film major as their members of the ocht board thank you thank you paul the next item is the
That's carried uh the next is the regulatory performance committee minutes from the second of december could I invite you councillor scandret from afar to uh perhaps give a quick presentation on the introduction of the minutes uh thank you uh and let's I'll take it as rita it's a standard that we do each year it's required requirement and I'll take any questions although I can't really see that there would be any but I'm more than happy to take some uh pauline oh thanks tim and welcome from afar um I've got a question about the discussion that you held about capacity within the animal management team to administer the dog control act section 10a policy and practices um what was the result of that discussion was it was obviously relating to resourcing did we end up that we do have enough resourcing or we don't have enough resourcing I think there is enough resources but but like the rest of the unit and when we mentioned um with regards to right across the board with um um are well and truly managing very well okay thank you and yani did you have a question on this one yeah I was just wanting to ensure that um prior to the 10th anniversary of the february earthquake that we do get that list of the earthquake prone priority buildings so I just wanted to um ensure that we could have that information yeah I'll just ask um staff leonie bray yeah yanny um yes so um uh yes we will have that list it will be provided it's very difficult to get the information of the nba website we download it so we upload it through a spreadsheet we don't hold the database mb control the database but we will have that list if you go to the nb website um you can actually um see a spatial view of where all the earthquake prone buildings are in christchurch but it doesn't filter down to the seven and a half or the fifteenth year but they will show you where they all are and all the addresses so there's a lot of information there on the fifth of february okay thank you that's great thank you um tim would you like to move up is he allowed to move from afar yes yes uh tim would you like to move the minutes be accepted yes I'll move that seconded by aaron I'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that's carried thank you thank you
And welcome to the last committee meeting for the year we're going to start the meeting with our karakia and um has volunteered to do that for us today so thank you kiara thank you very much we have um apologies from councillors chukoff and kuan today and the mayor is coming by a zoom in from home um any other apologies really departures do I have a mover for those sam seconder tim all in favor any against all right kerry thank you very much declarations of interest we've got a couple of small ones noted for the funding applications yep um so if any other ones pop up during the meeting just please let us know thank you very much confirmation of previous minutes to have a mover and secondary tim all in favor any against no that's carried thank you very much so now move on to the public forum section of the meeting and we have two of those today so ihorangi if you'd like to come forward to the desk there and if you switch your microphone on so it turns'll be aware that you've got five minutes to talk to us about your issue today thank you very much okay um the bus exchange opened in may 2015 with the at the cost of 53 million dollars um my issue today is around the youth that hang around in the exchange and their um violence and the yeah just yeah just the earth that hang around the exchange and basically the violence um the youth that hang around the business interchange all have some gang affiliation at the moment there are around 15 to 20 people that hang around the bus exchange and they're known as town bums um on wednesday the 9th of december I had my phone stolen from inside the bus exchange and this wouldn't have happened if the security guard didn't let the person in basically the the person has trespassed from both the exchange and the crossing um yeah um also I have heard through the um security guards at the exchange that the trespassers are going to be wiped um there is a guy on the trespass list who at the bus interchange and now they are allowed to have free reign basically if bus exchange you're allowed to go in and catch the buses um and they may may well do it to another girl or a security guard um um I have also been a witness to many fights at the exchange and this is not okay it's supposed to be a safe public place but at the moment I don't think it's safe for me and the staff and also other customers what I would like to see improve is more security guard and staff the trespassers to stay and either a youth worker or youth aid officer to be present at the bus exchange any questions thanks so much for that um so I've got questions here from jake and yani my question's actually not very good but those are fantastic suggestions do you said that the person that stole your phone was able to get into the bus exchange and and pass by security do you think there's also an increased role for perhaps better training and trespassed at any one point in time yeah definitely thank you yanny yeah thanks um thanks for the suggestion have you talked to council staff at all about the arrangements of security I made a complaint and how was that handled like what feedback did you get I haven't heard anything back right um and just do you think like I just was really interested in having a youth worker there but have do you have any thoughts on having a dedicated youth space like a a youth center in the bus exchange would that be something that you think have you considered having a more permanent space rather than just a youth worker and if so what was that that didn't come through my mind but yeah okay thank you um so tim then james at this time um you mentioned when you were talking that someone had been trespassed but then had free range of this the bus exchange could you um can a wee bit more on that sorry because if someone's trespassed then they should not be there for stop so so um do you do you know why they got wiped at all the cats are taking all trespassers all trespass people off the list well we can check up on that yeah I mean they do expire after a period of time so don't know yeah james apologies if uh you did mention this but uh when when I use the uh bus exchange there are security people there quite it's quite noticeable do you not see them I do but they yeah there's not they don't they're not active probably not active okay okay I'd agree with that to be honest to be frank I noticed that okay so I think thank you so much for coming and there's no more questions but what we are going to do is we're going to refer the issues that you've got onto staff and we're going to get some information back for councillors and back for you as well and ann might be able to share that with you and and we will see where we can go from there but I people like yourself involved in that conversation what to do as well okay so thanks so much for coming in okay so our next uh public forum is um dave idale and laurie shaw who are speaking on behalf of residents of vogel street regarding an ocht development so welcome and if you come up to the front now this was going to be multiple separate um presentations and we've done as we've combined them into one 10-minute public forum instead thank you very much for coming in thank you for having us thank you um so we have some slides to go up the one thing with the slides is when the slides are up you can't see the time at the same time yeah do you mind if I just grab my phone so I can use it that's fine because I don't want to overclock welcome good morning um so I guess a bit of background we've owned a house in vogel street since 2005. we rebuilt knowing that there was social housing behind us and that there was likely that we're not we're not against social housing we understand that there's a need for it and it needs to be somewhere um we were hoping with the design for the rebuild that it would be sympathetic to previous developments that had happened on the site so directly across the stream from garden place is another piece of social housing it's mixed use it's got two-story single-story it's built with permanent materials it looks really nice um unfortunately this is not the case sorry I'm a little bit nervous the proposed design is is really none of these things it is poor design it will lead to dark units it will lead to disputes within the tenants that will lead to us losing our sunlight and privacy there are 13 separate properties that back on to this development along vogel street so this isn't a small impact in terms of our local area sunlight and privacy would be the two key components that that that we're really concerned about in terms of what how this impacts um so I've lost size and the scale of the units they're simply not in keeping with what's already on site and I feel that there could be some solutions that would be easily easy to be kind of you know help with the design that they've put through I mean ideally we'd like to see a complete redesign that was more sympathetic to the area and also that would allow the units to have north-facing windows because currently they don't in the proposed design where I understand that this has now gone to the planning area and the likelihood of that happening is pretty low so from our perspective moving the units off the boundaries so that they're not so hard up against our boundary would would massively impact on our both our privacy and our sunlight um and we would also like to see a planting strip placed between between the boundary and the and the redevelopment so that we just we can help kind of increase the thing um the other thing is I'm I'm also really kind of disturbed by the way this process there were numerous inquiries made by multiple people to them over the periods that this was obvious to everyone that things were moving these were universally ignored we didn't hear back from them at all period so the only engagement that we got from them was once they had submitted the plans to council and that's not really community engagement at that point that's kind of just telling us what's going to happen which is I don't know basically taking notice out the paper and they've really used the the whole process around around the way that they've put the proposal together is a very much a box thing taking exercise like they've gone to the urban planners they've gone to the pre-planning meetings they've done a c-pit you know it's great that they've done all these these things but they've almost universally ignored all the recommendations from those from those things and they've just picked the ones that suit their design and then they'll tell us about how those are the most feel that it's you know there could have been a better way of doing this and for for an organization which is basically de facto council this is just not best practice it's not even a good practice and I think the design shows that I'll pass over to laurie now okay I am a hoenn omit in the long row of six units where the ocht plans to parallel their longest two-story block of ten units directly to our west significantly impinging on our privacy and sunlight in every single other units quote the ocht the orientation of the block means overlooking between units to each other's internal living spaces is able to be minimized however the largest block has been designed to look straight into the living areas and bedrooms of those of us across the fence and we will be looking straight back in their bedrooms to quote all outdoor living spaces will receive good levels of sunlight during the day however some of those yards will be in the shade of our building for much of the morning and their own building before 6 pm in the middle of summer the implications for wintertime when sunlight means so much to people like me with seasonal affective disorder is disturbing due to multiple health conditions I am home all day and in our yard our yard feeds us with its vegetables and fruits it's a second living and dining space it's a private sanctuary of greenery it's my evening sun and sanity plants and people don't thrive without good light our family would not have bought here 28 years ago if it lacked privacy or good light to garden those were prime considerations until recently we had no problem with social housing and are very much in favor of it problems arose in the neighborhood with the massive hnz block at the top of the street they finally hired a security guard I've heard that delta community support trust is overburdened no suburb should be so impositioned with such high intensity social housing when other residents have needs too and the growth of the city is happening elsewhere with the gallatin place flats one of my former neighbours the trust he was up front that he was straight out of prison and she was clear she wasn't interested in a relationship but he'd come drunk banging on her door in the middle of the night and tried to force his way in for the remainder of her time here she was terrified which entirely altered her life she was like many of the tenants in the set of units we live in a single mother with young children I would like to know for the safety of those in our units what is the proportion of men who will be living in this upstairs block and will they have in will they have criminal records like the one who harassed my neighbor what is the strategy when incidences like this arise given the bank of windows that will look straight into the bedrooms of women and children and into their yards and conversely what is their management strategy when they house vulnerable tenants whose own bedrooms face some of the current tenants and adjacent units to ours who have loud vulgar domestics which would echo back police getting multiple complaints have shown little interest in policing how do you justify this design where people are looking straight into each other's lives some on both sides may have quite troubling quite a troubling element to them ocht have argued to us that it could be worse but really it's in a similar league of bad design like the hnz building it's institutional not home like for supremely pissing off the neighbours for robbing sun and privacy they have managed to only gain seven more units and introduce some of the worst aspects of higher density building in a neighborhood that really doesn't need seven extra units of social housing nor to dismantle decades of goodwill I was at all in favor of rebuilding the council flats in better ways so it flummoxes me that anyone could come up with a design that would put neighbor against neighbour in a formerly harmonious relationship it doesn't serve its own tenants well in multiplying the number of shared walls and ceilings with each other and disrespecting both ours and their privacy and sunlight the trust needs not eroding vulnerable neighborhoods they should do better by everyone this is a mistake that will have many decades of repercussions it's worth getting it right for the whole community they could have been part of a force that helps maintain the special character of the neighborhood but choose to be a destructive force in the march of anonymizing developments that treat people as stackables who don't need light privacy or safety I implore them to radically change their design thank you are you speaking as well sorry oh no no no he's been running around okay so we do have uh 45 seconds if there's a single question um otherwise we have had a small amount of information through back from council staff and I'm wondering jake if you'd like to share that with them it's because your local councillor yeah and actually if you would be able to facilitate a meeting with kate or someone at ocht um so that so that the the residents can actually talk to ocht about their concerns um face to face is that all property is not so ocht do operate and manage some council loan facilities these ones are not um so these are actually owned and operated by um and the developments being done by ocet itself under their capacity so if jake if you're able to organize that and facilitate a meeting um and then maybe report back to it as council to see if there's anything that we need to be looking at that would be really useful okay thanks so much for coming in so when I looked around initially the first 10 seconds knocked for questions I didn't see your hand sorry yeah so I just yeah well if you're stepping back you're stepping back yeah do you think maybe you would like to go to the meeting with jake would that be really helpful no I mean I i did think in the information it may be appropriate that council and trust could talk through some of these planning issues but that's up for you guys yeah yeah but um there is a relationship between trust and council there is and and wasteford that you think that need to happen there that would be really good the ocht the trust does have very strong wrap around services for the units if that's of any help to you as well I think which will come out of the media doesn't solve the privacy issues no it doesn't it's so there's a broad range of issues there and I think that the best way to do that is to deal face to face and jake if you need help facilitating that doing that that's part of our complaint plus they also uh sublet a number of the units and the existing thing out to the salvation army which had different clients and different policies and different management strategies and that caused issues so we will yeah okay so thanks so much for coming in and raising those concerns with us today all right next we move um to deputations by appointment so deputations are different to public forum and that they relate to items actually already on the agenda and so the first of those today community facilities network plan so joanna you're aware that this is um you've got 10 minutes and it's about the the plan itself rather than any individual facility that you might like a decision on at some point good morning members thank you for the opportunity to speak to the community facilities network plan report I don't agree that there are no gaps in this plan I agree with other submitters that this plan does not seem thorough enough I don't agree that the process outlined in question 2 of the consultation is sufficient to address the residents needs yes community facilities should be community led but not all facilities should involve having a community partner community facilities are a service provided by council to serve the residents and their communities they are not for community partnerships with groups churches or trusts they are for the residents yes community needs must be demonstrated a feasibility study needs to be done by local council staff not consultants local council staff have intellectual property history of the area knowledge of the community and residents needs the feasibility interested residents as well as elected members I do agree that a business case should be done by local council staff and council's role needs to be well established I don't agree that community boards should solely make decisions on community facilities board members are lay people and elections are held every three years how are new board members able to make informed decisions on establishing or disestablishing a community facility I have a number of concerns firstly this plan doesn't take into account the increase in social housing and infill housing in certain suburbs secondly I am concerned that the changes to the district plan have not been considered thoroughly enough especially changes to residential living density zones thirdly it concerns me that developer contributions collected in my area are not being reinvested into community facilities in my area thank you for your time thanks so much join us there's time for questions melanie um regarding the comment about community boards who do you think should have the decision-making there I think it needs to be a combined effort for everybody involved that it shouldn staff have a lot of intellectual property they know the areas they are specialists in their um they've trained in those areas so um community board members as I said are just lay people they're not trained specifically to design community centres or understand urban development or the social issues um different communities so when you say everyone who do you mean exactly um council community boards stakeholders and residents it needs to be a combined effort okay thank you okay any other questions so joan at the moment we have a process um whereby if a facility was going to be established or disestablished or those kind of things there would be a proposal put together by those um expert staff that then would probably go out for a stakeholder and community consultation and that feedback would come in and then the community will make a decision does that help yeah I don't think enough emphasis is actually given to the residents um I think more consultation is done with um stakeholders rather than residents and as I said before the community facilities are actually a needs to be kind of redirected to what the community community um what the residents actually need rather than um who the stakeholder is who the community partnerships are because they're just doing a role um whereas it's there a service for residents yeah so one of the things we have heard is that there's some concern about that the emphasis on partnerships and trying to get as many partners as possible and that some communities won't have the capacity for that so we do have um some wording to soften that um for today okay that's great yeah and so that it talks about helping develop capacity in communities um and that you know we'd like to increase it but it's not to be all and end all yeah sounds good is that sounding right I'm interested in seeing um opportunities to empower residents like um it seems to be that the stakeholders get to say what activities and events and things happen in community facilities whereas with all the issues and social issues and social isolation I think it's from the bottom up to provide them with opportunities to say what do they want to do in their community facilities rather than having people tell them what they're going to provide for them in their community facilities thank you ann thank you thank you joanna and just further to that yeah how would how do you think that could happen what would be the best way to get that voice coming through would it be a community meeting at a library or um yeah the the workshops are a good idea because then interested not everybody's interested in discussing community facilities and community development it's boring to some people but those that are actually interested in supporting residents and giving them a voice and empowering them to find different ways to use different facilities and creative ways and get the uses up on the community facilities yeah I think I'm just having more open and honest conversations and not waiting till consultation stages that there's more um opportunities at community board level to discuss these issues can you see can you see an opportunity through which people can get together in in chat yeah yeah and um I was thinking about something else too a residence association so you have you got one that you're active in ah no I'm not active in my one night no but there are quite a few aren't there and that they're also a good vehicle through yeah through which we can have these discussions yeah my concern is that um residents associations get taken over and it becomes a combined voice of the residents rather than every resident gets to say their individual take on the situation and what they would actually like so yeah so I think one of the things to notice is that this is a trying to be an enabling document so there are plenty of community facilities one of my local area for example where they asked the community what type of activities would you like and then they tried to find the right sort of ones for the community yeah so that sounds great yeah and I know the same is happening with them with paul at thank you so much for your time okay next we have graham spinks who's also talking to us on the community facilities network plan on behalf of christchurch martial arts community welcome graeme oh thank you for inviting me um I just wanted to say um that um I don't think there are suitable numbers of facilities in christchurch to meet the needs of the community especially east side um it was one of the the nights that prompted me to call and inquire if I could talk today particularly martial arts groups we tend to hide away and in our white pajamas and small buildings and grapple each other or kick and punch each other to our hearts content but it's been a lot more difficult for a lot of people to engage in this sort of recreational activity that provides discipline in the community since the earthquakes hurt there was a plethora of school halls and especially school halls and scout halls and what have you that have all been taken over by other businesses and oscar businesses etc that are not available now for cheap rate and to provide discipline for our community that need it most and if you want to see what they're doing right now you just need to go outside lynnwood mcdonald's at 11 o'clock on a friday or saturday night and have a look at what they're up to and I challenge people to do that because that's quite a tough thing to do to stand out on the street there and I know that countries that deal with these sort of problems what they do is they they they have these sort of problems and they solve them by engaging after school activities for children at a cheap rate and it's just not happening and you wonder why there's no discipline you wonder why people are assaulted you wonder why kids drift into gangs and you have these social housing issues and drugs and associated problems and they can be solved by careful planning and I think that that's what needs to happen particularly east side west side's been catered for by some rich russian thank god for him areas with olympic sports and I think that's a grand gesture on his behalf but um we need better planning on each side that's for sure and my own circumstances I've run a dojo for years in judo and particularly I've fostered other martial arts because I believe it's a great way to instill disciplines in communities but we were just established with the earthquakes we were on a park we had cheap rates for kits now we had to go to a commercial model it doesn't really suit most people that really need the training and I say these people really need the training when I say that I really mean it I'm talking about kids with problems um anger management problems etc etc that tend to drift in towards martial arts clubs when they can afford it or when the parents can afford to get them there you know and I just don't think we're in the right spot in a commercial venue and I noticed that there's so many around our area and durham street there's to commercial models I mean cripes in other countries in europe they foster martial arts clubs and the reason they foster them is because they want children with self-control in their community with good discipline and good self-defense and that actually drives down the number of assaults at the at the angry age if you train your children well and you discipline them well you don't have problems when they're teens and hit the alcohol crazed stage of life that people tend to roll through and that's been proven so our particular club well and group of clubs we have to have a group of them and uh well we I find it difficult that a third of our members are consistently in arrest and yet we're trying to get a change of use from the city council now we've got we've got to engage architects and engineers um on our side for a change of use that is uh for the city council to get the permits to to to to get a change of use and they're arguing fine points of each I find it insulting well obscene that that that while they're arguing at a combined total of four hundred dollars an hour that some family can't afford to come in and pay fifty dollars a month for their kid to do kickboxing and yet we're paying these same fees you know we're community based and lots of community-based groups are disenfranchised since the earthquakes and covert hasn't helped of course and I just think you know that that if we look after more vulnerable people a lot of things fall into place in society you know you've got to call me a socialist but you know believe in that um okay um are you open to some questions yes so just before we get into other questions my first uh question is what is it that you would like changed in the plan so I know you've got some issues around other stuff I don't think you've got your your ticks and boxes covered by saying that you've got enough um facilities you know you haven't it's in germ street you start looking down there and all these different clubs and organizations are moving into those cheap warehouses and having to take up commercial models because of the lack of facilities and community um at community level you know you look after soccer and rugby they've got fields to play on the likes of martial arts we need these cheap halls to to to foster community spirit and and then they're not there you know it's um swimming in auckland at the commonwealth games um got a new venue where we're boxing and judo we were put in some hall and then after the hall we were just enfranchised as sports while while athletics got a new track and field stadium while swimming got their stadium while a hockey got a stadium you know we we're where's the hat that we can hang out our coat on for martial arts groups so I think we've got a couple of other questions as well so melanie and then yani and then james um within this plan it talks about um being community board that I'm on talked about looking at not just the number of facilities that are around but how much spare time that they have available to take on groups that could use them like space that people could use and also the cost of them do you think that's something that should be included in this plan that then would then give the information that you're I i looked at that the new um stadium that you're going to build right in the center of town and looked at the pricing for the units well you it's unbelievable what are you going to get people you're only going to get professional people from the from the west side of town engaged with that community you're not engaging the east side I mean half the people on the inside they can't afford like they they get they get a full job and then a month later they're only working 20 hours or 10 hours a week I mean how how can they budget their own lives around that sort of getting the kids into clubs and and doing things it's just not feasible from their point of view okay it's just I feel that poverty is is driving a lot of the problems in the in that community and uh you know unless we have affordable affordable activities for the children to engage there's going to be some angry kids out there so I've got yani then james yeah thank you um thank you for the deputation I just wondered if you think there's a need for council to have because the staff advice has been that this this isn't for sports groups this is community facilities plan so just in terms of having moving forward having a sports network plan where the sporting facilities and recreation facilities are clearly shown and gaps identified as as you've said and a process to look at what's needed is that something that you think would be needed it works I can speak to what works within martial arts what I can say what doesn't work when we have the old community centers and come in there and they stomp all over our mats they just respect them that doesn't work only what works for us is we have to have dedicated mat space committed to a particular group so together sharing a facility is fine but they need separate rooms for separate groups and that works better in that in that way because it doesn't work any other way because we don't get the you know like our martial arts particularly we we have a lot of foreigners um involved you know like immigrants I should say immigrants to our country get involved and a lot of poorer well the pacifica community and the um local local um um people it's it's that they are the most of our members I suppose yeah so you know I'm gonna try and get one last question on um pauline um thanks graeme a really good submission um how many group martial arts groups are there in christchurch do you know and is there a collective well before the earthquakes I counted them as 120 and after the earthquakes I down to about half and those that are surviving have to had to adopt a commercial model the thing is we've lost the whole tear of the the considerable number of the cheaper clubs have gone and that's been part of the problem is that they've got nowhere to go right now and they've got it we for instance our club we've kind of we're trying to survive on the edge trying to make fees affordable but we're getting better at the other end with costs because we're in this commercial situation yeah I appreciate that's a really good message to hear and I also fully support the benefits of it as well I believe I believe the numbers are significant I believe that we'd rival hockey if our our combined total of martial artists would would rival the likes of um hockey I wouldn't say soccer but we're we're huge we are okay so we will have to wind up there yep I will do if you just there's just a sec um there's local councillor is but the other issues that you've got at the moment around consenting and things maybe a conversation with the local councillor might be helpful just to look at the process there and the other thing is if you're looking at affordability at the moment and we'll get you in touch with our um funding staff because it may be that there's ways to get some funding for lower income families to help get those kids involved as well through the local community board maybe yeah so we might get some information to you in the in that space as well we'll run out of time now but that's that's not for the topic for today so we'll get some information to you on some um some funding avenues as well and can we hear back from staff on the sports network plan and where that's got to yeah we can yeah I mean we'll do it when we consider yes okay thanks so much graeme thank you thank you very much okay next we have mark gerard canterbury regarding the heritage incentive grants and the intangible grants welcome mark councillors thank you very much I'm I was expecting it it's a verbal submission there's nothing written so you can relax um I wasn't expecting a deputation soon thank you that's on the agenda so this is um thank you for the opportunity to make the submission of deputation which has made reference to the following items on the council agenda before you that's item number 11 the heritage incentive grant funding updates to eligibility and guidelines and number 12 intangible heritage grant fundings guidelines for a new grant scheme the submission will be verbal and brief as historic places canopy wishes to inform the councils that endorses the staff reports recommendations on both agenda items that's the theme turn the specific items on agenda item 11 uh this regards heritage incentive grant funding the strike places request the council has approved the staff recommendations as outlined in the report the proposed changes align the heritage incentive grant funding with the council's our heritage hour tonga heritage strategy 2019 2029 for the formulation and adopting of this heritage strategy hpc considers the expansion of the grant criteria is in keeping with the intent of the heritage strategy covert 19 has had an effect on the christchurch economy whilst thankfully not as marked as the rest of the world resulting in heritage buildings projects that have been postponed hpc endorses the staff recommendations that the unassigned funds be carried over as we expect will be a lift and activity as heritage building projects are reactivated we should point out as the obvious that such funding provides an incentive for owners to invest which should be and will be welcomed by councils as it aids the city's recovery carryover funding allows proposed projects to be reactivated and moving to agenda item 12 intangible heritage grant funding guidelines for a new grant screen hpc recommends the council's approved reports recommendations hpc considers this alliance this this aligns with the council's heritage strategy in developing and diversifying its role in and in support of the city's heritage in this regard hbc request the council's approved the purpose of the that the funding for the intangible heritage grant funding be carried over and finally on another note councillors strike places canopy wishes to thank you for your efforts and we include the council staff in what has been a fragmented year that's an understatement we hope you managed to enjoy some smartphone free quality christmas new year holiday time with your partners and families and as a recovering almost completely recovered political spouse the the importance of the cell phone free area for families where you can't seek and look for your emails when that's when they're not looking for something thank you it's great thank you very much and thank you very much for the very timely advice um I bet my family thanks you um any questions for mark no thank you very much for coming in okay so um presentation of petitions there are none today which is exciting and now we move to the uh community facilities network plan so welcome john paul sylvia is not george and ringo unfortunately no welcome everyone um so we've had the the two engagement um based on the uh reputations we've had today is there anything further that you would look at changing um on that based on that engagement look thank you uh thank you sarah the uh could the this committee saw the uh the draft plan and they uh proposed consultative process back in uh july august and uh we've been out and engaged extensively you can see we've got a a wide range of feedback and the the the council report itself and uh supporting information details how that feedback has been taken on in particular we have uh listened intently and softened the requirement or perceived requirement for facilities to be always developed in partnership we're now very very clear that uh look that's a preference however uh if there are circumstances where there's just not appropriate council will continue to uh take on the lead role that's reflected uh in the plan the it's also been further strengthened in the recommendation that we'd like you to consider I would like to give some reassurance to uh joe and a business plan stage to inform the community board on decision making on community facilities but I would like to re-emphasize the value that we place around community boards as being the decision makers are they are elected and they are closest to their uh communities of interest and we find that with these locally based facilities the uh they uh uh do provide the best decision making forum to answer your question sarah and sorry I've taken some time I would like to re-emphasize the uh the second recommendation where noting that the implementation of this plan will come back to this committee uh in a year's time and I'll probably like to strengthen that recommendation because if there are any changes in the environment changes in facilities changes in the nature of communities of need that are need to be reported and reflected that is the uh the medium to do so so I think what we've heard uh uh kind of strengthens that lastly I'd like to say that uh graeme spinks the uh we've actually spent some time of sports and events uh david bailey the the managers I've been have a talk to graham we do think uh that there is uh uh that there is work that we can do together to uh assist our graham and martial arts and uh if it has taken this community consultation to bring parties closer together well it wasn't expected it wasn't completely in the scope of the plan but I'm very very glad it's happened and they uh we do have capacity to be able to help martial arts they will be treated as community customers at community rates and uh look I think only good can happen from that and we would probably like to invite uh you know graham to come back in a later stage and let us know how things have gone great and um just quickly before we get to um an update er just making sure we've got a note to make sure that we get an update on the um the um sports network plan as well facilities yeah very much so so we've got questions regarding um finance and running the cost of running the centers yeah so you've got a council run centre where council pays for everything they'll pay for the staffing they'll pay for the bookings they'll pay maintenance etc yeah then if you go the other end which is what we're wanting is the community running it getting enough bookings to make itself sufficient etc now not all community facilities are the same you can go from one room facilities which have a very limited opportunity to raise funds to run the thing or a multi-room thing which the team shooting road was very good at that and it was stood on its own feet there must be a hybrid in the middle where we share some costs and that kind of thing hasn't really been addressed in the plan so unless I've missed it yeah yeah paulie in the in the plan there is a there is that there's certainly hybrid there are a couple of examples there are at least five models there of how the council and the community council may be providing a loan and communities get on with it within each of our leases and different arrangements with community groups operating facilities there are different levels of council contribution and this is current practice the so council will play to its strengths and fund where it's most appropriate we will fund structure building structure will fund external maintenance compliance insurance electrical plumbing gas the where communities are able to and where they can through volunteers or fundraising uh look after the internal maybe paint the wall our internal walls cover power cover our cleaning costs because they're better placed to do so through volunteers or community deals we do that so we currently have a a very flexible system of that we also offer community funding uh it's emphasized strongly in the plan that our intent is not to let partner organizations fail success is all playing to our strengths and I think if you were to talk to some of the more recent examples let's say uh project littleton and the littleton center trust the there's a prime example of us succeed if they're not coming so what you're saying is that any um hybrid model let's call it that is sorted out at the time of signing a lease absolutely yeah um yeah and more recently if partner organizations are unwilling to go into a lease with the uh higher level obligations we have what's called an access agreement where we simplify markedly and uh all sides are very very clear on their obligations and we play to our strengths right thank you that's really good answer I appreciate it thank you mike thank you um I know it's in in the um plan and this seemed to be a theme for a number of feedback too um around the city-wide there are currently no significant major geographical gaps in the the network of all council and non-council-owned_._3824.24 facilities are considered not too sure if I agree with that completely but actually one of the best feedbacks I read was actually from the oahuru spreading kashmir community board where they actually said you know that the data's not there to show actually the you start to look at that potentially there will be significant gaps for people that can't actually afford to use many of these facilities so I i just don't think the wording in this yeah right yeah in terms of actually this no gap then yeah mike the uh the wording is carefully chosen and that the there are no significant significant geographical gaps but we we do say uh in a number of areas however look at the uh the north and look at the southwest they look at the north first and then the southwest because geographically that's where you know we're either just upon a gap or a gap is going to come pretty quickly with the infill housing development secondly and most significantly the plan does explicitly say our new developments changes are likely to be driven by changes in community need and changes in circumstance and we quoted the multicultural center as an example of that so but the uh the scenario that you've envisaged and that was raised by uh uh sprayed and cashmere uh are areas that are or groups falling over those are the sorts of community needs the changes in demographic which will trigger the need to look at new or changed facilities and if we haven't made that explicitly clear we can certainly strengthen that wording yeah it's just to me when I look at it we don't know if there's gaps because we don't actually know the cost to the communities to hire all these buildings and actually if we knew that then it may suddenly say actually these buildings aren't accessible to a number of people in the community then suddenly there is a gap already in existence in this community so to me it's just a little bit too generic I guess and it's not really saying what the true um situation is for certain communities probably is there a change that you'd like or additional information based on that or you're just expressing a concern because it talks about it specifies geographic and your concerns about access to those ones in the geographic spaces is that right so would you like're going to add to that no no the just uh just uh to note that under the implementation plan one of the uh actions is to collect more information on facilities that council doesn't own the so when I referred earlier to uh reporting back to the community years time on the implementation plan we would aim to have uh filled a lot of that uh gap of information to allow better decision making it's just part of the process we're not in a position to report it now when it comes to community facilities that are council owned that's something that when it comes to affordability we're in charge of for fees and charges okay thanks um jimmy and then tim then end in mail but still when we take over over the to secure a piece of land these two men they can build up their own facility all they can you know long-term kind of permanently can you know to lease a council on the facility just permanent not just just one or two times long time once a week they these needs yes sorry I don't understand the question so jeremy are you making this because so jimmy when it comes to the plan this plan um are there concerns that you've got with this plan does it not say because it talks about communities that need and and says that we will help communities that need for those communities to go to the community boards or to those areas in council to assist them to facilitate the facilities this yeah john do you have anything to add there yes yes yes I do the firstly we the council still has a uh 17 19 facilities for hire 17 17 facilities for hire art around the city and we are we're happy to take bookings from all areas of the community the reason that we choose to hire a number of these facilities is to make sure that they're accessible secondly we've got a multicultural committee and staff working on implementing a multicultural strategy which includes reaching out to different communities and assisting them directly thirdly we've got community development staff working with community time the issues come up and we provide solutions probably lastly we have funding relationships with a large amount of ethnically diverse community organizations in order to provide access to facilities for events and other activities that sort of allow us to increase the celebration of cultural diversity in the city so there are a number of mechanisms probably outside the scope of this plan which is largely you know facility-based uh time and thank you john um go follow on from what um graeme brought and went in the old days you know you used to turn up and you you'd be able to put the bags and things for boxing or whatever it was type one dough whatever it was under you know you'd have to like the old stage in the hall you'd have your area yeah and a lot of the stuff was you know your gloves and stuff are personal yeah with our new um facilities that we've built what's do we take that type of thing into account because it'd be hard to say lease a building to it is that one the right track or yeah a couple couple of things from uh from my experience the uh the martial arts uh they need mats they uh some facilities when the martial arts use is not sort of predominant it's not huge we will have spaces that the mats can be stored and then moved out and you can have your session and move back again the more that facility is used for the activity and the higher level of that activity the less convenient it is to move these things in and out if the facility gets too specialist the value of the equipment and the time taken and the safety implications of setting it up and pulling it down get prohibitive so the issue will be as the activity grows a question with us is you'll reach the point where you probably need exclusive use of that facility and in certain facilities yes that's absolutely fine in other facilities when those agreements come before community boards who are the deciders they will weigh up the public interest in having a range of serving a community like the martial arts community well and and having it a lot more dedicated to that facility so let's say rather than having it dedicated to say judo which needs the mats a lot of them need the hanging points for the so would there be an opportunity to look at a facility and say cross lease to a number of martial arts or boxing would it cross and that would be a discussion that we would have probably led by david bailey in rec sports and events and it's uh yeah the once you start getting into a specialization like that it moves out of the general purpose community facility more into a recreational and sport facility I know from talking with david last night they do have capacity and they do have facilities and it might be a very very useful conversation with graham and other members of the martial arts community uh they might get a lot of benefit out of this morning tell you the truth that's great thank you and then mel yep thank you it's incredibly complex think about and organise so a couple of questions following on from joanna's point about elected members change and the knowledge of the community changes with that how are you thinking that that knowledge will continue and be yeah yeah very very good question yeah the uh a number of things have improved we now have a far superior very comprehensive asset management plan uh in place the uh the latest iteration that we included uh was uh july we're just about to sign off a december an awful lot of the this institutional information is captured in that plan it's in trim it's our records it's kept up to date and it's very thorough the second thing that this exercise has allowed us to do is build up the first ever big picture of facilities their properties their capabilities in and around town and of course we're not there yet we've started we aim to work with our smart cities people to have a really good interactive map where you can a member of the public can ping on to a organizations to say this is the uh huntsbury hall it's available for hire xyz it's dimensions of this its price is this it's an improvement task in the plan the should you guys uh uh approve the plan today and we would aim to report back to this committee in a year's time to let you know how we've uh how we've got on and essentially it's a it's a wee bit of an extension to what uh mike was saying councillor davidson earlier on the uh uh mikes were more questions were more how can you inform planning how can you identify areas of need your question is how do we let people know about these things where do we keep this information so there's that there's there's two fast sources of truth that uh truth wrong word but uh two fast sources of information that we were considering that's fantastic and I think um giving that information regularly to maybe even annually to the community board so what's what's just reminding and and great because that was my question whether you could do that because it's a fantastic place for people to get information and if they could just push on and say you know what do I need and when is it available how much is it going to cost the cost thing is is interesting obviously it's a barrier any thoughts about um how we could make it more equitable in terms of the sort of things that graham was talking about the the costs for the cost for council facilities are in councillor's control and they discuss it annually the uh generally speaking partnership agreements the if we have a lease it is at a peppercorn the uh and the and the uh uh the the costs are divided between the council contributions I said and the uh the uh operator contribution we always aim for the operator to be able to charge a modest amount to cover their costs so they are sustainable if there's a gap it's community funding or a different lease arrangement and they're bespoke depending on the the nature of people want to go to we need less help older ones that are clearly in need of a bit of maintenance the but nevertheless very valuable to the community uh we all provide more help thank you mel and then yani um two questions um one um can you comment on what graham was talking about with the change of use like because I didn't understand what that was referring to or yeah I think he's got a uh consenting issue I think they're doing a change of use for a building yeah that they currently have it's not a community facility yeah so yeah the second point um was um really what mike talked about before um what our community board was talking about was affordability but it was also just basically availability I mean you could have 10 community centres in one block but if they're all filled up all the time you can't get in there then there's no availability yeah so um and and I know that staff responded to that but I really feel like and I should do have a sentence in there about facility asset condition and works underway to look at that for council facilities I really think that we should actually have um something in there that says it works underway to assess availability and affordability of council owned facilities to determine significant gaps because you did respond back to say that you would work with community boards to see if there are any gaps but if we're stating a sentence in this plan that says there are no significant geographical gaps so that's a fact it reads as a fact and it may not necessarily 100 true yeah I mean yeah so are we able to have a sentence in there that talks so just so the wording that you've got I just wrote it down I can email it I think we added to the add it to the editor we go into and put it formally in the implementation plan yeah that would are you happy with that yeah cool so if you flick it through to aiden that would be great okay yanny thanks um I was community managed facilities governance to assess whether how it's working and whether this is the right approach going forward like have we done any sort of in-depth assessment of um the skills of community governance the ability that the strengths weaknesses but not a lot because it was outside the scope of the plan when when we first looked at the scope of the plan with the antecedent social housing community development committee and subsequently this committee we were reasonably specific about what the plan would cover and what it wouldn't_:_4804.96 and uh the capacity of community organizations uh as is uh wasn't wasn't included in the scope the uh but look what I what I can say is we have a uh considerable investment on an ongoing basis through either civic-based staff such as paul and sylvia and community-based staff are located in every single ward who liaise directly with community groups help where they can uh they try not to impose and sometimes were I said look you know I i keep away we invest considerable sums and things like leadership lab where we these processes are operative I certainly can't_''_4858.639 say that uh every group is functioning and functioning well but what I can say is there's an awful lot of centers out there that are run incredibly well uh they've got uh uh engaged clientele they uh you know and from time to time we support them they uh uh we did an exercise uh immediately post covered where we approached about 230 community-based organizations and the feedback was largely yep we're okay but we might need some support and a lot of the feedback was reflected in the advice we provided to uh uh the committee you convened the uh regarding the uh strengthening communities fund so there are a wide range of support mechanisms out there working alongside this plan because the scope of this plan wasn't actually the the health of community organizations probably in addition the uh our community development uh team and our strategy and policy team have recently done some work on community capacity and that will be uh shared with boards uh in the in the near future so I're adopting a sort of high level principle to have more community managed facilities but we don't understand in in sufficient detail we haven't done any review of the way in which these facilities have been community run then it feels like a gap so yeah if I compare it to the board of trustees which I think I emailed around councillors like the ministry of education has done something quite similar looking at schools and how they are governed and managed and it's quite interesting when you read through that the parallels but what we have just heard from john is that that specific stuff was actually outside of the scope of the plan when that was developed by the previous committee which you set on and that that work is ongoing we have repetitively raised every briefing we've had at our board and at workshops to the appropriate committee the key question has consistently been raised what review have we done of community managed facilities to identify the challenges that they've faced so that we can we can learn from it so you not through lack of being raised and I just think going forward like if because I get the community development stuff that's probably the easiest part of this the more difficult issue is around things like human resources employment law uh and and probably the legal aspects of some of these uh ways in which community management is okay we're dealing with a network facilities plan right now we can take that offline and that's fine I'm keeping track of it is to give like and we're still talking about increasing community managed council facilities and developing the capacity of the communities to be able to do that at the same time so can we get an action then that actually looks at how the community managed ones have been functioning to review the adequacy or inadequacy of that and look at what's required going forward I mean I i would have thought that's a problem you've given some context there that's fine we'll lead to john so can we add it to the implementation plan it's not part awful lot of work and I would want to be able to work with my colleagues identify the scope of an exercise like that and bring it back to this committee so they could talk about this in terms of other organizational priorities before before committing so john we listen it's a really good point have a look at the scope would it be fair to say that if there and I know that there have been cases in the past where there has been some concerns about how a facility is being run all managed or if an organisation is struggling yeah what has happened in that case yeah the uh the the uh uh uh recent example don't give a recent example just just generally yeah yeah generally speaking first of all a conversation is undertaken uh in a discreet way so it's not seen that the council or the community are bowling in and muscling or or committing to a predetermined result usually there's a conversation how are you going is there anything we can assist with the the conversations usually happen through ask elected members to uh uh to move in a very successful uh way of doing this is the way we managed uh I think anyway uh at community-based early learning centers where we did uncover a raft of issues the uh and through gary watson's team were able to produce a uh a one-stop shop council response which required some funding collaboration with the ministry of development who looked after a lot of the skills-based stuff collaboration with our asset team and we've now got a uh you know a safe and secure network uh going forward so uh that there are the provisions to do that and uh I probably also like to say that uh where we where we say look at preference working partnerships going forward we've got three live examples they're all mentioned in the implementation plan there's some albums community center working with a community organization sarah they're independent they're capable they're coming to us uh and we're going to them with ideas on how we play to our strengths and it seems to be library again robust good organization need assistance in certain areas and not in other areas the third one's manuka cottage they are again that they're all going pretty well they uh those are sort of live examples at the moment they uh uh if any organizations are experiencing difficulties we are here to help and we've got the capacity to do that so we just wind up this particular one so yanI's requested some further work be done to look at a whole review of all of our facilities that are that are managed um of course they would only do council facilities and not all the other community ones do people want a scoping thing done on that um or just leave it to staff on a case-by-case move to the community boards so someone raises something that that's fine but um do people generally want staff to go away and do this extra bit of work for us or are we just happy to leave it for now andrew I think it leads to a further question to what extent what we know in partnership um to what extent has that influenced what's in um this particular plan and I'm assuming it has if we can be confident that what we know about the the good the bad and the otherwise of the way that we're doing this in partnership with groups already and there are good examples out there and there are good examples out there of where it hasn't worked so well or where there have been some speed wobbles that have come good I think if we can be confident that all of that is um been used to inform what we've got in front of us then we wouldn't need any further work to be done thank you okay um so if you know pauline is yours addressing that and as you always addressing that point of views okay that's on yeah it was on his point yeah because his his issue is something um that isn't a problem in our area but it sounds like um I can think of two in our community board area which have been dealt or a member of the community or the group itself I think just being worked with the staff we've got a couple of live examples in in this in your collective area at the moment that we're working on okay so what I think at the moment is that we um we don't well well there's been an individual concern raised about that but we don't it seems like the meeting generally doesn't need further information on that so we won't take it as an action point but yani I'm happy to chat to you about it offline to see if there's anything further we can do without um adding to the workload of staff on that particular point at the moment so move on to the next point um pauline thank you um I will hang on we'll just we'll just go back around again so going back to the affordability issue um it could go the other way potentially where um a community or some organisation is running the center and their prices go up and they a lease in place but would it also be quite good to construct an mou with anyone that's so that we have an expectation in there that they're also um you know on the same page as council and providing a service yeah pauline yeah the very good point the our most recent work in that area uh and I'll uh I'll use the littleton recreation center in their uh activation agreement which is not at least because they didn't want that all the legal implications of the lease there is a clause in there over setting fees and charges that they are reasonably consistent with councils fees and charges the uh uh and if there is a decision to uh uh to change markedly that this is uh discussed with uh community governance staff and if necessary with the community board okay thank you and one last question insurance does council cover insurance for all the facilities we always cover building insurance the uh uh we uh invite well we insist that uh organizations are leasing facilities and at times activating facilities get our for themselves we give really good advice on the level at which they should get and where to go to get the the very best price it's not usually prohibitively expensive but we do take that into account when we're setting uh lease charges or the amount of services that council will pay for we may do extra maintenance we may do the grounds if the organization you know would struggle to get public uh uh public water insurance you should get that and we should do the grounds rather than we buy public liability insurance for someone else okay okay um ending yanni thank you sorry you're getting a bit of a work over this morning john I'm just it's been 30 months weeks back today thank you just thinking about future need and growth and um monitor population increases south west and north of the city and advocate for the inclusion of community facilities and wider town planning processes can you explain a bit about that process what that looks like yeah yes I can and again I'll probably refer to to that we've got our eyes on through this plan firstly it's it's the the north between our belfast and sort of preston's area there's a lot of development southwest of the uh so as new properties are being consented as communities are being planned our goal is to talk with our urban planners and our development to keep abreast of the increased population and in the town planning processes where firstly we can secure land and then secondly secure the requirement for a community facility or indeed another another development so it's a joined up approach through the uh council that one on a council-wide basis would probably be led by paul and his team in civic working with local teams but we'd also work with town planning transport and our colleagues and and recreation sport and parks to provide that joined up uh approach maybe community boards could have a bit of a in terms of recognizing the need for growth that would be fantastic once we've done the higher work we certainly gave the board the board of the center very much okay so I'm aware that we've spent a significant amount of time on this already yannI's got another question and mike if you've got any changes that you'll talk about earlier could you flick those through thanks in response to the submissions I note that there was concern around the working with schools um so I just wondered if we'd considered strengthening anything to do with the ministry of education obviously the shirley boys the old you know facility that could have been used for community pretty tragic what happened there and I know council is going to have an mou with the moe but we don't seem to have had much progress on that I don't know how other people feel but just listening to the submission this morning particularly around that martial arts it does seem to me that we're missing a huge opportunity to work with the ministry of education yeah in I have to say that we we work with the ministry of education uh uh deeply and regularly and I think gave the last when say someone like joanna gould talked about stakeholders yeah certainly ministry of education are our stakeholders school groups are are users of our facility and I think you can take you know it's inherently included in the plan that we would work with uh our schools and education providers we we do that as a matter of course my personal opinion probably doesn't need some strengthening but uh if there's a desire to have that strength and we'll we'll be happy to do it because we do it anyway yeah I know in areas like red cliffs we've managed to work with the ministry to have buildings and stuff too and same in new brighton but we've got we seem to have a very ad hoc system for working like I don't know if you guys remember when ministry came in with a big map with all the properties that they were looking at and we actually had some quite good conversations to start with but we haven't had that for several years now and also it seems to be if you're just actually the shirley boys auditorium classic okay so is there specific wording that you would like changed in the plan or would you like a another discussion on that at another time uh yeah I think it'd be good to put it I think it's a fair implementation plan is that we ask for a um an emoji to be signed with the ministry of education about how we can make the most out of community facilities you have to have two to sign an agreement so there's only one talking so so are you happy to add some wording in there um that you know council staff work with the ministry for education um to make the best use of um community opportunities opportunities something like that yeah okay so because of respect I mean staff already said that they felt that didn't need to be strengthened it's already in there and I don't think it does either I think that we're always on the lookout for opportunities like that sam might be happy at a second yeah some wording going in if it's if it's already there it's just it's just repeating something that's already there um and if it moves us on right now I'm sure why don't you you know regarding implementation until the december of next year report back to the committee because I'm concerned they caused two different uh kind of of the the uh annual plan you know probably start in the june that's for this year financial because while I reveal 5.4 paraguay first the bully point the last bully point all in relation to the funding for groundwork maintenance and funding you know to operate so that it caused the two kind of annual plan or long-term plan a moment uncertainty for long-term plan how come to report back I don't know whether maybe june is based on july is the best time jimmy this is only on the implementation this is reporting back on the implementation it's not about funding new facilities it's not about funding for new facilities but because it's in december it will yeah I think we might just um try and wind that up now unless there's any I think phil's moving it and sam's second sure sure um yeah so we've got some additional stuff on here okay so if everyone has a look up on the screen for the wording are people comfortable with that is there anything except oh you've put it through excuse me sarah I'm wondering if we could get it a bit bigger the text it's actually really cool sorry quite difficult to to read and she's got glasses on too I'll remember that sam and we have to make the big time and I think mike said he sent some wording through to ayden I was actually asking on behalf um okay so it may not need to be an amendment though so if sam and phil are happy if yep once it's up for a resolution it's just an amendment in the document isn't it yeah but that would need to be passed by a recommendation it basically just says to take to the city-wide map of the distribution of facilities and figures degrees provides an overview of all council and non-council owned facilities across the district so you're not distinguishing between geographical gaps and then the access to those facilities I'm really sorry for interrupting but I cannot hear anyone who doesn't switch on me tonight apologies mike mike everything I was saying was really good mike's one I just want to replace there's a couple of sentences on page 27 of the agenda it refers to the no significant major geographical gap when you look at both community council and community owned facilities I disagree and a lot of the feedback we've received also disagrees with that so I just wanted to change that to show that actually that figure 3 just provides the overview of all the um council and non-council owned facilities and actually not mention the fact that there are no significant magic gaps because I think that's subjective okay for my point I actually ideally wanted to include it within the document because that would sort of have worked upon assessing a condition if we see about doing what mike said is fine and then having it in the implementation plan is good yeah I mean john my impression would be that it wouldn't change the guidelines to how we make the decisions no no wouldn't it work it's just it just takes out something removed that has got people's yeah yeah the document through you sarah is a decision-making framework yeah that remains entirely intact and uh uh we we'd be comfortable with that uh that sentence being removed it wouldn't change anything I'm wondering if um one a could be amended slightly to include the words um current and future so continue to develop capacity in current uh current and future um in the community to operate and activate so I'm worried I'm worried about future future facilities yeah yeah I'm wondering how we're after activate activate current and future is that okay does that make sense yeah okay thank you okay so we just need to um are people generally comfortable with mike's amendment out as an amendment but copy and put it in so it'd be 1d it would come in there because it's a change to the draft are you going to be happy with these changes sorry I'm going to say no it can't_''_6241.679 be there oh just wait for the wordsmithing's done what's that we just then actually got the wording right before we debate it that would be most things okay that's looking good right okay so we have this um wordsmith and formatted and phil would you like to open the debate or would you like to just leave it and close it at the end that's the best two that's the best two-word debate we've had oh you look just very very quick but it's a huge piece of work and thank you very much and I think that it signifies a dramatic shift actually in the way council's working and just to actually have community-led organizations coming up I think the issue with the um the mapping is the fact that we we have you might include churches in those so um you know what we really need is enough facilities that are just for residents and run by the community or council but preferably community for the residents we've addressed affordability and accessibility and those two things are very very important um and the way I see this is it's it's a living document I see it as a living document I see it as being containing some flexibility because you know it's not one size fits all and that's the key thing we've got to remember with community facilities and a certain amount of the mapping is actually comparing apples with pears you've got different facilities in different communities you've got facilities that are big and multi-roomed and you know they can apply to lots of different interests in the community and therefore they have an ability to bring in more income and other facilities that are very small and are much more limited so it's a very broad and diverse piece of work this but as I say to me it's communities and I think the driver of these things has to be community boards and the relationship with the community development teams and the council staff all working together with communities to keep an eye on things and I think this this is a big step forward so thanks for the amazing amount of work and I'll be supporting this today thanks paul and we've got andrew tim then mel um thank you I'd also like to acknowledge um all of the work that's gone into this I mean this has taken some time to put together as a plan which is I'm capable of approval today and the conversations that led to it and that started this piece of work have been going on through various annual plans long-term plans activity plans conversations at community board conversations in the community um for a very long time in fact even since before the time I was elected to a community board in 2010 so it's good to see this finally land in a plan um which is in front of us um in this or the perceived requirement for there to be a partnership in place for a community facility to to be developed I think we always need to bear in mind that different communities have got different degrees of capacity capability and willingness to enter into a partnership and often it's those communities where there's greatest need for community facilities where it's least likely that we'll find a community organization which is is able to partner that's not across the board and of course that speaks to another matter that this plan I think reflects quite well which that was not only com not all um community facilities are the same and pauline made that point very well not all communities are the same so we we cannot take a one one-size-fits-all approach we need the flexibility to work with different communities if in different ways according to their capacity capability willingness and so on um and in that regard we've got the table figure four which has got the different um capacities that council and community community can have in various different relationships and my out and and sets out opportunities that there's plenty of flexibility even within that table at figure four to realize that different facilities different communities will require different approaches some of which we may not have even thought of yet but um now in general um I i welcome this piece of work I think it reflects a direction that we've been wanting to move in for some time um and I look forward to seeing seeing it been implemented and getting that report back thank you I think we'll start the timer for the next ones um so we have tim then melvin then and then jimmy um thank you a lot and I thank you to staff for um this is a huge step forward and it's a huge amount of work so thank you um I guess just the the thing in the back of my mind is when a resident came to us and talked to us about residents coming rather than groups or committees or whatever so to ensure that that connection to a facility for all residents rather than just suspects and those that are um governing those community facilities through and for the council and their communities are open to all residents and we have to ensure that that is the case and also that good connection to our community boards so I think that's the best way forward with that and we've got to ensure that so I'd be really deeply concerned and disappointed if that were not the case so um I think that that's really going to be taken on board and listened to but also with our community facility uh our community board staff as well so yeah I think that's the real key for me too thank you very much no timer required on that one sir thank you mal vignani then and then jimmy um I mean I think community facilities are very um important especially um probably to community boards because they are local facilities um I'd like to thank john and paul for being amenable to all the changes that we've suggested because I think that's very important community facilities are really important or they've lost their facility and then we then we build one for them or we help them in that process and it's not easy even if you've got a partner it can take eight to ten years to get a facility back up and running or built again um and sometimes there's the opposite where there's an empty building and you're trying to find um you know I've been through the process of trying to find people who will who will run that space and that is a difficult one and it relies on our community development advisors and the support of the board and rallying individuals in the community to get together who don't know each other to um to be able to do something and they can do it but they can't do it alone they need community governance staff and community board members to be behind there and it can happen so um it really is important for developing community capacity building and all that that some people um don't don't necessarily have or believe themselves so um yeah I just think this is really um important for us I think thanks mel um yani um I i think yeah I appreciate the work that's been done on this and I'm happy with about um 80 of it but the 20 that I'm really uncomfortable with is the 1b2 which is increasing the number of council-owned facilities operated and activated by community organizations and I know you've put some slightly more wording at the end around appropriate capacity and capability but to me this feels very much like the tomorrow schools model and I think we really need to look at the assessment of how that's worked or not worked and what's really clear from from that review which I spent a lot of time reading so there's no evidence to suggest that current self-governing schools model has been successful in raising student achievement or improving equity as was intended and it goes on to say children from disadvantaged homes too many maori and pacific families and those with significant additional learning needs remain those most poorly served that review is that for far too often we put huge governance and statuary responsibility on boards of trustees and I don't think that's unsimilar to the idea that the community should run council-owned facilities it's not to say that there's not a place for it and I support it where it can happen but I don't think we should set a goal of sort of in a key direction of trying to increase it that should be done when the community wants to do it not us saying this is something that we're going to push you towards which I feel that um this part of the strategy does I think what's really important though is that we do have community input and just not having community governance of facilities or community management doesn't mean that you wouldn't have community representation around focusing on the things that are important to that community and again just to stress that's one of the key things that came out of the board of trustees review into tomorrow's schools was that people technical building maintenance issues often don't have the the understanding and the expertise in those fields and can spend a lot of time focusing on that rather than on the key things which is what's important to that community so I strongly disagree with the approach that we're taking around increasing the number of our facilities that we want the community to run I think it will have devastating consequences in parts of the city and I don't support that direction but the the other final thing I point I wanted to make is that you know people just say that the ministry of education is working well with us as a city I i just can't_''_6939.52 um accept that we definitely need to improve that relationship what happened and surely we had a perfectly good hall being left vacant for a number of years vandalised at a huge expensive cost to the taxpayer was just an absolute tragedy that should never have happened and we did try after the earthquake to get some agreement with the ministry of education how we could work with and the ones that they had vacated and that clearly hasn't worked so I support doing more in that space so just ask you put the um the resolution separate particularly 1b2 thanks yani and kiara and thank you thank you for the work that's been done I know it's been huge um and this is I think all about strengthening the voice of our community boards and and managing and planning for facilities in their local area and so getting that local knowledge is is vital and knowledge is power so I'm really pleased that you're going to be giving information to the community board that will help them to understand what's available in their communities how it's being used and they can use that knowledge to then better um equip and fulfill the needs of the community so thank you for the work that you've done we are totally supportive of what you've got here in front of us it's great thank you thanks angeli thank you I just want to remind our first time counselor actually this and integrate with all the other cultures multi-ethnic community group they make the submission during the annual plan or long-term plan in that time start you know feedback to the council particularly emphasis would like to know to uh the established community facility network plan so am I right jung I remember it's kind of you know they saw this uh take probably uh two and a half years already but at least you know this is kind of a guiding document it's even it's not a kind of standard but at least it is the principle you know we can follow the this principle guideline you know to engage or even uh work in a partnership with the other community and also this community we are all aware it's not only the geographic community actually cover all the demographic immunity so different community probably have a different the request but anyway this one my view you know actually let's maximize all those uh the facility to be the utility you know to fill the gap between the demand from the wider community and from you know provider etc so that's good at the beginning but we got the further one I think from now on the the after the one year that's very very crucial and important or we can take at least one year engage all those kind of the wider community can gather the kind of of the first-hand information so after one year december last year when the staff presented to this community we can gather overall picture and have fun further the amendment for this kind of plan and for the future the practical needs so I think that's very very crucial so jenny speaking I fully support at least thanks to me mike thank you and I'll be quick um look thanks for the work and obviously this has taken a long time to actually get to this point and you know although the plan obviously has a little bit of strategic context in there the reality this is a stock take um of where we currently sit in terms of council owned facilities and community owned facilities that's what it is and I are but we just got to be a little bit careful I guess when we look at that to realize not all facilities created equal and the ability for community groups to access them is limited depending on that group's ability so I think this is really good it's going to aid in our decision making as we move forward and working out where there are gaps but it's how we actually try and get the data through to actually show where the true gaps are and not where the gaps looked to be thank you phil would you like to close the debate oh leanne leanne yep the end yes I wasn't going to contribute to this debate but um I think yanI's comments really have compelled me to do so I really want to focus on the words appropriate capacity and capability to do so if you had approached the aranui community trust in the year 2000 and said to them would you like to run the local facility actually they would have said yes back then because it would have been better group running it um but uh but in fact uh the the the um the work that went into that community developing a sense of trust and building capacity and capability on the ground has actually enabled that community to find itself in an equivalent position to the to the littleton community which had that capacity um and I think andrew's identified that uh right from the uh get-go when the earthquakes happened both communities were in the position to step up and really support their communities in a very upfront and personal way but with incredible capacity and capability and in a disaster we all know that these communities find within themselves they have this capability and and capacity which is why I never like to um refer to the um to to a phrase that suggests that we're giving them something that we're empowering them the power is within that's just the question of um self-belief and the ability to actually act I think that our facilities are an ideal base for building capacity and capability within communities and so I do want to to pay tribute to the community of arunui I'd like to pay tribute to the community of littleton because they represent the very best of what we can be and what a number of communities across the city would aspire to be um if they were given a sense of trust and belief by their local council so I do urge councillors to support the whole resolution thank you um and with that I will I'll put them all together but if you'd like to have your vote recorded against any of those just let us know which ones 1b2 okay so all in favor please say aye any against the whole thing no and just the only record up against 1b2 thank you okay um so we will break now and we will come back in 15 minutes so at 11 35 and we'll see if we can get the rest of it finished by the lunch break will be really good thank you very much it sounds good uh no I mean we've um spoken quite extensively and talked about the climate change now um intending to go out for public consultation in parallel with the ltp and also the recommendation that we set up a working group of elected members are there any questions uh mike fignani so just just quickly um so so there's no risk of this not being ready to go out for consultation confident that it'll be already it will be all ready we're well down the track um with the development we've got a really like a close to a final draft which um we met with um sarah recently and we're just making some incorporating some final feedback and then we'll share that with councillors um uh next year early next year okay and the other one um 5.17 on page 56 it says following counsellor feedback staff will also consider opportunities for further stakeholders so will you do it in august uh we've had some discussions um we don't intend to do any more sort of formal pre-engagement we've taught through where maintaining contact with our we call it the technical advisory group but there's chamber of commerce so we are keeping them informed and following the last briefing we've asked for their feedback on some of the modeling work so we will yeah continue to engage through our networks rather than any other formal engagement okay thank you thanks johnny yeah thanks um I was just saying in the report um under five points it's just on the finance of seven sorry 7.1 cost to implement um it proved the cost of establishing the working grade will be met from existing budgets um expected to be low and would be met with an existing budgets funding source existing operational budgets but given how much pressure we've had on our budgets can you at least give us some sense of what the cost anticipated will be so the cost of the working group would effectively be staff time so there's no other additional cost of establishing a working group so to speak that this doesn't include the costs of actually dealing with climate change and any additional work for other policies and things as part of this yeah I know that we've got to reduce the number of meetings we've got other parts of the organization telling us that we don't have resourcing capacity to get stuff done we're now doing something new but we don't have any sense of the financial cost but also also actually um what other things may get deferred if we aggressive I mean I'm not against it but I just think we should have visibility about how this can actually be delivered in our current financial situation because yeah priorities so staff have given us advice that it is able to be done within current budgets imagine if there's anything that will be bumped to be able to do this no we wouldn't envisage that I mean it's it is staff time but we are spending that time um already really um in our you know liaison preparation for presenting to this committee and council so it will just be um a more formalized arrangement of a working group where staff and elected members to get together so it won't have any impact on you know water supply which I'm told we can't we don't have resources to do that's not gonna things like that are not gonna impact on strategy and planning that's not gonna get delayed more because they're different staff are they is it which stuff is that strategy and planning um yeah so this is in um the strategic policy team so the natural environment team so it would be myself um and members from the policy team and natural staff team yeah so cool um just yeah the only other um thing I wanted to check is like um this is really good and it's really important and I'm just concerned that a number of council-controlled organizations and companies are doing their own thing is there any ability to come up with a joint strategy across our council companies around how we respond to climate change so that we I guess we seem to be on the same page but also not not surprising each other or having a more consistent approach I'm just mindful of the deputations we heard here around their concern at what was going on and it did seem a bit disconnected so I just wondered if if there's any thought to what we can do to get a more joint up approach with our council organisations and companies I mean we absolutely recognise that we are going to need to do this in partnership with the community and as well as our um other ccho companies the I think they're uh we've shared the strategy with them um and they've participated in workshops and have input into that so I think there will always be um tensions in terms of some of the competing kind of priorities um but that is just something we will need to tackle as part of addressing climate change one I think there's really good opportunities so we are talking with orion and we see that some of the work that they are doing around measurement and offsetting so we are very much ensuring kind of sharing expertise and working closely with those companies but no so the um the consultation will go out in we still need to work out with the hearings team exactly how that will form the working group is separate to that we would like to get a working group set up and established so that we can get that input and ideas as we develop the strategy and on some of the current work that we are doing so the working group is intended to um yeah sort of oversee and have oversight of the implementation of the climate change strategy so it's more than just hearing the submissions I would envisage we'll have a hearings panel we just need to talk yes yes absolutely so we just need to speak with megan pearce about how that will fit in but yes there will be a hearings panel to hear the submissions on the strategy no we will come back when we present the um final draft strategy for approval we'll then provide some more detail and information on the hearings process thank you okay are there any further questions if not do I have a mover for the report uh mike and jimmy okay is I think that um just the consultation with the communities is really important because we've got to take everybody with us and if we don't take the community with us and it becomes a council climate um then that's kind of going to miss the point so um yeah I think it's really good thank you very much for the work you've done thank you jimmy yeah would like to oh sorry sorry yeah it's wider than those kind of working group and through all the all the regular and the formula consultation policies so we look forward to this document leading us you know to fully the compliance with our information on climate change the emergence declaration thank you all right thank you very much and with that I will put it all in favor please say aye any against I got to bear that carried katie and emma thank you so much for your work on this thank you and now we move to the community loan scheme so we have sam come and talk to that and sam you were looking what everyone says good morning questions okay I'll take it as read and sam's got a question cool um thanks sam so just on this uh you've talked about the ability for the club to repay yes you've obviously taken quite a conservative approach I've had some correspondence with them sort of in the last 24 hours where they've talked about the approach they've taken is quite conservative as well so let's see the the 40 grand loan will basically minimize I guess their reserves um but at the same time if they would if they were able to have a slightly a bit more um there'll be additional savings for them which means they might be able to repack quicker do you guys have a view on the sort of conservative approach that was taken or to our assessment yeah yeah sure I think it explains in the matrix kind of where the finance unit took it and I went with them on that which was that they have cash flow sorry for the massive papers they've got kind of financial statements um of around about seven thousand dollars and the repayments on the 40k loan is about five and a half so we're leaving them a little bit of buffer there so as you say an increase from 40 to say 50 000 would give them a bit more of a buffer in this project and some comfort if they don't need that I'm sure they'd be happy to repair earlier and that would work if they did need it then it would put a little bit more financial pressure over the next few years as they repay um but not beyond what's conceivable so what would be the like in your I guess professional assessment the maximum you would go to so there's a recommendation there but what would the level of comfort be from the organization in terms of how high if we were to change that number it could go yeah um that's a might be a question for john I feel that's um 40 was this the spot that we felt would not put them under be enough for them to successfully complete their project but I i wouldn't want to go higher than 50. there's a staff recommendation okay because I have had that hundred thousand dollar loan in the past they have yeah they've got a good track record a stable club yeah okay well look can I just signal then that I'm happy to move that subject to changing it to 50 000. you can move 50. and tim's happy to second no any question um if it was 50 000 would that be over eight years uh that's as it stands at the moment yeah if it was 50 000 would it be over eight years rather than say 10. okay so just sorry just answer in more detail I've been looking at my spreadsheet trying to do that while answering um to to increase it to 50 000 over eight years would increase their annual um repayment on the loan to 6700 6778 which puts them kind of just below what their annual um kind of cash flow reserves are so it's on the the correspondence I've had with them is that there's additional sources of revenue that they can invest in um that other squash clubs and the like are using so yeah they seem pretty comfortable with it the extra 10 000 would that allow them to do something else to the building that would allow them to get extra income yep there's two different aspects which will get them a couple of thousand more a year so okay yep okay um nelly do you think sam it might be better to make it over 10 years or do you think I'm comfortable with eight okay um I mean we've seen with other loans if it becomes an issue council has been pretty approachable around resetting terms etc and future councils are of the same mind then it wouldn't be an issue but to help these orcs not be burdened with debt forever it's good to you know try and push it a bit short if we can okay any further questions no any day yeah just really briefly I mean to me this enable the community so and this virtually provides no cost to the ratepayer there's you know an interest which is higher than what we borrow it for which enables them to partner with the burnside rugby club and to you know really get some tangible assets on effectively land that's ours um they've got a really proven track record and as you'll know I'm relatively conservative for this stuff but the fact that I'm asking for an additional 10 grand on their behalf should give you some comfort that I don't think they're going to show up not being able to pay it back um so I'd be really grateful if everyone can support it thanks sam um anyone else no in that case I'll put that all in favor please say aye any against declare that carried okay so we're next moving to the discretionary response fund so that's you again sam yeah and I've come to join them that's required welcome gary so gary's been long time no see bear has been very so he'll answer questions related to the specific application excellent I'll take it as read um is there anything you need to add no any questions do I have a mover ann and seconded melanie is there any debate no in that case I'll put that all in favor please say aye any against carried just like that nice to see you gary yeah yeah merry christmas um heritage incentive grant funding updates to eligibility guidelines um I think what we might do here is um I mean we have done a workshop on this if we can discuss both of them at the same time that's probably easiest and I'm not sure there'd be any additional questions are there any additional questions from anyone on these no one if that's okay so just in terms of the recommendation where it says approve a continuation of the carryover provision for unallocated uh heritage incentive grants so does that mean that the 1.5 have got on budget now if that's not spent next year wouldn't theory be three million oh no we that isn't allocated this year would roll over to the next financial year the balance not additional 1.5 million there is no current 1.5 million in the next year yeah okay so it's just carrying it forward yep perfect cool yeah okay no questions on either um of those two papers right do I have a mover for um item 11 jimmy and andrew seconding um any debate I'll put that all in oh andrew sorry thank you and just very briefly um I welcome the heritage strategy when it was um adopted um and certainly the way that that heritage strategy was put together with the input of um a large number of people from across the heritage community and the wider community was was exemplary it's great to now see adjustments to the funding regime that allow us to better implement that heritage strategy and that reflect the provisions particularly as regards um and I realize this is the the other report and I promise I won't debate the second one as well um that reflect the um movable and intangible heritage so that really works for the sitting um and now a funding regime that's um perfectly aligned with that strategy so um yeah this is a big step forward thank you for the debate in that case I'll put that one all those in favor please say aye any against that's carried thank you very much do I have a mover for item 12 andrew and then mike I know these promise not to debate it so I'm giving him the moving um any debate on this one yeah yes this is very important because recently I've been invited to attend a couple of and having the the kind of activity event that's very very crucial particularly why do the community group and showcase you know the other kind of tvs for us you know actually this also you know is contribute comply with our heritage strategy you know for implementation it's very crucial so we'll be impressed so they're very important so fully support this one thank you very much and with that I'll put the motion all over this thank you very much for all your work on that one thank you thank you see you in the new year you too have a good christmas um sustainability fund welcome tony hello okay so we're likely to have some questions on this but I'll get you to do a brief intro first okay um and then I think the applications that we've got are actually in the px section if people are wanting to discuss those and there were some indications that people did we might move briefly into px to discuss those income back out for the um for the finishing of the discussion and the decision sure thank you very much well we we are I'm thrilled to have the sustainability fund uh offering and supporting community projects looking at our climate change goals so it's uh it's obviously helping to support community projects school projects business projects that are that are aligning with our goals of minimizing emissions but also building resilience supporting resilience so we've got a really great range of projects we we're looking at having the first running round and we're looking to do the next one um well we still need to land exactly when you were available uh later in the year but um towards the end of the financial year anyway and then so we've received a good number of applications not all of them uh um were stunning we had um but in terms of the types of projects we did receive a lot of education projects and so there was obviously a need in head under the heading of climate change to actually really encourage more um awareness and more personal and action on climate change so there's a whole range of projects around around education uh that um that have come through we've also got some around transport and water and biodiversity and food the way that the advice has been provided to you is we've had an evaluation panel and that evaluation panel was made up of council staff from across the organization we also had a number of technical advisors from different parts of the council so transport and in waste and the applications so we've received some detailed information from them uh and we've featured that feed that into the recommendations we're providing to you today I'm happy to answer questions when we about the individual projects any generic questions to start with so one day if there's a general question about the fund and how it's done yet okay so what we oh tim just if you're looking at the whole philosophy of what we're trying to do what group here is actually targeting say an area of our community that's not interested that's not interested and climate change they're just living their life doing their thing we've got issues with their yellow bin etc our green bin so there are a large and I'm presuming a large area in our community that are just living life whether they just are concentrating on feeding the family which is totally um you know with acceptable I'm just wondering trying to because you know you go to events what where the what they are and you're preaching I'm just wondering that's all yes so I mean you are right that if you have an interest in this area you're more likely to be participating in the sorts of activities that are proposed it is hard to reach people who are generally not interested um and I think gen what our approach has been is to work with the willing as best we can and then hopefully grow that as a snowball so so I think some of these projects really do give more motivation and momentum behind the willing but they won't yes I'm not sure this funding you know because of some of the in relation to the uh minimize those waste the later funding from the uh canterbury uh the waste the joint committee you know but this one they also apply I'm not sure whether there's any the grey area great area yes yeah so the intentions that's right so the intention of this fund is to support projects that haven't_''_9823.12 been funded by the council already so we can we can talk about some first port of call for projects to come to we're not we they may have received other support from the community from businesses or from other funds that are available in christchurch and beyond so we the intention of this fund is to support projects that are delivering practical action on the ground okay and um the terms of reference I think you've been that's been circulated for you so you can see the purpose of the fund and the criteria that the fund uses yes um and one of those criteria is to have a tangible benefit obviously this um a legacy really for christchurch but also that it's deliverable and then in the deliverable piece it's really saying do you have the skills and resources uh available for you to carry out this work and that's that's the key um question we're asking when we're looking at the the funding the resourcing they've got okay but the in terms of the overlaps between council funds we try and minimize that through uh having on our uh evaluation panel so he we get a sense of what other funds are being put to community projects and because we if there's a waste project for example we would then go to the waste team and ask them of their perspective on this project but also what funding they've um allocated to projects so we yeah that's it's trying to be holistic and inclusive okay thank you anne and then yani just um when you assess an application do you actually look at whether this work is being done in the communities by other groups so I'm thinking about for example um we've got one of the goals is to enhance ecosystem resilience and nature-based green infrastructure solutions so there are a lot of groups that are doing that work already and that we are funding and I'm also thinking about enviro schools and the work that they are doing um do you assess an application in that light do you use that lens when you when you decide on whether to give a group money or not so the intention is to have what is happening already in the community um the question you've asked around a particular organization doing something already clearly if they if that organization had applied to this fund we could then consider them as part of this bundle but we haven't gone out and shoulder tapped anyone we've said the fund is open we've communicated it to to the christchurch community and we've then received these these applications so um when we're considering the applications themselves we need to take into account the val the value that the proposals is going to give to christchurch but also if there is other uh activities underway that would do the same thing and clearly there are there is a lot of need I suppose in many ways and you mentioned in the biodiversity area you know there's lots of people working in that space so that is that is true there will um but we we've just evaluated what was in front of us what the proposals were and then what were the value how aligned to the purpose of the fund panel and the technical advisors gave us that wider view on what else is going on so in terms of uh the strategic overview of the city you kind of take that into account a little bit like we've been just talking about community facilities we've done a bit of an audit really about what's available in the city and what's being used is that part of the discussion you look at that big picture yeah yeah so that is I suppose it's not a specific criteria in the sense that we we we're not looking at um the applicants aren't being asked to to see to give us information about what is already out there so we're looking at the the applications come on and the merits of the application and then based on our knowledge of what else is happening we can make a decision on that yeah um just wanted to uh stand back because the housing trust has got applications into the fund so for that particular one yeah well but also actually um my general feeling is to a fund giving it to others voting on giving it to others it you know can have an impact or not have an impact so I'll just stand back from the whole report given this to there's two applications in the housing trust so just fine yeah and displace that pauline on the finances I think these add up to just roughly 123 or something so I'm just questioning whatever it is um the total fund is 442. are we likely to see that uh called on this financial year so our expectation is to fully allocate the fund every year uh that you've you've put aside money for this purpose and our intention is to allocate it to projects every year and we have two we have two rounds this financial year so we'll have a second you've got a big chunk of it left but we do have the opportunity uh because when in the terms of reference when this fund was set up to roll over the funds so if it's unspent yeah this furniture if we don will roll over to the following financial year so is it 400 a year yes so obviously there was 23 held over from last year um so that adds to the 400. yes was that 23 held over or was that returned funds when a project didn't happen I think no it was rolled over from it was effectively a commitment yeah yeah for one of the projects that we're going to discuss today okay thank you okay um any further questions that are generic okay so for a couple of specific ones dealing with actual application forms and things I think will um move into px before we come back out again um so so I'm going to move that we move into px for the protection of commercially confidential information on this paper do I have a seconder sam all those in favor any against no that's carried and so back into public and we are on uh mike you're happy to move ahead okay four or five okay so mike's moved this but with g at four I'll foreshadow an okay five it is okay so as is first okay and jimmy's seconding uh and I would like to amend the amount that's going to food bank air terror in new zealand to um 50 000 from 20. okay that's an amendment that ends putting yep okay and philly can I give a reason why are you going to do an amendment as well I'm just trying to line up right now me yeah you're good okay so what's yours I'm still supporting that amendment sorry no no phil's got his own okay I'll swap committees if you if you can right phil I've got I'd like to see us give a thousand bucks to the um that place enter into the river please for it's led lighting what letter what is it what is it it's not on that lever it's in there okay it's in there okay so it's on the matrix that's a okay so 100 percent increase no we don't haven't got second disney okay and anne've requested 450 on fills 405 sorry and um so we're unable to ask give them more money than they've asked for oh yeah give them what they want yeah okay so anne's one first and has an amendment um to take food bank to 50 000 from 20. um do you have a second aim I hope so not at this stage can I can I given a reason why I'd like people to support it or not you don't have a second amendment so not at this point well I want to convince so you have an amendment seconded by james to 405 dollars is that right okay for little river place centre for their one okay so if we could add that up into the um okay so that's an amendment but if the mover and the second are so mike and jim are you happy with the 405 being included rather than an amendment okay that's great so it's just included in the resolutions and no need to do that one separately I know any further changes do we have any debate on these and I would like to debate um my reasoning for wanting to give more money to the food being a tear love food waste contributes hugely to um the release of methane into the community into the environment which is more deadly and more potent in co2 and wasting food is not just about that but it's also it wastes the energy and the water and it that's gone into producing and growing it so it's wasted food waste at aurora rescues food that doesn't go so it doesn't go to landfill and it gives it to people who need it so in terms of sustainability this is a fantastic model for what we want to achieve in our city so they've got a fantastic operation going they've delivered they've re reused 1332.7 tons of food you know kept that from landfill and as well as benefiting many many families so rather than give small amounts of money to groups who are perhaps starting out and you know wanting to achieve the same thing wouldn happening here and give more money to those that have running a very successful operation an award-winning operation they got business of social enterprise of the year I think something like that a couple of years ago for the new zealand business awards they're fantastic and they do a great job so I would have loved for them to have got some more money but however I didn't get a second or so not able to but what we see here is obviously going to achieve sustainability so I'll be supporting what we have available here available for them thanks anton um thank you um I'll be supporting this I have a couple of concerns though one is that um when we have people coming to us with a great idea about sustainability but there are other things in the universe that are doing the same thing or close to rather than creating something new to improve what's already there and working together as a team rather than in silos and then coming back later on all in the name of sustainability which is ironic a concern about that I also have a concern about some of the major education organizations such as universities which a hundred million dollar plus organizations and budgets etc who um seem to come for a few peanuts that these organizations that should be leading this an absolute cutting edge that should be a lot more than this and be a lot more work with this organization so there are a couple of concerns but um I will be supporting this because when you look up there and you see some really small things that are absolutely essential and start to learn like red bikes and the little river lights when those young people start seeing what can be done that's really what it's all about and at the other end the big end we seem to get a bit blunt and we shouldn't be thanks tom anything further no in that case in that case um all those in favor please say aye any against just like that carried um and just before we yeah just before just before we close um we'll get you and this is um from um you you
And so back into public and we are on at mike you're happy to move on okay jimmy yeah four or five okay so mike's moved this but with g at four I'll foreshadow an amendment that g goes to five okay five it is okay so as is okay and jimmy's seconding uh anne I would like to amend the amount that's going to food bank aotearoa in new zealand to 50 thousand from twenty okay that's an amendment that ends putting yeah okay and philly can I give a reason why put in hang on a sec but are you going to do an amendment as well I'm just trying to line up right now me yeah you couldn't amend it yes okay so what's yours I'm still supporting that amendment sorry no no it feels good I don't like putting them in okay so 100 increases we're unable to give to more than they've asked for so they've requested 450 ah on fills 405 sorry and um so we're unable to ask sorry yeah okay so ends one person has an amendment um to take food bank to fifty thousand from twenty um do you have a second and I hope so not at this stage can I can I given a reason why I'd like people to support it or not you don't have a second amendment so not at this point I want to convince someone to fill so you have an amendment seconded by james to 405 is that right okay for little river place centre for their one okay so if we could add that up into the um okay so that's an amendment but it's a mover and a seconder so mike and jimmy are you happy with the 405 dollars being included rather than an amendment okay that's great so it's just included in the resolutions and no need to do that one separately I know any further changes no so we have a mover and a seconder do we have any debate on these and I would like to debate um my reasoning for wanting to give more money contributes hugely to the release of methane into the community into the environment which is more deadly and more potent in co2 and wasting food is not just about that but it's also it wastes the energy and the water and it's gone into producing and growing it so it's wasted food waste at aurora uh rescues food that doesn't go so it doesn't go to landfill and it gives it to people who need it so in terms of sustainability this is a fantastic model um for what we want to achieve in our city um so they've got a fantastic operation going they've delivered they've reused 1332.7 tons of food you know kept that from landfill and as well as benefiting many many families so rather than give um small amounts of money to groups who are perhaps starting out and you know wanting to achieve the same thing wouldn't it be great to actually strengthen what's already happening here and give more money to those that are running a very successful operation an award-winning operation they got like that a couple of years ago for the new zealand business awards they are fantastic and they do a great job so I would have loved for them to have got some more money but however I didn't get a second or so not able to but what we see here is obviously going to achieve sustainability so I'll be supporting what we have available here available for them thanks anton um thank you um I'll be supporting this I have a couple of concerns though one is that um when we have people coming to us with a great idea about sustainability but there are other things in the universe that are doing the same thing or close to rather than creating something new to improve what's already there and working together as a team rather than in silos and then coming back later on all in the name of sustainability which is ironic really isn't it you know so I do have a concern about that I also have a concern about some of the major education organizations such as universities which um seem to come for a few peanuts that these organizations that should be leading this an absolute cutting edge that should be a lot more than this and be a lot more work with this organisation so there are a couple of concerns but um I will be supporting this because when you look up there and you see some really small things that are absolutely essential and start to learn like red bikes and the little river lights when those young people start seeing what can be done that's really what it's all about and at the other end the big end we seem to get a bit blunt and we shouldn't be thanks tom anything further all right in that case just from the one yeah in that case um all those in favor please say aye any against just like that carried um and just before we yeah just before just before we close um we'll get you know we'll get um and to close the karakia and this is um the karakia from um
Forms and things I think we'll move into px before we come back out again um so so I'm going to move that we move into px for the protection of commercially confidential information on this paper do I have a secondary sam all those in favor any against no that's carried you
Thank you thank you see you in the new year you too have a good christmas um sustainability fund welcome tony hello okay so we're likely to have some questions on this but I'll get you to do a brief intro first okay um and then I think the applications that we've got are actually in the px section if people are wanting to discuss those and there were some indications that people did we might move briefly into px to discuss those then come back out for the um for the finishing of the discussion and the decision sure thank you very much well we we are I'm thrilled to have the sustainability fund uh offering supporting uh community projects looking at our climate change goals so it's uh it's obviously helping to support community projects school projects business projects that are that are aligning with our goals of minimizing emissions but also building resilience supporting resilience so we've got a really great range of projects we we're looking at having two funding rounds um so we've just this is the next one um well we still need to land exactly when you're available later in the year but um towards the end of the financial year anyway and then um so we've received a good number of applications not all of them uh um were stunning we had um but in terms of the types of projects we did receive a lot of education projects and so there was obviously a need and hid in under the heading of climate change to actually really encourage more um awareness and more personal and action on climate change so there's a whole range of projects around education that um that have come through we've also got some around transport and water and biodiversity and food the way that the advice has been provided to you is we've had an evaluation panel and that evaluation panel was made up of council staff from across the organization we also had a number of technical advisors from different parts of the council so transport and waste and the parks unit gave us technical advice around some of the applications and we've featured that feed that into the recommendations we're providing to you today I'm happy to answer questions when we when about the individual projects any generic questions to start with so one day if there's a general question about the fund and how it's done yet so what we oh tim just if you're looking at the whole philosophy of what we're trying to do what group here is actually targeting say an area of our community that's not interested it's not interested and climate change they're just living their life doing their thing we've got issues with our yellow bin etc our green bin so there are a large and I'm presuming a large area in our community that are just living life whether they just are concentrating on feeding the family which is totally um you know with acceptable I'm just wondering trying to because you know you go to events what whether what they are and you're preaching to the converted and you're getting better ideas so I'm just right that if you have an interest in this area you're more likely to be participating in the sorts of activities that are proposed it is hard to reach people who are generally not interested um and I think gen what our approach has been is to work with the willing as best we can and then hopefully grow that as a snowball so so I think some of these projects really do give more motivation and momentum behind uh the willing um but they won't yeah I I'm not I'm not sure this funding you know because of some of the in relation to the uh minimize those waste their prior funding from the uh canterbury uh the waste joint committee you know but this one they also apply I'm I'm not sure whether there's any the grey area grey area yes yes so the intentions that's right so the intention of this fund is to support projects that haven't_''_277.52 been funded by the council already so we can we can talk about some details around that but also that to come to we're not we they may have received other support from the community from businesses or from other funds that are available in christchurch and beyond so we the intention of this fund is to support projects that are delivering practical action on the ground okay and the terms of reference I think you've been that's been circulated for you so you can see the purpose of the fund and the criteria that the the fund uses yes and one of those criteria is to have a tangible benefit obviously this um a legacy really for christchurch but also that it's deliverable and in the deliverable piece it's really saying do you have the skills and resources uh available for you to carry out this work and that's that's the key um question we're asking when we're looking at the the funding the resourcing they've got okay but the in terms of the overlaps between council funds we try and minimize that through uh having on our uh evaluation panel yes the strengthening communities fund fund manager as funds are being put to community projects and because we if there's a waste project for example we would then go to the the waste team and ask them of their perspective on this project but also what funding they've allocated to projects so we yeah that's it's trying to be holistic and inclusive okay thank you anne when you assess an application do you actually look at whether this work is being done in the communities by other groups so I'm thinking about for example um we've got one of the goals is to enhance ecosystem resilience and nature-based green infrastructure solutions so there are a lot of groups that are doing that work already that we are funding and I'm also thinking about enviro schools and the work that they are doing um do you assess an application in that light do you use that lens when you when you decide on whether to give a group money or not so the intention is to have a uh the evaluation panel to have a good view of what is happening already particular organization doing something already um clearly if they if that organization had applied to this fund we could then consider them as part of this bundle but we haven't gone out and shoulder tapped anyone we've said the fund is open we've communicated it to to the christchurch community and we've then received these these applications so um when we're considering the applications themselves we need to take into account the va the value that the proposals is going to give to christchurch but also if there is other activities underway that that would do the same thing and clearly there are there is a lot of need I suppose in many ways and you mentioned in the biodiversity area you know there's lots of people working in that space so that is that is true there will um but we we've just evaluated what was in front of us what the proposals were and then what were the value how aligned to the purpose of the fund and how it aligned to the criteria and then the evaluation panel and the is going on so in terms of the strategic overview of the city you kind of take that into account with it like we've been talking about community facilities we've done a bit of an audit really about what's available in the city and what's being used is that part of the discussion you look at that big picture yeah yeah um so that that is I suppose it's not a specific criteria in the sense that we we're not looking at um the applicants aren't being asked to to see to give us information about what is already out there so we're looking at the the applications come on and the merits of the application and then based on our knowledge of what else is happening we they can make a decision on that yeah thank you all right yanny I just um just wanted to uh stand back because the housing trust has got applications into the fund so for that particular one yeah well but also actually um my general feeling is that if a group that you're voting on giving it to others you know can have an impact or not have an impact so I'll just stand back from the whole report given this too there's two applications in for the housing trust so I just want this time yeah and just close that yeah pauline put one on the on the finances I think these add up to just roughly 123 or something is it I'm just questioning whatever it is um the total fund is 442. are we likely to see that called on this financial year so our expectation is to fully allocate the fund every year that you've you've put aside money for this purpose and our intention is to allocate it to projects every year and we have two we have two rounds this financial year so you've got a big chunk of it left but we do have the opportunity uh because when in the terms of reference when this fund is set up to roll over the funds so if it's unspent yeah this furniture if we don't find projects that the following financial year so is it 400 a year yes so obviously there was 23 held over from last year um so that adds to the 400. yes was that 23 held over or was that returned funds when a project didn't happen I think no it was rolled over from it was effectively a commitment yeah yeah for one of the projects that we're going to discuss today okay thank you okay um any further questions that are generic okay so for a couple of specific ones with actual application forms and things I think we'll um move into px before we come back out again so so I'm going to move that we move into px for the protection of commercially confidential information on this paper
It's carried thank you very much do I have a mover for item 12 andrew and then mike I know these promise not to debate it so I'm giving him the moving um any debate on this one yes this is very important because recently I've been invited to attend a couple of incentives have the the kind of activity event that's very very crucial particularly why do the the community group and showcase you know the other kind of tvs for us you know actually this also you know is contribute comply with our heritage the strategy you know for implementation that's very crucial so very impressive so they're very important so for this apartment thank you very much and with that I'll put the motion all over this in favor please say aye any against declare that carried thank you very much for all your work on that one thank you thank you see you in the new year you too have a good christmas um sustainability fund
Heritage incentive grant funding updates to eligibility guidelines I think what we might do here is um I mean we have done a workshop on this if we can discuss both of them at the same time that's probably easiest and I'm not sure there'll be any additional questions are there any additional questions from anyone on these no one if that's okay so just in terms of the recommendation where it says approve a continuation of the carryover provision for unallocated uh heritage incentive grants so does that mean that the 1.5 has got on budget now if that's not spent next year it wouldn't theory be three million oh no it we've got that 1.5 million any of that 1.5 million that isn't allocated this year would roll over to the next financial year the balance not additional 1.5 million there is no current 1.5 million in the next year yeah okay so it's just carrying it forward into it yep perfect cool yeah okay no questions on either of those two papers right do I have a mover'll put that all oh andrew sorry thank you and just very briefly um I welcome the heritage strategy when it was adopted and certainly the way that that heritage strategy was put together with the input of a large number of people from across the heritage community and the wider community was was exemplary it's great to now see adjustments to the funding regime that allow us to better implement that heritage strategy and that reflect the provisions particularly as regards and I realize this is the the other report and I promise I won't debate the second one as well um that reflect the um movable and intangible heritage so I think what we've got to is a strategy that really works for the sitting and now a funding regime that's perfectly aligned with that strategy so um yeah this is a big step forward thank you any for the debate in that case I'll put that one all those in favor please say aye any against that's carried thank you very much do I have a mover for item 12 andrew it so I'm giving
Okay so we're next moving to the discretionary response fund so that's you again sam yeah and I've come to join him that's required welcome gary so gary's been a long time no see fair has been very involved in the harpai with the high power organization so he'll answer questions related to the specific application excellent I'll take it as read um is there anything you need to add no any questions do I have a mover and in second of melanie is there any debate no in that case I'll put that all in favor please say aye any against carried just like that nice to see you gary yeah yeah merry christmas um
To the community loan scheme so we have sam come and talk to that and sam you were looking at moving the recommendation with a different question that's what everyone says good morning okay I'll take it as red and sam's got a question cool um thanks sam so just on this uh you've talked about the ability for the club to repay yes you've obviously taken quite a conservative approach I've had some correspondence with them sort of in the last 24 hours where they've talked about the approach they've taken is quite conservative as well so let's see the the 40 grand loan will basically minimize I guess their reserves um but at the same time if they would if they were able to have a slightly a bit more um there'll be additional savings for them which means they might be able to repack quicker do you guys have a view on the sort of conservative approach that was taken or to our assessment yeah yeah sure I think it explains in the matrix kind of where on that which was that they have cash flow sorry for the massive papers they've got kind of annual estimated cash flow from the previous few years of financial statements um of around about seven thousand dollars and the repayments on the 40k loan is about five and a half so we're leaving them a little bit of buffer there so as you say an increase from 40 to say 50 000 would give them a bit more of a buffer in this project and some comfort if they don't need that I'm sure they'd be happy to repay earlier and that would work if they did need it then it would put a little bit more financial pressure over the next few years as they repay but not beyond what's conceivable for them so what would be the like in your I guess professional assessment the maximum you would go to so there's a recommendation there but what would the level of comfort be from the organization in terms of how high if we were to change that number it could go was this the spot that we felt would not put them under a burden that they couldn't handle uh and and be enough for them to successfully complete their project but I i I wouldn't want to go higher than 50 there's a staff recommendation yep okay because they have had that hundred thousand dollar loan in the past they have yeah they've got a good track record a stable club yeah okay well look can I just signal then that I'm happy to move that subject to changing it to 50 000. you can move 50. and tim's happy a second now any um if it was 50 000 would that be over eight years uh that's as it stands at the moment yeah if it was fifty thousand would it be over eight years rather than say ten 10. okay so 50 just sorry just to answer in more detail I've been looking at my spreadsheet trying to do that while answering to to increase it to 50 000 over eight years would increase their annual repayment on the loan their annual kind of cash flow reserves are so it's on that border line yeah that's fine because I mean the the correspondence I've had with them is that there's additional sources of revenue that they can invest in that other squash clubs in the lake are using so yeah they seem pretty comfortable with it the extra ten thousand would they allow them to do something else to the building that would allow them to get extra income yeah there's two different aspects which will get them a couple of thousand more a year so okay yeah okay um nelly do you think sam it might be better to make it over ten years uh what do you think I'm comfortable with right okay I mean we've seen with other loans if it becomes an issue council has been pretty approachable around resetting terms etc and if future councils are of the same mind then then it wouldn't be an issue but to help these orgs not be burdened with debt forever it's good to you know try and push questions no any damage just smooth spine seconded by tim and sam yeah just really briefly I mean to me this is a really good example of how the council can enable the community so and this virtually provides no cost to the ratepayer there's you know an interest which is higher than what we borrow it for which enables them to partner with the burnside rugby club and to you know really get some tangible assets on effectively land that's ours um they've got a really proven track record and as you'll know I'm relatively conservative with this stuff but the fact that I'm asking for an additional 10 grand on their behalf should give you some comfort that I don't think they're going to show up not being able to pay it back um so I'd be really grateful for everyone can support it thanks sam um anyone else no in that case I'll put that all in favor please say aye any against declare that carried okay so next moving to the discretionary
 uh no I mean we've spoken quite extensively and talked about the climate change strategy this is really just to confirm that we're now um intending to go out for public consultation in parallel with the ltp and also the recommendation that we set up a working group of elected members are there any questions uh mike fignani so just just quickly um so so there's no risk of this not being ready to go out for consultation confident that it'll be already it will be all ready we're well down the track um with the development we've got a really like a close to a final draft which we met with um sarah recently and we're just making some incorporating some final feedback and then we'll share that with councillors next year early next year I think and the other one um 5.17 on page 56 that says following counsellor feedback staff will also consider opportunities for further stakeholders so will you do it in august uh we've had some discussions um we don't intend to do any maintaining contact with our we call it the technical advisory group but there's good membership of that across youth academia unions representation the chamber of commerce so we are keeping them informed and following the last briefing we've asked for their feedback on some of the modelling work so we will yeah continue to engage through our networks rather than any other formal engagement okay thank you thanks johnny yeah thanks um I was just saying in the report um under five points sorry just um it's just on the finance seven sorry 7.1 to implement um improved the cost of establishing the working group where we met from existing budgets um expected to be low and would be met with an existing budget funding source existing operational budgets but given how much pressure we've had on our budgets can you at least give us some sense of what the cost anticipated will be so the cost of the working group would effectively be staff time so there's no other additional cost of establishing a working group so to speak that this doesn't include additional work for other policies and things as part of this yeah I know about what's particular you know we've just been told that we've got to reduce the number of meetings we've got other parts of the organization telling us that we don't have resourcing capacity to get stuff done we're now doing something new but we don't have any sense of the financial cost but also also actually um what other things may get deferred if we agree I mean I'm not against it but I just think we should have visibility about how this can actually be delivered in our current financial situation because yeah so staff have given us advice that it is able to be done within current budgets imagine if there's anything that will be bumped to be able to do this no we wouldn't envisage that I mean it's it is staff time but we are spending that time um already really um in our you know liaison preparation for presenting to this committee and council so it will just be um and elected members to get together so it won't have any impact on other work so things like the grey water sustainability of you know water supply which I'm told we can't we don't have resources to do that's not going to things like that are not going to impact on strategy and planning that's not going to get delayed more because they're different staff are they is it which staff is that strategy in plenty um yeah so this is in um the strategic policy team so the natural environment team so it would be myself um and members from the policy team and natural staff team yeah so cool um just yeah the only other thing I wanted to check is like um this is really good and it's really important and I'm just concerned that a number of council-controlled organizations and companies are doing their own thing is there any ability to come up with a joint strategy across our council companies around how we respond to climate change so that we I guess we seem to be other or um having a more consistent approach I'm just mindful of the deputations we heard um last week from certain people um groups that are mentioned in here around their concern at what was going on and it did seem a bit disconnected so I just wondered if if there's any thought to what we can do to get a more joint up approach with our council organisations and companies I mean we absolutely recognise that we are going to need to do this in partnership with the community and as well as our other ccho companies I think they're uh we've shared the strategy with them um and they've participated in workshops and have input into that so I think um there will always be um tensions in terms of some of the competing kind of priorities um but that is just something we will need to tackle as part of addressing climate change one I think there's really good opportunities so we are talking with orion and we see that some of the work that they are doing around measurement and sharing expertise um and working closely with those companies but now we have this uh no so the um the consultation will go out in parallel with the ltp and we will hear the submissions we still need to work out with the hearings team exactly how that will form the working group is separate to that we would like to get a working group set up and established so that we can get that input and ideas as we develop the strategy and on some of the current work that we are doing so the working group is intended to um yeah sort of oversee and have oversight of the implementation of the climate change strategy so it's more than just hearing the submissions we'll have a hearings panel we just need to talk yes yes absolutely so we just need to speak with megan pearce about how that will fit in but yes there will be a hearings panel to hear the submissions on the strategy no we will come back when we present the final draft strategy for approval we'll then provide some more are there any further questions if not do I have a mover for the report mike and jimmy okay is there any debate no I don't yeah thank you I think that um just the consultation with the communities is really important because we've got to take everybody with us and if we don't take the community with us and it becomes a council climate um then that's kind of going to miss the point so um yeah I think it's really good thank you very much for the work you've done thank you I would like to oh sorry sorry yeah it's wider than those kind of working group and through all the all the regular and formal consultation policies so we look forward to this document leading us to fully the compliance with our information on climate change emergency declaration thank you all right thank you very much and with that I will put it all in favor please say aye any against uh that carried katie and emma thank you so much for your work on this thank you and now he moved to the community loan scheme
Which is exciting and now we move to the community facilities network plan so welcome john paul sylvia is not george and ringo unfortunately no welcome everyone um so uh we've had the the two reputations today based on us as well as the the engagement um based on the uh reputations we've had today is there anything further that you would look at changing um on that based on that engagement look thank you uh thank you sarah the uh the uh this committee saw the uh the draft plan and the uh proposed consultative process back in july august and we've been out and engaged extensively you can see we've got a wide range of feedback and the the the council report itself and supporting information details how that feedback has been taken on in particular we have uh listened intently and softened the requirement or perceived requirement for facilities to be always developed in partnership we're now very very clear that uh look that's a preference however uh if there are circumstances where there's just not appropriate council will continue uh in the plan the yet it's also been further strengthened in the recommendation that we'd uh like you to consider I would like to give some reassurance to uh joe gould over the rigour and the inclusiveness of a feasibility and a business plan stage to inform the community board on decision-making on community facilities but I would like to re-emphasize the value that we place around community boards as being the decision-makers they are elected and they are closest to their communities of interest and we find that with these locally based facilities the uh they uh uh do provide the best decision-making forum to answer your question sarah and sorry I've taken some time I would like to re-emphasize the uh the second recommendation we're noting that the implementation of this plan will come back to this committee uh in a year's time and I'd probably like to strengthen that recommendation because if there are any changes in the environment changes in facilities changes in the nature of communities of need that are need to be reported and reflected that is what we've heard uh uh uh kind of strengthens that lastly I'd like to say that uh uh graeme spinks the uh we've actually spent some time of yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening with our colleagues at recreation sports and events uh david bailey the the managers I've been have a talk to graham we do think uh that there is uh that there is work that we can do together to uh assist our graham and martial arts and uh if it has taken this community consultation to bring parties closer together well it wasn't expected it wasn't completely in the scope of the plan but I'm very very glad it's happened and the uh we do have capacity to be able to help martial arts they will be treated as community customers at community rates and uh look I think only good can happen from that and we would probably like to invite uh you know graham to come back in a later stage and let us know how things have gone great and just before we get to um note to make sure that we get an update on the um the the um sports network plan as well facilities yeah very much so so we've got um pauline mike jimmy and tim yeah um john my questions regarding um finance and running the cost of running the centers yeah so you've got a council run centre where council pays for everything they'll pay for the staffing they'll pay for the bookings they'll pay maintenance etc then if you go the other end which is what we're wanting is the community running it uh getting enough bookings to make itself sufficient etc now not all community facilities are the same you can go from one room facilities which have a very limited opportunity to raise funds to run the thing or a multi-room thing which the tenchuti road was very good at that and it was stood on its own feet um there must be a hybrid in the middle where we share some costs and that kind of thing hasn't really been addressed in the plan so unless I've missed is a there is that there's certainly hybrid there are a couple of examples there are at least five models there of how the council and the community work together the uh uh going from council doing everything to council maybe providing a loan and communities get on with it within each of our uh leases and different arrangements with community groups operating facilities there are different levels of council contribution and this is current practice the so council will play to its strengths and fund where it's most appropriate we will fund structure building structure will fund external maintenance compliance insurance electrical plumbing gas the where communities are able to and where they can through volunteers or fundraising uh look after the internal maybe paint the wall our internal walls cover power cover our cleaning costs because they're better placed to do so through volunteers or community deals we do that so we currently have a a very flexible system of uh of that we also offer community funding uh it's emphasized strongly in the plan that our intent is not to let partner organizations think if you were to talk to some of the more recent examples let's say uh project littleton and the littleton center trust the there's a prime example of us really doing that we set these things up to succeed yep if they're not will come so what you're saying is that any um hybrid model let's call it there um is sorted out at the time of signing a lease absolutely yeah um yeah and more recently if partner organizations are unwilling to go into a lease with the higher level uh obligations we have what's called an access agreement where we simplify markedly all sides are very very clear on their obligations and we play to our strengths right thank you that's really good answer I appreciate it thank you mike thank you um I know it's in in the um plan and this seemed to be a theme for a number of feedback too around the city-wide there are currently no significant major geographical gaps in the the network of all council and non-council-owned_._472.56 facilities are considered not too of the best feedbacks I read was actually from the uahuru spreading kashmir community board sorry where they actually said you know that the data's not there to show actually the cost of these community facilities to people and actually if you start to look at that potentially there will be significant gaps for people that can't actually afford to use many of these facilities so I just don't think the wording in this yeah right yeah in terms of actually this no gap then yeah mike the uh the wording is carefully chosen and that the there are no significant significant geographical gaps but we we do say uh in a number of areas however look at the uh the north and look at the southwest they look at the north first and then the southwest because geographically that's where you know we're either just upon a gap or a gap is going to come pretty quickly with the infill housing development secondly and most significantly the plan does explicitly say are new developments changes are likely to be driven by changes in community center as an example of that so but the uh the scenario that you've envisaged and that was raised by uh uh sprayed and kashmir are areas that uh are are experiencing uh the withdrawal of other facilities or financial pressures or groups falling over those are the sorts of community needs the changes in demographic which will trigger the need to look at new or changed facilities and if we haven't made that explicitly clear we can certainly strengthen that wording yeah it's just to me when I look at it we don't know if there's gaps because we don't actually know the cost to the communities to hire all these buildings and actually if we knew that then it may suddenly say actually these buildings aren't accessible to a number of people in the community then suddenly there is a gap already in existence in this community so to me it's just a little bit too generic I guess and it's not really saying what the true um situation is for certain communities probably one more response to that is there a change that you'd like or additional information based on that or you're just expressing a concern because it talks about it specifies geographic and your concerns about access to those ones in the geographic spaces is that right so reject some more information included on okay thanks yeah john we're going to add to that no no the just uh just uh to note that under the implementation plan one of the uh actions is to collect more information on facilities that council doesn't own the so when I referred earlier to uh reporting back to the community years time on the implementation plan we would aim to have uh filled a lot of that uh gap of information to allow better decision making it's just part of the process we're not in a position to report it now when it comes to community facilities that are council owned that's something that when it comes to affordability we're in charge of for fees and charges okay thanks um jimmy and then tim then end in mel like last foreign least they can build up their own facility all they can you know long-term kind of permanently can you know to lease a council on the facility that's permanent not just just one or two times long term once a week they can continue use I don't know how to meet these needs yes sorry I don't understand the question so jeremy are you imagining this because of the kind of center a moment right here yeah but based on how the multicultural so jimmy when it comes to the plan this plan um are there concerns that you've got with this plan does it not say because it talks about communities that need and and says that we will help communities that need their needs but for those communities to go to the community boards or to those areas and council to assist them to facilitate the facilities this yeah john do you have anything to add there yes yes yes I do the firstly we the council still has a uh 17 19 facilities for hire 17. 17 facilities for hire are around the from all areas of the community the reason that we choose to hire a number of these facilities is to make sure that they're accessible secondly we've got a multicultural committee and staff working on implementing a multicultural strategy which includes reaching out to different communities and assisting them directly thirdly we've got community development staff working with community boards in each area of town and from time to time the issues come up and we provide solutions probably lastly we have funding relationships with a large amount of ethnically diverse community organizations in order to provide access to facilities for events and other activities that sort of allow us to increase the celebration of cultural diversity in the city so there are a number of mechanisms probably outside the scope of this plan which is largely you know uh facility based thank you tim um thank you john um go follow on from what I'm graham brought and went in the old days you know I used to turn up and you'd be able to put the bags and things for boxing or whatever'd have to like the old stage in the hall you'd have your area yeah and a lot of the stuff was you know your gloves and stuff were personal with our new um facilities that we've built what's do we take that type of thing into account because it'd be hard to say lease a building to one organization to try and minimize the cost of running it is it on the right track or yeah a couple a couple of things from uh from my experience the uh the martial arts uh they need mats the uh some facilities when the martial arts use is not sort of predominant it's not huge we will have spaces that the mats can be stored and then moved out and you can have your session and move back again the more that facility is used for the activity and the higher level of that activity the less convenient it is to move these things in and out if the facility gets too specialist the value of the equipment and the time taken and the safety implications so the issue will be as the activity grows a question with us is you'll reach the point where you probably need exclusive use of that facility and in certain facilities yes that's absolutely fine in other facilities when those agreements come before community boards who are the deciders they will weigh up the public interest in having a range of access to that facility or the public interest in really serving a community like the martial arts community well and and having it a lot more dedicated to that facility so with what's so rather than having it dedicated to say judo which needs the mats a lot of them need the hanging points for the so would there be an opportunity to look at a facility and say cross lease to a number of martial arts or boxing would it cross and that would be a discussion that we would have probably led by david bailey in rec sports and events and it's uh yeah the once you start getting into a specialization like that it moves out of the general purpose community facility talking with david last night they do have capacity and they do have facilities and it might be a very very useful conversation with graham and other members of the martial arts community they might get a lot of benefit out of this morning tell you the truth that's great thank you and then mel yeah kiara thank you it's incredibly complex always you've got so multi-layers of stuff to think about and organize so a couple of questions following on from um joanna's point about uh elected members change and the knowledge of the community um changes with that how are you thinking that that knowledge will continue and be yeah yeah very good question yeah the uh a number of things have improved we now have a far superior very comprehensive asset management plan uh uh in place the uh the latest iteration that we included uh was uh july we're just about to sign off a december an awful lot of the this institutional information is captured in that plan it's in trim it's our records it's kept up that this exercise has allowed us to do is build up the first ever big picture of facilities their properties their capabilities in and around town and of course we're not there yet we've started we aim to work with our smart cities people to have a really good interactive map where you can a member of the public can ping onto a facility it may be ours it may be a partner organizations to say this is the uh huntsbury hall it's available for hire xyz it's dimensions of this its price is this it's an improvement task in the plan the should you guys uh uh uh approve the plan today and we would aim to report back to this committee in a year's time to let you know how we've uh uh how we've got on and essentially it's a wee bit of an extension to what uh mike was saying councillor davidson earlier on the uh uh mikes were more questions were more how can you inform planning how can you identify areas of need your question where do we keep this information so there's there's two fast sources of truth that uh truth wrong word but uh two fast sources of information that we were considering that's fantastic and I think um giving that information regularly to maybe even annually to the community board so what's what's just reminding and up and great that you're talking about smart cities and using that because that was my question whether you could do that because it's a fantastic place for people to get information and if they could just push on and say you know what do I need and when is it available how much is it going to cost the cost thing is is interesting obviously it's a barrier any thoughts about how we could make it more equitable in terms of the sort of things that graham was talking about the the costs for the cost for council facilities are in councillors control and they discuss it annually the uh generally speaking partnership agreements the if we have a lease it is at a peppercorn the uh divided between the council contribution as I said and the uh the operator contribution we always aim for the operator to be able to charge a modest amount to cover their costs so they are sustainable if there's a gap it's community funding or a different lease arrangement and they're bespoke depending on the the nature of the facility new ones with lots of flash things that people want to go to we need less help older ones that are clearly in need of a bit of maintenance the but nevertheless very valuable to the community uh we'll provide more help thank you mel and then yanni um two questions um one um can you comment on what graham was talking about with the change of use like I didn't understand what that was referring to or I think he's got a uh consenting issue I think they're doing a change of use for a building yeah that they currently have it's not a community facility yeah so yeah the second point um was um really what mike talked about before um it was also just basically availability I mean you could have ten community centres in one block but if they're all filled up all the time you can't get in there then there's no availability yeah so um and and I know that staff um responded to that but I really feel like um and I should have said this earlier but I do think um because we do have a sentence in there about facility asset condition and works underway to look at that for council facilities I really think that we should actually have um something in there that says it works underway to assess availability and affordability of council owned facilities to determine significant gaps because you did respond back to say that you would work with community boards to see if there are any gaps but if we're stating a sentence in this plan that says there are no significant geographical gaps so that's a fact it reads as a fact and it may not necessarily be 100 true yeah I mean yeah so are we able to have a sentence you've got I just wrote it down I can email it I think we add it to the add it to the editor we'll go into page resolution and put it formally in the implementation plan yeah are you happy with that yeah yeah cool so if you flick it through to aiden that would be great okay yanny thanks um I was just wondering what assessment we've done of the current community managed facilities governance to assess whether how it's working and whether this is the right approach going forward like have we done any sort of in-depth assessment of the skills of community governance the ability the the strength weaknesses but not a lot because it was outside the scope of the plan when we first looked at the scope of the plan with the antecedent social housing community development committee and subsequently this committee we were reasonably specific about what the plan would cover and what it wouldn't_:_1453.279 and the capacity of community organizations uh as is uh wasn't wasn't included in the scope the uh but look what I investment on an ongoing basis through either civic-based staff such as paul and sylvia and community-based staff located in every single ward who liaise directly with community groups help where they can they try not to impose and sometimes were I said look you know I i keep away we invest considerable sums and things like leadership lab where we are empower and and trained uh local community uh leaders so all these process sites are operative I certainly can't_''_1507.039 say that uh every group is functioning and functioning well but what I can say is there's an awful lot of centers out there that are run incredibly well uh uh they've got uh uh engaged clientele they uh uh you know and from time to time we support them they uh uh we did an exercise uh immediately post covered where we approached about 230 community-based organizations and the feedback was largely yep we're okay but we might need some support and a lot of the feedback was reflected in the advice we provided to uh the committee you convened the uh regarding the uh support mechanisms out there working alongside this plan because the scope of this plan was actually the uh the health of community organizations probably in addition the uh our community development uh team and our strategy and policy team have recently done some work on community capacity and that will be uh shared with boards uh in the in the near future so I'm just trying to like understand if we if we're adopting a sort of high-level principle to have more community-managed facilities but we don't understand in in sufficient detail we haven't done any review of the way in which these facilities have been community run then it feels like a gap so yeah like if I compare it to the board of trustees which I think are emailed around counselors like the ministry of education has done something quite similar looking at schools and how they are governed and managed and it's quite interesting when you read through that the parallels but what we have just heard from john is that that specific stuff was actually outside of the scope of the you set on and that that work is ongoing we have repetitively raised every briefing that we've had at our board and at workshops to the appropriate committee the key question has consistently been raised what review have we done of community managed facilities to identify the challenges that they face so that we can we can learn from it so you can say it's out of scope but it's not through lack of being raised and I just think going forward like if because I get the community development stuff that's probably the easiest part of this the more difficult issue is around things like human resources employment law and and probably the legal aspects of some of these ways in which community management cities we're dealing with the network facilities plan right now we can take that offline and that's fine I'm keeping it through the goal is to give like and we're still talking about increasing community managed council facilities and developing the capacity of the communities to be able to do that at the same time so can the community manager ones have been functioning to review the adequacy or inadequacy of that and look at what's required going forward I mean I i would have thought that's a problem you've given lots of context there that's fine we'll lead to john so can we add it to the implementation plan it's not part of this plan uh an action like that is an awful lot of work and I would want to be able to work with my colleagues identify the scope of an exercise like that and bring it back to this committee so they could talk about this in terms of other organizational priorities before before committing so john we listen it's a really good point have a look at the scope would it be fair to say that if there and I know that there have been cases in the past where there has been some concerns about how a facility is being run or managed or if an organisation is struggling yeah what has happened in that case yeah the uh the the uh uh uh generally yeah generally speaking first of all a conversation's undertaken uh in a discreet way so it's not seen that the council or the community are bowling in and uh muscling or or committing to a predetermined result uh usually there's a conversation how are you going is there anything we can assist with the the conversations usually happen through community development advisors or centrally based staff sometimes we'll ask elected members to uh uh to move in a very successful uh way of doing this is the way we managed uh I think anyway at community-based early learning centers where we did uncover a raft of issues the uh and through gary watson's team were able to produce a a one-stop shop council response which required some funding collaboration with the ministry of development who looked after a lot of the skills-based stuff collaboration with our asset team and we've now got a uh you know a safe and secure network going forward so uh that there are the provisions to do that and uh I probably also like to say that uh going forward we've got three live examples they're all mentioned in the implementation plan there's an albans community center working with a community organization sarah they're independent they're capable they're coming to us uh and we're going to them with ideas on how we play to our strengths and it seems to be going very well the other two examples the opal volunteer library again robust good organization need assistance in certain areas and not in other areas the third one's manuka cottage they are again that they're all going pretty well they uh those are sort of live examples at the moment they uh uh if any organizations are experiencing difficulties we are here to help and we've got the capacity to do that so we'll just wind off this particular one so um yanI's requested some further work be done to look at a whole review of all of our facilities that are that are managed um of course that would only do council facilities and not all the other community ones um do people want it to staff on a case by case maybe to the community boards so if someone raises something that's fine but um do people generally want staff to go away and do this extra bit of work for us or are we just happy to leave it for now andrew I mean I think it's on this particular thing yeah I think it leads to a further question to what extent what we know about the way the community facilities that are run in partnership um to what extent has that influenced what's in um this particular plan and I'm assuming it has if we can be confident that what we know about the the good the bad and the otherwise of the way that we're doing this in partnership with groups already and there are good examples out there and there are good examples out there of where it hasn't worked so well or where there have been some speed wobbles that have come good I think if we can be confident that all of that is um been used to inform what't need any further work to be done thank you okay um so if you know pauline is yours addressing that and is addressing that point of views okay so you're going to see that's on yeah it was on his point yeah because his his issue is something um that isn't a problem in our area but it sounds like um I can think of two in our community board area which have been dealt with they've been raised by either an elected member or a member of the community or the group itself I think just being worked with the staff we've got a couple of live examples in in this in your collective area at the moment that we're working on okay so what I think at the moment is that we um we don't well well there's been an individual concern raised about that but we don't it seems like the meeting generally doesn't need further information on that so we won't take it as an action point but yani I'm happy to chat anything further we can do without um adding to the workload of staff on that particular point at the moment so move on to the next point um pauline thank you um I won't hang on we'll just we'll just go back around again so going back to the affordability issue um it could go the other way potentially where um a community or some organisation is running the centre and their prices go up and they're not affordable so would I know we will have a lease in place but would it also be quite good to construct an mou with anyone that's so that we have an expectation in there that they also um you know on the same page as council and providing a service yeah pauline yeah the very good point the our most recent work in that area uh and I'll uh I'll use the littleton recreation center in their uh activation agreement which is not a lease because they didn't want the the legal implications of the lease there is a clause in there over setting's fees and charges the uh uh and if there is a decision to uh uh to uh change markedly that this is uh discussed with uh community governance staff and if necessary with the community board okay thank you and one last question insurance does council cover insurance for all the facilities we always cover building insurance yep the uh uh we uh invite well we insist that uh organizations uh uh leasing facilities and at times activating facilities get our public liability insurance it's very important they get that for themselves we give really good advice on the level at which they should get and where to go to get the the very best price it's not usually prohibitively expensive but we do take that into account when we're setting lease charges or the amount of services that council will pay for we may do extra maintenance we may do the the grounds if the organization you know would struggle to get public uh uh public waterloo insurance you should get that and we should do the grounds rather than we buy public liability insurance you getting a bit of a work over this morning john I'm just it's been 30 months weeks back today thank you just thinking about future need and growth and um monitor population increases south west and north of the city and advocate for the inclusion of community facilities and wider town planning processes can you explain a bit about that process what that looks like yeah yes I can and again I'll probably refer to to mike's earlier observation there are two areas of town that we've got our eyes on through this plan firstly it's it's the the north between our belfast and sort of preston's area there's a lot of development southwest of the uh so as new properties are being consented as communities are being planned our goal is to talk with our urban planners and our development to keep abreast of the increased population and in the town planning processes where firstly we can secure land and then secondly secure the requirement for a community facility or indeed another another development so it's a joined council-wide basis would probably be led by paul and his team in civic working with local teams but we'd also work with town planning transport and our colleagues and and recreation sport and parks to provide that joined up uh approach maybe community boards could have a bit of an idea in terms of recognizing the need for growth that would be fantastic once we've done the higher work we certainly gave the board the board of the center of all of these community facility decisions yeah thank you very much okay so I'm aware that we've spent a significant amount of time on this already yanI's got another question and mike if you've got any changes that you would admit earlier could you flick those through thanks in response to the submissions I note that there was concern around the working with schools um so I just wondered if we'd considered strengthening anything to do with the ministry of education obviously the shirley boys um the old you know facility that could have been used for community pretty tragic what happened there the moe but we don't seem to have had much progress on that I don't know how other people feel but just listening to the submission this morning particularly around that martial arts it does seem to me that we're missing a huge opportunity to work with the ministry of education yeah and I have to say that we we work with the ministry of education uh uh deeply and regularly and I think gave the last example of over the uh the early learning centers the when say someone like joanna gool talked about stakeholders yeah certainly ministry of education are our stakeholders school groups are are users of our facility and I think you can take you know it's inherently included in the plan that we would work with our schools and education providers we we do that as a matter of course my personal opinion probably doesn't need some strengthening but uh if there's a a desire to have that strength and we'll we'll be happy to do it because we do it anyway yeah I noticed in areas to have buildings and stuff too and same in new brighton but we've got we seem to have a very ad hoc system for working like I don't know if you guys remember when ministry came in with a big map with all the properties that they were looking at and we actually had some quite good conversations to start with but we haven't had that for several years now and also it seems to be all happening ad hoc without any strategic thinking okay so the shirley boys auditorium classic okay so is there a specific wording that you would like changed in the plan or would you like a another discussion on that at another time oh yeah I think it would be good to put it I think it's a fair implementation plan is that we ask for an email year to be signed with the ministry education about how we can make the most out of community facilities you have to have two to sign a agreement so there's only one talking so the opportunity the work that you've said add some wording in there um that you know council staff work with the ministry for education um to make the best use of um community opportunities opportunities something like that yeah okay so with respect I mean staff already said that they felt that didn't need to be strengthened it's already in there and I don't think it does either I think that we're always on the lookout for opportunities like that so there's a there's some wording going in if it's if it's already there it's just it's just repeating something that's already there um and if it moves us on right now I'm sure man why don't you you know regarding implementation until the december of last year report back to the committee because I'm concerned they caused two different uh kind of of the the uh annual plan you know probably start in the june that's for this year financial because while I review 5.4 paraguay first the bully point the last bully point all in relation to the funding for that it caused the two kind of annual plan or long-term plan a moment uncertainty for long-term plan how come to report back I don't know whether maybe june is the best or july is the best time jimmy yes this is only on the implementation this is reporting back on the implementation it's not about funding new facilities it's not about funding for new facilities but because it's in december it will be able to inform the next annual plan yeah yeah yeah yeah I think we might just um try and wind that up now unless there's any I think phil's moving it and sam's second sure sure um yeah so we've got some additional stuff on here okay so if everyone has a we look up on the screen for the wording are people comfortable with that excuse me sarah I'm wondering if we could get it a bit bigger the text it's actually really quite sorry quite difficult to to read big time and I think mike said he sent some wording through to aidan I it may not need to be an amendment though so if sam and phil are happy if yep once it's up resolution it's just an amendment in the document isn't it yeah but then would need to be passed by a recommendation the city-wide map of the distribution of facilities and figures degrees provides an overview of all council and non-council-owned_._2670.64 facilities across the district so it's just taken out of so you're not distinguishing between geographical gaps and then the access to those facilities I'm really sorry for interrupting but I cannot hear anyone who doesn't switch on my apologies mike I just want to replace there's a couple of sentences on page 27 of the agenda refers to the no significant major geographical gap when you look at both community council and community-owned facilities I disagree and a lot of the feedback we received also disagrees with that so I just wanted to change that to show that actually that figure three just provides the overview of all the um council and non-council owned facilities and actually not mention the I think that's subjective okay well what's in what's in it so melanie what's impressive melanie are you happy with that or okay for my point I actually ideally wanted it included within the document because that would sort of have worked with like the similar one to how they're working upon assessing a condition if we see about doing what mike said is fine and then having it in the implementation plan is good yeah I mean john my impression would be that it wouldn't change the guidelines to how we make the decisions no no wouldn't it work it's just it takes out something removed that has got people's yeah yeah the document through you sarah is a decision-making framework yeah that remains entirely intact and uh we we'd be comfortable with that that sentence being removed it wouldn't change anything and I'm wondering if um one a could be amended slightly to include the words um current and future so continue to develop capacity and current uh current and future um in the comm indicators worried about future responsibilities yeah yeah I'm wondering how we after activate activate current and future yeah is that okay does that make sense yeah okay thank you okay so we just need to um are people generally comfortable with mike's amendment so we just need to find it so take it out as an amendment um but copy and put it in so it'd be one d it would come in there because it's a change to the draft these speak actually we've got the wording right before we debated yeah that would be most things okay that's looking good we are at 1102 okay so we have this um wordsmith and formatted and phil would you like to open the debate or would you like to just leave it and close it at the end that's the best two that's the best two-word debate we've had oh you look just very very quick but it's a huge piece of work and thank you very much um and I think that it signifies a dramatic shift actually in the organisations coming up I think the issue with the um the mapping is the fact that we we have included all facilities and some of them are specialists and you might include churches and those so you know what we really need is is enough facilities that are just for residents and run by the community or council but preferably community for the residents we've addressed affordability and accessibility and those two things are very very important um and the way I see this is it's it's a living document I see it as a living document I see it as being containing some flexibility because you know it's not one size fits all and that's the key thing we've got to remember with community facilities and a certain amount of the mapping is actually comparing apples with pears you've got different facilities in different communities you've got facilities that are big and multi-roomed and you know they can apply to lots of different interests in the community and therefore they have an ability to bring in more income and other facilities it's a very broad and diverse piece of work this but as I say to me it's a living flexible document in response to community needs changing communities and I think the driver of these things has to be community boards and the relationship with the community development teams and the council staff all working together with communities to keep an eye on things and I think this is a big step forward so thanks for the amazing amount of work and I'll be supporting this today thanks pauline we've got andrew timmy mel um thank you I'd also like to um acknowledge um all of the work that's gone into this I mean this has taken some time to put together as a plan which is I'm capable of approval today um and the conversations that led to it and that started this piece of work have been going on through various annual plans long-term plans activity plans conversations at community board conversations in the community um for a very long time in fact even since before the time I was elected to see this finally land in a plan um which is in front of us in this way today I do support the softening of the requirement or the perceived requirement for there to be a partnership in place for a community facility to to be developed I think we always need to bear in mind that different communities have got different degrees of capacity capability and willingness to enter into a partnership and often it's those communities where there's greatest need for community facilities where it's least likely that we'll find a community organization which is is able to partner that's not across the board and of course that speaks to another matter that this plan I think reflects quite well which that whilst not only com not all community facilities are the same and paul even made that point very well not all communities are the same so we we cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach we need the flexibility to work with different communities if in different ways according to their capacity capability willingness and so on um and in that regard we different um capacities that council and community community can have in various different relationships and my expectation would be that even though that's well laid out and and sets out opportunities there's plenty of flexibility even within that table at figure four to realize that different facilities different communities will require different approaches some of which we may not have even thought of yet but um now in general um I i welcome this piece of work I think it reflects a direction that we've been wanting to move in for some time and I look forward to seeing seeing it been implemented and getting that report back thank you I thought we'll start the timer for the next ones um so we have tim then melvin um thank you and I thank you to staff for um this is a huge step forward and it's a huge amount of work so thank you um I guess just um the the thing in the back of my mind is when a resident came to us and talked to us about residents coming rather than groups to a facility for all residents rather than just perhaps the the want of a better term the usual suspects and those that are governing those community facilities through and for the council and their communities are open to all residents and we have to ensure that that is the case and also that good connection to our community boards so I think that's the best way forward with that and we've got to ensure that so I'd be really deeply concerned and disappointed if that were not the case so um I think that that's really going to be taken on board and listened to but also with our community facility uh our community board staff as well so yeah I think that's the real key for me too thank you very much no timer required on that one sir thank you uh malviniani then and then jimmy um I mean I think community facilities are very um important especially um probably to community boards because they are local um facilities um I'd like to thank um john and paul for being amenable think um that's very important um community facilities are really important for community building and sometimes the community is there first or they've lost their facility and then we then we build one for them or we help them on that process and it's not easy even if you've got a partner it can take eight to ten years to get a facility back up and running or built again and sometimes there's the opposite where there's an empty building and you're trying to find um you know I've been through the process of trying to find people who will who will run that space and that is a difficult one and it relies on our community development advisors and the support of the board and rallying individuals in the community to get together who don't know each other to um to be able to do something and they can do it but they can't do it alone they need um community governance staff and community board members to be behind there and it can happen so um it really that that some people don't don't necessarily have or believe that they have but they can find it within themselves so um yeah I just think this is really um important for us I think thanks mel um yani um I i think yeah I appreciate the work that's been done on this and I'm happy with about 80 of it but the 20 that I'm really uncomfortable with is the 1v2 which is increasing the number of council-owned facilities operated and activated by community organizations and I know you've put some slightly more wording at the end around appropriate capacity and capability but to me this feels very much like the tomorrow's schools model and I think we really need to look at the assessment of how that's worked or not worked and what's really clear from from that review which I've spent a lot of time reading so there's no evidence to suggest that current self-governing schools model has been successful in raising student achievement or improving equity as was intended and it goes on to say and those with significant additional learning needs remain those most poorly served by the system and the point that is made in that review is that for far too often we put huge governance and statuary responsibility on boards of trustees and I don't think that's unsimilar to the idea that the community should run council-owned facilities it's not to say that there's not a place for it and I support it where it can happen but I don't think we should set an a goal of sort of in a key direction of trying to increase it that should be done when the community wants to do it not us saying this is something that we're going to push you towards which I feel that this part of the strategy does I think what's really important though is that we do have community input and just not having community governance of facilities or community management doesn't mean that you wouldn't have community representation around focusing on the things that are important to that community and again just to stress that the board of trustees review into tomorrow's schools was that people dealing with complex issues like human resource issues employment law technical building maintenance issues often don't have the understanding and the expertise in those fields and can spend a lot of time focusing on that rather than on the key things which is what's important to that community so I strongly disagree with the approach that we're taking around increasing the number of our facilities that we want the community to run I think it will have devastating consequences in parts of the city um and I don't support that direction but the the other final thing I point I wanted to make is that you know people just say that the ministry of education is working well with us as a city I i just can't_''_3587.839 um accept that we we definitely need to improve that relationship what happened and surely we had a perfectly good haul being left vacant for a number of years vandalised at a huge expensive cost to the taxpayer was just an absolute tragedy that should never get some agreement with the ministry of education how we could work with them on the future of facilities in both new schools and the ones that they had vacated and that clearly hasn't worked so I support doing more in that space so I just asked you put the um the resolution separate particularly one b two thanks yani and kia ora and thank you thank you for the work that's been done I know it's been huge um and this is I think all about strengthening the voice of our community boards and and managing and planning for facilities in their local area and so getting that local knowledge is is vital and knowledge is power so I'm really pleased that you're going to be giving information to the community board that will help them to understand what's available in their communities how it's being used and they can use that knowledge to then better equip uh and fulfill the needs of the community so thank you for the work that you've done um we are totally supportive of of it's great thank you thanks ann jimmy okay thank you I just want to remind our first time counselor actually this stuff in response you know to the other uh regular ecology and integrate with all the other cultures multi-ethnic group they make a submission during the annual plan or long-term plan in their time staff you know feedback to the council particular emphasis would like to you know to uh the established community facility network plan so am I right jung I remember it's kind of you know they saw this uh take probably uh two and a half years already but at least you know this is kind of a guiding a document is even is not a kind of standard but at least it is the principle you know we can follow the this principle guideline you know to engage or even work in a partnership with the other community and also this community we are all aware it's not only the geographic community actually it's covered all the demographic immunity so from the community probably have a different uh the request but maximize all those the facility to be the utility you know to fill the gap between the demand from the wider community and from the supply council and some other kind of government agency you know provider et cetera so that's a good beginning but we got the further one I think from now on the the the after the one year that's very very crucial and important or we can take at least one year engage all those kind of the wider community can gather the kind of of the first-hand information so after one year december next year when the staff presented to this community we can gather overall picture and have fun further the maybe um amendment for this kind of plan and for the future the practical needs so I think that's very very crucial so jenny speaking I fully support this plan thanks jimmy mike thank you and I'll be quick um look thanks for the work and obviously this has taken a long time to actually get to this point and you know although the plan obviously has a little a stock take um of where we currently sit in terms of council owned facilities and community owned facilities that's what it is and I think figure 3 highlights actually the amount of facilities there are but we just got to be a little bit careful I guess when we look at that to realize not all facilities created equal and the ability for community groups to access them is limited depending on that group's ability um so I think this is really good it's going to aid in our decision making as we move forward and working out where there are gaps but it's how we actually try and get the data through to actually show where the true gaps are and not where the gaps looked to be thank you um phil would you like to close the debate oh leanne leanne yep the end I wasn't going to contribute to this debate but um I think yanI's comments really have compelled me to do so I i really want to focus on the words appropriate capacity and capability to do so year 2000 and said to them would you like to run the local facility actually they would have said yes back then because it would have been better than the arrangement that was in place with another community group running it um but but in fact uh the the the um the work that went into that community developing a sense of trust and building capacity and capability on the ground has actually enabled that community to find itself in an equivalent position to the to the littleton community which had that capacity um and I think andrew's identified that right from the get-go when the earthquakes happened both communities were in the position to step up and really support their communities in a very upfront and personal way but with incredible capacity and capability and in a disaster we all know that these communities find within themselves they have this capability and and capacity which is why I never like to um refer to the um to to a phrase that suggests that we're giving them something that we're empowering them the power is within that to actually act I think that our facilities are an ideal base for building capacity and capability within communities and so I do want to support this particular part of the motion and I want to pay tribute to the community of arunui I'd like to pay tribute to the community of littleton because they represent the very best of what we can be and what a number of communities across the city would aspire to be if they were given a sense of trust and belief by their local council so I do urge councillors to support the whole resolution thank you um and with that I will I'll put them all together yani but if you'd like to have your um vote recorded against any of those just let us know which ones 1b2 okay so all in favor please say aye any against the whole thing no and just the only record up against 1b2 thank you okay um so we will break now and we will come back in 15 minutes so at 11 35 and we'll see if we can get will be really good thank you
Okay so um presentation of petitions there are none today which is exciting and now we move to the uh community facilities network plan so welcome john paul sylvia is not george and ringo unfortunately no welcome everyone um so
Public forum and that they relate to items actually already on the agenda and so the first of those today will be um joanna gold who's speaking regarding the community facilities network plan so joanna you're aware that this is um you've got 10 minutes um and it's about the the plan itself rather than any individual facility that you might like a decision on at some point good morning members thank you for the opportunity to speak to the community facilities network plan report I don't agree that there are no gaps in this plan I agree with other submitters that this plan does not seem thorough enough I don't agree that the process outlined in question two of the consultation is sufficient to address the residents needs yes community facilities should be community led but not all facilities should involve having a community partner community facilities are a service provided by council to serve the residents in their communities they are not for community partnerships with groups churches or trusts they are for the residents yes community needs must be demonstrated a not consultants local council staff have intellectual property history of the area knowledge of the community and residents needs the feasibility study should be open and transparent eg workshops should include interested residents as well as elected members I do agree that a business case should be done by local council staff and council's role needs to be well established I don't agree that community boards should solely make decisions on community facilities board members are lay people and elections are held every three years how are new board members able to make informed decisions on establishing or disestablishing a community facility I have a number of concerns firstly this plan doesn't take into account the increase in social housing and infill housing in certain suburbs secondly I am concerned that the changes to the district plan have not been considered thoroughly enough especially changes to residential living density zones thirdly it concerns me that developer contributions collected in my area are not being really invested into community facilities in my area thank you for your time thanks so much joanna so it's time for questions you think should have the decision making there I think it needs to be a combined effort for everybody involved that it shouldn't just be solely the task community boards because council staff have a lot of intellectual property they know the areas they are specialists in their um they've trained in those areas so um community board members as I said are just lay people they're not trained specifically to design community centres or understand urban development or the social issues um different communities so when you say everyone who do you mean exactly um council community boards stakeholders and residents it needs to be a combined effort okay thank you okay any other questions so joan at the moment we have a process um whereby if a facility was going to be established or disestablished or those kind of things there would be a proposal put together by those expert staff that then would probably go out for a stakeholder and community consultation and that feedback would come in and then the community will make a decision does that help yeah I don't think think more consultation is done with stakeholders rather than residents and as I said before the community facilities are actually a service for residents and so I think the focus needs to be kind of redirected to what the community community um what the residents actually need rather than who the stakeholder is who the community partnerships are because they're just doing a role um whereas it's they're a service for residents yeah so one of the things we have heard is that there's some concern about that the emphasis on partnerships and trying to get as many partners as possible and that some communities won't have the capacity for that so we do have um some wording to soften that for today okay that's great yeah and so that it talks about helping develop capacity in communities um and that you know we'd like to increase it but it's not the be all and end all yeah sounds good is that sounding right I'm interested in seeing um opportunities to empower residents like um it seems to be that the happen in community facilities whereas with all the issues and social issues and social isolation I think it's more important that we start empowering some of the residents from the bottom up to provide them with opportunities to say what do they want to do in their community facilities rather than having people tell them what they're going to provide for them in their community facilities thank you ann thank you thank you joanna and just further to that yeah how would how do you think that could happen what would be the best way to get that voice coming through would it be a community meeting at a library or um yeah the the workshops are a good idea because they're interested not everybody's interested in discussing um community facilities and community development it's boring to some people but those that are actually interested in supporting residents and giving them a voice and empowering them to find different ways to use different facilities in creative ways and get the uses up on the community facilities yeah I think just having more open and honest more opportunities at community board level to discuss these issues can you see can you see an opportunity for things like neighborhood support to perhaps be a vehicle through which people can get together in in chat yeah yeah and um I was thinking about something else too a residence association so you have you got one that you're active in uh no I'm not active in my one night no but there are quite a few aren't there and that they're also a good vehicle through yeah through which we can have these discussions yeah and my concern is that um residents associations get taken over and it becomes a combined voice of the residents rather than every resident gets to say their individual um take on the situation and what they would actually like so yeah so I think one of the things to notice is that this is a trying to be an enabling document so there are plenty of community facilities one in my local area for example where they asked the community what type of activities would you like and then the community yeah so that sounds great yeah and I know the same is happening with them and paul at the moment as well yeah that's great thank you thank you so much for your time okay next we have graham spinks who's also talking to us on the community facilities network plan on behalf of christchurch martial arts community welcome graham oh thank you for inviting me um I just wanted to say that I don't think there are suitable numbers of facilities in christchurch to meet the needs of the community especially east side um it was one of the nights that prompted me to call and inquire if I could talk today particularly martial arts groups we tend to hide away and in our white pajamas and small buildings and grapple each other or kick and punch each other to our hearts content but it's been a lot more difficult for a lot of people to engage in this sort of recreational activity that provides discipline in the community since the earthquakes hit there was a plethora of school halls and especially school all been taken over by other businesses and oscar businesses etc that are not available now for community groups to go into places at a at a cheap rate and to provide discipline for our community that need it most and if you want to see what they're doing right now you just need to go outside lynnwood mcdonald's at 11 o'clock on a friday or saturday night and have a look at what they're up to and I challenge people to do that because that's quite a tough thing to do to stand out on the street there and I know that countries that deal with these sort of problems what they do is they they they have these sort of problems and they solve them by engaging after school activities for children at a cheap rate and it's just not happening and you wonder why there's no discipline you wonder why people are assaulted you wonder why kids drift into gangs and you have these social housing issues and drugs and associated problems and they can be solved by careful planning particularly east side west side's been catered for by some rich russian thank god for him he's engaging all the the children in rolleston and those areas with olympic sports and I think that's a grand gesture on his behalf but um we need better planning on each side that's for sure and my own circumstances I've run a dojo for years in judo and particularly I've fostered other martial arts because I believe it's a great way to instill disciplines in communities but we were just established with the earthquakes we were on a park we had cheap rates for kids now we had to go to a commercial model and it doesn't really suit most people that really need the training and I say these people really need the training when I say that I really mean it I'm talking about kids with problems um anger management problems etc etc that tend to drift in towards martial arts clubs when they can afford it or when the parents can afford to get them there you know and I just a commercial venue and I noticed that there's so many around our area in shurim street there's so many similar clubs and similar situations have to drift to commercial models I mean cripes in other countries in europe they foster martial arts clubs and the reason they foster them is because they want children with self-control in their community with good discipline and good self-defense and that actually drives down the number of assaults at the angry age if you train your children well and you discipline them well you don't have problems when they're teens and hit the alcohol crazed stage of life that people tend to roll through and that's been proven so our particular club well and group of clubs we have to have a group of them and uh well we I find it difficult that a third of our members are consistently in arrest and yet we're trying to get a change of use from the city council now we've got we've got to engage architects and engineers on our side for a change of use that to to to to get a change of use and they're arguing fine points of of um the change of use at two hundred dollars an hour each I find it insulting well obscene that that that while they're arguing at a combined total of four hundred dollars an hour that some family can't afford to come in and pay fifty dollars a month for their kid to do kickboxing and yet we're paying these same fees you know we're community-based and lots of community-based groups are disenfranchised since the earthquakes and covert hasn't helped of course and I just think you know that that if we look after the more vulnerable people a lot of things fall into place in society you know you've got to call me a socialist but you know believe in that um okay um are you open to some questions yes so just before we get into other questions my first uh question is what is it that you would like changed in the plan so I know you've got some issues around other stuff I saying that you've got enough um facilities you know you haven't it's clearly shown because if you look at the cheap seats in germ street you start looking down there and all these different clubs and organizations are moving into those cheap warehouses and having to take up commercial models because of the lack of facilities and community um at community level you know you look after soccer and rugby they've got fields to play on the likes of martial arts we need these cheap halls to to to foster community spirit and and then they're not there you know it's um swimming in auckland at the commonwealth games um got a new venue where we're boxing in judo we were put in some hall and then after the hall we were just enfranchised as sports while while athletics got a new track and field stadium while swimming got their stadium while a hockey got a stadium you know we where's the hat that we can hang out our coat on for martial arts groups so I think we've got a then yani and then james um within this plan it talks about um being underway to look at the condition of different buildings our community board that I'm on um talked about looking at not just the number of facilities that are around but how much spare time that they have available to take on um groups that could use them like space that people could use and also the cost of them do you think that's something that should be included in this plan that would then would then give the information that you're I i looked at that um the new um stadium that you're going to build right in the center of town and looked at the pricing for the units well you it's unbelievable what are you going to get people you're only going to get professional people from the from the west side of town engaged with that community you're not engaging the east side I mean half the people on each side they can't afford like they get they get a full job and then a hours a week I mean how how can they budget their own lives around that sort of lifestyle let alone let alone afford you know the um getting the kids into clubs and and doing things it's just not feasible from their point of view okay it's just I feel that poverty is is driving a lot of the problems in the in that community and uh you know unless we have affordable affordable um activities for the children to engage there's going to be some angry kids out there so I've got yani then james yeah thank you um thank you for the deputation I just wondered if you think there's a need for council to have because the staff advice has been that this this isn't for sports groups this is community facilities plan so just in terms of having moving forward having a sports network plan where the sporting facilities and recreation facilities are clearly shown and gaps identified as as you've said and a process to look at what's needed is that something that you think would be well what I i can say what doesn't work when we have the old community centres and we try to mix it up with other sports they come in there and they stomp all over our mats they just respect them that doesn't work only what works for us is we have to have dedicated mat space committed to a particular group so together sharing a facility is fine but they need separate rooms for separate groups and that works better in that in that way because it doesn't work any other way because we don't get the you know like our martial arts particularly we we have a lot of foreigners um involved you know like immigrants I should say immigrants to our country get involved and a lot of poorer well the pacifica community and the um local local um um people it's it's that they are the most of our members I suppose so you know I'm going to try and get one last question on um pauline um thanks graeme a really good submission um how many group martial is there a collective well before the earthquakes I counted them as 120 and after the earthquakes I haven't actually counted them but I reckon we're down to about half and those that are surviving have to had to adopt a commercial model the thing is we've lost the whole tier of the the considerable number of the cheaper um clubs have gone and that's been part of the problem is that they've got nowhere to go right now and they've got it we for instance our club we've kind of we're trying to survive on the edge trying to make fees affordable but we're getting better at the other end with costs because we're in this commercial city yeah I appreciate that's a really good message to here and I also fully support the benefits of it as well I believe I believe the numbers are significant I believe that we'd rival hockey uh our combined total of martial artists would would rival the likes of um hockey I wouldn't say soccer but we're we wind up there yeah I will do if you just it's just a sec um there's two things firstly um I don't know who your local councillor is but the other issues that you've got at the moment around consenting and things maybe a conversation with the local councillor might be helpful just to look at the process there and the other thing is if you look at affordability at the moment and we'll get you in touch with our um funding staff because it may be that there's ways to get some funding for lower income families to help get those kids involved as well through the local community board maybe yeah so we might get some information to you in that space as well we'll run out of time now but because that's that's not for the topic for today so we'll get some information to you on some um some funding avenues as well and can we hear back from staff on the sports network plan and where that's got to yeah we can yeah I thanks so much graeme thank you thank you very much okay next we have um mark gerard who's going to speak on behalf of historic places canterbury regarding the heritage incentive grants and the intangible grants welcome mark counselors thank you very much I'm I was expecting it it's a verbal submission there's nothing wrong so you can relax um I wasn't expecting a deputation soon thank you that's on the agenda so this is um thank you for the opportunity to make the submission of deputation which has made reference to the following items on the council agenda before you that's item number 11 the heritage incentive grant funding updates to eligibility and guidelines and number 12 intangible heritage grant fundings guidelines for a new grant scheme the submission will be verbal and brief as historic places canopy wishes to inform the councils that it endorses the staff reports recommendations on both agenda items that's the theme turn the specific items on agenda item 11 uh this regards heritage incentive grant funding the strike prices request the council has approved the align the heritage incentive grant funding with the council's our heritage hour tonga heritage strategy 2019-2029 historic places canterbury as you were aware applauded the council for the formulation and adopting of this heritage strategy hbc considers the expansion of the grant criteria as in keeping with the intent of the heritage strategy covert 19 has had an effect on the christchurch economy whilst thankfully not as marked as the rest of the world resulting in heritage buildings projects that have been postponed hpc endorses the staff recommendations that the unassigned funds be carried over as we expect there will be a lift in activity as heritage building projects are reactivated we should point out is the obvious that such funding provides an incentive for owners to invest which should be and will be welcomed by councillors as it aids the city's recovery carryover funding allows proposed projects to be reactivated and moving to agenda item 12 intangible heritage grant funding guidelines for a new grant screen hpc recommends the council's approved reports recommendations hpc considers this alliance this with this alliance with the council's heritage support of the city's heritage in this regard hbc request the council's approved the purpose of the intangible heritage grant fund and we also endorse the recommendation that the funding for the intangible heritage grant funding be carried over and finally on another note council's strike places canterbury wishes to thank you for your efforts and we include the council staff in what has been a fragmented year that's an understatement we hope you managed to enjoy some smart phone free quality christmas new year holiday time with your partners and families and as a recovering almost completely recovered political spouse the the importance of the cell phone free area for families where you can't stick and look for your emails when that's when they're not looking for something thank you that's great thank you very much and thank you very much for the very timely advice um I bet my family thanks you um any questions for mark no no thank you very much coming in okay so um presentation of petitions there are none today
Thank you very much so we now move on to the public forum section of the meeting and we have two of those today so ihorangi if you'd like to come forward to the desk there and if you switch your microphone on so it turns green yep that's fine um so welcome um you'll be aware that you've got um five minutes to talk to us about your issue today thank you very much okay um the bus exchange opened in may 2015 with the at the cost of 53 million dollars um my issue today is around the youth that hang around in the exchange and their um violence and the yeah just yeah just the earth that hang around the exchange and basically the violence um the youth that hang around the business uh interchange all have some gang affiliation at the moment there are around 15 to 20 people that hang around the bus exchange and they're known as town bums on wednesday the 9th of december I had my phone stolen from inside the bus exchange and this wouldn the person in basically the the person has trespassed from both the exchange and the crossing um yeah also I have heard through the security guards at the exchange that the trespassers are going to be wiped there is a guy on the trespass list who grapes one of the security guards and the young person at the bus interchange and now they are allowed to have free reign basically if bus exchange you're allowed to go in and catch the buses and they may may well do it to another girl or a security guard um I have also been a witness to many fights at the exchange and this is not okay it's supposed to be a safe public place but at the moment I don't think it's safe for me and the staff and also other customers what I would like to see improve is more security guard and staff the trespasses to stay and either a youth worker or youth aid officer to be present at the bus exchange any questions thanks so much for that um so I've got not very good but um those are fantastic suggestions do you said that um the person that stole your phone was able to get into the bus exchange and and pass by security do you think there's also an increased role for perhaps better training and better retention of who is and who isn't trespassed at any one point in time yeah definitely thank you yani yeah thanks um thanks for the suggestion have you talked to council staff at all about the arrangements of security I made a complaint and how was that handled like what feedback did you get I haven't heard anything back right um and just do you think like I just was really interested in having a youth worker there but have do you have any thoughts on having a dedicated youth space like a a youth centre in the bus exchange would that be something that you think have you considered having a more permanent space rather than just a youth worker and if so what would that uh that didn't come through my mind but yeah okay thank you mentioned when you were talking that someone had been trespassed but then had free range of the the bus exchange could you um can a wee bit more on that sorry because if someone's trespassed then they should not be there for stop so so the person's trespass got wiped and do you do you know why they got wiped at all apparently the cats are attacking their trespasser all trespass people off the list well we can check up on that yeah I mean they do expire after a period of time so don't know yeah james apologies if uh you did mention this but when when I use the uh bus exchange there are security people there quite it's quite noticeable do you not see them I do but they yeah there's not they don't they're not active probably not active okay okay I'd agree with that to be honest to be frank I noticed that okay so I think thank you so much for coming in there's no more questions but what we are going to do is've got onto staff and we're going to get some information back for councillors and back for you as well and and might be able to share that with you um and and we will see where we can go from there but I think it'd be really good to have um young people like yourself involved in that conversation of what to do as well okay so thanks so much for coming in okay so our next public forum is um dave idale and laurie shaw who are speaking on behalf of residents of vogel street regarding an ocht development so welcome and if you come up to the front now this was going to be multiple separate presentations and what we've done is we've combined them into one ten-minute public forum instead thank you very much for coming in thank you for having us thank you um so we have um some slides to go up the one thing with the slides is when the slides are up you can't see the time at the same time yeah do you mind if I you can have it that's fine yeah because I don't want to overclock welcome good morning um so I guess a bit of background we've owned a house in vogel street since 2005. we rebuilt knowing that there was social housing behind us and that there was likely that that would be rebuilt at some point so it's we're not we're not against social housing we understand that there's a need for it and it needs to be somewhere we were hoping with the design for the rebuild that it would be sympathetic to previous developments that had happened on the site so directly across the stream from galton place is another piece of social housing it's mixed use it's got two-story single story it's built with permanent materials it looks really nice um unfortunately this is not the case sorry a little bit nervous doing that other people um the proposed design is is really none of these things it is poor design it will lead to dark units it will lead to disputes within the tenants that will 13 separate properties that back on to this development along vogel street so this is a small impact in terms of our local area sunlight and privacy would be the two key components that that that we're really concerned about in terms of what how this impacts um sorry I've lost my place I'm surprised that the design is non-notifiable given the size and the scale of the units they're simply not in keeping with what's already on site and um I feel that there could be some solutions that would be easily um easy to be kind of you know help with the design that they've put through I mean ideally we'd like to see a complete redesign that was more sympathetic to the area and also that would allow the units to have north-facing windows because currently they don't in the proposed design we understand that this is now gone to the planning area and the likelihood of that happening is pretty low so from our perspective moving the units off the boundaries so that they're not so hard both our privacy and our sunlight um and we would also like to see a planting strip placed between between the boundary and the and the redevelopment so that we just we can help kind of increase the thing um the other thing is I'm I'm also really kind of disturbed by the way that otahi housing trust has handled itself through this through this process there were numerous inquiries made by multiple people to them over the periods that this was obvious to everyone that things were moving these were universally ignored we didn't hear back from them at all period so the only engagement that we got from them was once they had submitted the plans to council and that's not really community engagement at that point that's kind of just telling us what's going to happen which is I don't know basically taking notice out the paper um and they've really used the the whole process around around the way that they've put the proposal together as a very much a box ticking ticking exercise like they've pre-planning meetings they've done a c-pit you know it's great that they've done all these these things but they've almost universally ignored all the recommendations from those from those things and they've just picked the ones that suit their design and then they'll tell us about how those are the most important things in their criteria so we just kind of feel that it's you know there could have been a better way of doing this and for for an organization which is basically de facto council this is just not best practice it's not even a good practice and I think the design shows that I'll pass over to lori now okay I am a home owner in the long row of six units where the ocht plans to parallel their longest two-story block of ten units directly to our west significantly impinging on our privacy and sunlight in every single other unit to quote the ocht the orientation of the block means overlooking between units to each other's internal living spaces is able to be minimized however the living areas and bedrooms of those of us across the fence and we will be looking straight back in their bedrooms to quote all outdoor living spaces will receive good levels of sunlight during the day however some of those yards will be in the shade of our building for much of the morning and their own building in the afternoon our yard will be plunged into darkness before 6 pm in the middle of summer the implications for wintertime when sunlight means so much to people like me with seasonal affective disorder is disturbing due to multiple health conditions I am home all day and in our yard our yard feeds us with its vegetables and fruits it's a second living and dining space it's a private sanctuary of greenery it's my evening sun and sanity plants and people don't thrive without good light a family would not have bought here 28 years ago if it lacked privacy or good light to garden those were prime considerations until recently we had no problem with social housing and are very much in favor of it problems the top of the street they finally hired a security guard I've heard that delta community support trust is overburdened no suburb should be so impositioned with such high-intensity social housing when other residents have needs too and the growth of the city is happening elsewhere with the gallatin place flats one of my former neighbours needed to put a restraining order on a tenant of the trust he was up front that he was straight out of prison and she was clear she wasn't interested in a relationship but he'd come drunk banging on her door in the middle of the night and tried to force his way in for the remainder of her time here she was terrified which entirely altered her life she was like many of the tenants in the set of units we live in a single mother with young children I would like to know for the safety of those in our units what is the proportion of men who will be living in this upstairs block and will they have in will they have criminal records like the one who this arise given the bank of windows that will look straight into the bedrooms of women and children and into their yards and conversely what is their management strategy when they house vulnerable tenants whose own bedrooms face some of the current tenants and adjacent units to ours who have allowed vulgar domestics which would echo back and forth between buildings or drug dealers despite the police getting multiple complaints have shown little interest in policing how do you justify this design where people are looking straight into each other's lives some on both sides may have quite troubling quite a troubling element to them ocht have argued to us that it could be worse but really it's in a similar league of bad design like the hnz building it's institutional not home-like for supremely pissing off the neighbours for robbing sun and privacy they have managed to only gain seven more units and introduce some of the worst aspects of higher density building in a neighborhood that really doesn't need seven extra units of social housing nor to dismantle decades of goodwill I was at ways so it flummoxes me that anyone could come up with a design that would put neighbor against neighbor in a formally harmonious relationship it doesn't serve its own tenants well in multiplying the number of shared walls and ceilings with each other and disrespecting both ours and their privacy and sunlight the trust is supposed to be about meeting vulnerable people's housing needs not eroding vulnerable neighborhoods they should do better by everyone this is a mistake that will have many decades of repercussions it's worth getting it right for the whole community they could have been part of a force that helps maintain the special character of the neighborhood but choose to be a destructive force in the march of anonymizing developments that treat people as stackables who don't need light privacy or safety I implore them to radically change their design thank you um are you speaking as well sorry oh no no no he's been running are you remembering okay so we do have uh 45 seconds if there's a single question um otherwise we have had a small amount wondering jake if you'd like to share that with them as your local councillor yep and actually if you would be able to facilitate a meeting with kate or someone at ocht um so that so that the the residents can actually talk to ocht about their concerns um face-to-face is that all right um because uh you know bearing about this particular property is not so ocht do um operate and manage um some council loan facilities these ones are not um so these are actually owned and operated by um and the developments being done by ocht itself um under their capacity so if jake if you're able to organize that and facilitate a meeting um and then maybe report back to as council to see if there's anything that we need to be looking at that would be really useful okay thanks so much for coming in so when I looked around initially the first 10 seconds looked for questions I didn't see a hand sorry do you think maybe you would like to go the meeting with jake would that be really the information that got provided it may be appropriate for that council and trust to talk through some of these planning issues but that's up for you guys yeah yeah but um there is a relationship between trust and counsel yeah okay so jake will bring back any information and and wasteford that you think that that need to happen there that would be really good the ocht the trust does have very strong wrap around services for the units if that's of any help to you as well I think which will come out of the media doesn't solve the privacy issues no it doesn't matter there's a broad range of issues there and I think that the best way to do that is to deal face to face and jake if you need help facilitating that doing that that's part of our complaint plus they also uh sublet a number of the units and the existing thing out to the salvation army which had different clients and different policies and different management strategies and that caused issues so we will yeah raising those concerns with us today
