G'day my name is Michael Malone I am the director of infrastructure and environment here at Wallin Delhi Council and one of my key responsibilities is looking after around six hundred and thirty million dollars worth of community assets the largest proportion of which is around four hundred and thirty million dollars worth of roads and when it comes to a road pavement the most important part of the pavement is the part that you can't see which is the road base and when we put the road base down we put a protective wearing course on it that's bitumen based that can be a spray seal or asphalt the challenge of putting bitumen bases it starts to oxidize when exposed to the weather the Sun the air the water much like your favorite plastic deckchair but plastic coated wire on your clothesline or the plain on your house as it oxidizes it starts to crack and that's bad news for a road pavement because that lets in more moisture that breaks down the road base eventually the roadway starts to come out of the pavement's no longer suitable for being driven on so as a part of looking after our pitch Manwaring courses we look at Road pavements that aren't in too bad a condition that are starting to oxidize and we apply a rejuvenation seal to make sure that we're in course lasts us for 10 to 15 years if not longer so this year we're doing a range of roadworks across the Shire we're doing about 5.2 million dollars worth a full pavement reconstruction were covering about seven locations about three and a half kilometres we're also doing another two point five million dollars worth of heavy patching and resurfacing works across 16 locations and they'll take care of about another seven point seven kilometers of road with the rejuvenation products that we're talking about today we're doing another 29 locations covering another 7.1 kilometres of roads across the Shire only three hundred and seventy thousand dollars trying to make sure that your roads stay in as good a condition as possible I hope this has helped explain some of the things that we you have any questions on our roadworks program please have a look at our website at one NSW give us a call on 46 double seven double one double zero thank you
Hi guys I'm just here to give you a quick update on the severe weather that we're expecting to impact the shire over the next 24 to 36 hours there's currently a severe weather warning in place that includes wallanderi and we're expecting to receive in parts various parts of the shire between 150 and possibly over 200 mils of rain in various spots in the shire in the next 24 to 36 hours and on top of that they're also predicting severe winds that might be in excess of 90 kilometers an hour gusts all of that rain that is predicted has caused a flood watch for moderate to major flooding to be issued and we're asking all our residents to prepare now we know from past history that if that flood watch becomes a flood warning and it is at that major level when we have major flooding we that's when we start seeing things like blackstone crossing comedy bridge all of the major bridges start being impacted and major flooding within the pixentown centre is obviously a concern as well at the ses unit headquarters at bridge street in picton or you can also pick them up if you're in the north of the shire at silverdale rfs station on marsh road sandbagging has commenced for the picton town centre a lot of the shopkeepers have started doing that this afternoon and rfs and ses are coming in this afternoon later on this evening to help with that sandbagging effort council staff have also been working extensively um to make sure that we've got the gutters cleared and the drains are cleared both in the picton town centre and across the shire at the moment we're unsure exactly what the impact of this weather system is going to be although we do expect that it will come across as an east coast low and is potentially going to have a significant impact on the shire council is working very closely with the ses and our other emergency services partners to try to prepare and we're really encouraging all residents to do the same and take the opportunity now to prepare because between the wind and the couple of days it might be very difficult to move around the shire we've also got our council crews out on the roads we've got all of council's crews plus a contract crew working almost around the clock at the moment trying to do emergency repairs to the road network we know that there has been significant damage to our to the roads not just in wellington but more broadly across the region and we're doing everything we can to try to keep them together as much as possible if you do see a road that is in need of urgent attention and is a safety issue please let us know please report it through the portal we're expecting that we're going to see can continue to see problems with the roads over the next couple of days with the volume of rain and we're already starting to see some road closures with the oberon stock route likely to be closed later on this afternoon the next couple of days could be quite difficult for everybody so please do what we always do times and I hope everybody stays safe and we'll give an update as the situation changes thanks guys

G'day guys and welcome to the february council meeting wrap up the first ordinary meeting of council for 2022 was held in the newly refurbished council chambers in the shire hall a great way to start the new term of council we will be looking into the viability of holding community forums in different villages around the shire to give residents in both awards the opportunity to raise ideas directly with council in my mayoral minute I reaffirmed our strong policy position on growth in happen that any imminent rezoning is inappropriate and must be halted and that any major growth there should not occur before 2036 at the earliest inappropriate infrastructure must be in place before any development we adopted the recommendations of the traffic committee in relation to road closures for anzac day the chemical clean out event and the thermia festival of steam our section 355 committees will also be continuing in their current format until the 4th of july council will be consulting further with residents that live near victoria bridge in relation to proposed traffic changes and any other potential solutions we need to in picton due to the growth in tamar and thermi and although the bypass is the long-term solution we need to address the issue before then in a way that has the minimum impact on the community council has been consistently calling for the state government to consult with wellington residents clearly about badgers creek airport the planning controls and the impacts from the airport council plans to inform residents within wallander affected by the western sydney aerotropolis set outlining the impacts on their properties I will also be meeting with other mayors in affected areas so we can advocate together on this issue if you'd like to find out more about what happened at tuesday night's council meeting head to the website to read the minutes or see the recording thanks guys and see you next month

wallendilly shire council resilience new south wales and the national recovery resilience agency we just over a week's time summer is set to commence and shortly after that we will acknowledge the second anniversary of the green model creek and moreton fires these bushfires threatened both the winter caribbean and wallingdilly shires for weeks over the summer of 2019 and 2020 in the two years since the black summer fires we've discovered that recovery is an ongoing process everyone's circumstance is unique and for many people their journey towards recovery will take years as a community we travel together on the path towards recovery and build our resilience for future events whilst we hope for the best it is important to plan for the worst and that's where this weekend's expo is important over the next three days you'll hear from experts about rebuilding after a natural disaster disaster of preparedness support services legal aid and much much more it is also an opportunity for participants to share their stories and experiences and to make new connections and contacts this expo is part of our recovery journey winter caribbe shire council is committed to prioritizing infrastructure projects and continue to implement environmental initiatives to help our landscape recovery and promote social connections to build our communities even closer together we continue to implement recommendations from the new south wales bushfire inquiry and our own independent review into the green wattle creek and moreton bushfires we understand that recovery and building resilience is a shared journey in closing I would like to say a special thanks to all of the emergency first responder volunteer and combat agencies for all of their efforts during and since the black summer fires our role at council is to support these lead agencies and each time an emergency faces our shire it's these agencies who are at the coal face of the crisis I urge everyone to participate as much

today's event you will hear from various speakers around rebuilding after a bushfire at the end of the program around 12 15 pm we will then be joined by all of our speakers as part of a panel to where you can write questions in the comments below and then we can direct them to the relevant person to answer if we cannot get to all the questions please know that we will take them on notice and come back with an answer all of the questions and answers for each day will be listed on council's expo web page you will also find on that expo web page links to various agencies along with video content messages and links to useful information I would like to welcome our first speaker jody from jd dang architect jd will it was formed and the services that they provide building material for bush prone areas jodie has spoken to wall and dilly before we're very excited to have jody back again today jody has over 10 years experience in architecture jd knew that sustainability was going to play a major part in the roles and the projects that she pursued in her career focusing on small to medium-sized projects jd has gained a strong reputation in good sustainable design in new south wales jody wishes to continue sharing her knowledge and experience in architecture and help each of her clients to realize their dream build through creating responsive and sustainable architecture welcome jody thank you I'll just share my screen hi everyone thank you for attending today my name is jody and today I'm here to represent architect assist I'll start my talk today explaining what is architects assist who I am uh what I could offer and then we'll move into material selection to bushfire prone areas so architect assist was an initiative started by around 600 architects in response to the devastation of natural disasters so architect assist is supported by the australian institutes of architects that everyone who signed up to assist assistant signed up to offer assistant needs to be a registered architect in order to request by assistance uh you can visit the website and click on the tab request for assistance from the directory you could choose from a range of architects and architecture studios which you think best suits your needs it is good to note that providers closer to the disaster stones are usually much more popular and that further away architects like more city-based ones are usually more readily available you could choose directly and contact the architectural studio directly or you could give them a call each studio and each architect offers a different range of services so you actually need to discuss what you like to do and then the architect and the architecture studios would come to an agreement of what assistance they will offer you so it could vary from just simple advice all the way to the full scopes of design in order for my services I offer from basic simple a development application to start building your new home you could contact me directly by my website or via email and my number is also on my website if you like to call me directly on the architect assist website there's also a lot of links that information you can access to help you rebuild this includes building codes sustainable guidelines and other necessary resources that you think will be helpful so just a little bit about myself which was already covered um I'm a city-based architect I'm a certified passive house designer which means I'm certified to design low energy and self-sustaining housing so these days when we start to construct homes we have an expected lifespan of 50 years for that home and in that time they may be subjected to multiple bushfires there are five ways which impacts the building smoke wind amber attack radiant heat and direct flame contact so many of you may have been given a bow rating for your area the bow rating is a construction guide for structures to withstand heat and embers attacks during a bushfire anything to bowel flame zone we are designing to allow our houses to withstand ember attacks and collapsing in extreme heat I'm going to go through how these five elements going to impact our design thinking and construction with wind during a bushfire the winds could go up to 200 kilometers per hour which is close to a category 4 cyclone so when we are designing we need to think about how big our windows are because usually we want expensive windows to capture the views of the landscape but at the same time during these bushfires the windows the bigger the windows the more they'll buckle and crack and ultimately break with ember embers are small pieces of wood and bark carried by the wind to ignite a house it accounts for 75 percent of damages caused by bushfires for structures in the bow 29 and over um we usually are designing houses to prevent embers flying into our home we are small gaps in our structure to allow the embers to come in and basically burn the house from inside out with extreme heat our structure needs the bush fire when the bush fire comes and your neighbor unfortunately gets ignited your house would also get in contact with the radiant heat caused by your neighbor and the direct impact of the flames today I'll be going through the highest building in the highest bowel rating which is bowel flame zone so we'll go through the walls windows floor decking and roof one of the biggest considerations we need to um consider is following the australian standards 3939 2018 construction of buildings in bushfire prone areas and this guide will kind of advise us on which building materials are allowed and all those buildings standing codes that we need to adhere to so for external walls it states that all external walls has to be non-combustible and a minimum thickness of 90 millimeters so this really does limit our structural selection to either brick or concrete if we want to use lightweight materials that is available as a choice but it is quite complicated to decode what is allowed in the in the australian standard so it is best to consult your architect or fire flaws and deckings in a bowel flame zone area has to be completely enclosed so this does away with all timber decking as it allows small gaps for embers and grass files to seep through to the house the most important coat to look for when you're selecting tiles as well is it doesn't conform with as13 1530 which is a non-combustible and bushfire compliant material so with your windows in a bow flame zone and bow 40 all windows needs to be screened so the house can be completely closed off during a bush fire you can either go for external metal window shutters or you could go for a perforated mesh window screen you can't just go off and choose any perforated metal screen the mesh needs to have a maximum aperture of two millimeters and made out of corrosion resistant steel so with all these rule in place it feels like your building needs to be an enclosed fortress I will now show you an example of a home built in a bowel flame zone so this is a house this is a two in the blue mountains in a malagong valley and this is an example done by anderson architecture so the entire co the entire construction the entire structural frame is actually concrete to comply with said and you kind of see how close it is to all the trees and the grassland around it the construction is also slab on ground so that allows embers and grass fire not to be able to penetrate the floor during a bushfire the design of the concrete is then cladded in in basically timber composite material so it's not actually timber it's a modified composite timber which is a non-combustible material and a decking which looks like timber is also a composite which is non-combustible so there are varieties of different materials that you could use that is not just brick and concrete to give the entire design a little bit more lighter feel and more inserting to the landscape all the windows on the facade are right about 40 and then additionally they have metal screens which allows the order windows and the house to be completely enclosed off during a views when there's no bush bushfire and to enjoy the beautiful landscape but it also allows it to respond to the bushfires and allow it to comply with about fz and have the entire house completely enclosed timber is allowed to be used but only for the interiors and that allows the house to be soft enough and you could use it for shelving units and internal cladding the floors however four barrel f set still needs to be either mainly tiles in this case the design went for polished concrete so that's the end of my talk today uh you could contact me directly if you would like to have more information about building in bushfire prone areas and I would like to finish off by thanking will and dilly council and ryan caribe council for having me today thank you thank you jody that was such an interesting presentation I definitely learned that and that house was incredible um if anyone has any questions for jody please type them into the chat um we will have a question and answer time later on this afternoon um to introduce the planners from both wall and dilly and woody harry shy council our planners today will discuss rebuilding after a disaster and what you need to know also how council is here to support you in that process apologies everybody the computer restarted just before we're just reopening the presentation sorry everybody sorry about that yeah so this is um the map that shows the extent of the bushfire and yeah more or less covers more than fifty percent of voluntary as well as um their neighbouring councils so in the aftermath council nominated us as the bushfire recovery office contacts and the painting directorate for all customers inquiries related requiring assistance in regards to the rebuild process this was set up so that bushfire victims had the same contact from start to finish when interacting with council during the rebuilding phase this service remains open to this day and customers are invited to contact council if they require any form of assistance so the first part of the planning approval process the rebuild you need to obtain development consent from council uh the same as you it that all applications required for rebuild developments destroyed by the bushfire events would not incur any assessment fees and we would try as best as we could to prioritize those preparing a da for council's review is a specialist task therefore we recommend that customers engage the services of relevant professionals such as just people planning consultants and the like jody's presentation before us was all about architects assists so we've put that link there and they help with providing professional services to help and support those affected by the natural disasters and bushfire events in addition to engaging professionals to assist in the preparation of the required development application council's advice is that one of the most important professionals to engage is a b-pad accredited bushfire consultant bushfire consultant will be able to help you determine your bushfire attack level help you during the construction process and advise you in regard to ongoing bushfire maintenance and survival plans the fire protection association provides a list of accredited practitioners than being accredited bushfire consultants on their website so you can be sure to engage a relevant page is attached we also engage the new south wales rural fire service in our assessments um so during the assessment period for development applications for rebuilds council will refer the applications to the rural fire service for their review and advice to make sure that the rebuild complies with all the relevant legislations such as their document planning for bushfire protection as well as all the current industry best practices it's very important to ensure everything is correct at the va stage to ensure the rebuild runs smoothly and that the proposal will be adequately protected and built correctly in line with the current legislation in response to the bushfire events new south wales government also introduced new south wales world fire service 2019 2020 bushfire rebuilding climb scheme which is known as bow capping concession in summary this allows owners of the rebuilding to build to a lower bushfire attack level provided other offset measures are implemented during the rebuild which could substantially reduce the financial cost for the rebuild councils have in support of this policy and react with the support of the new south bushfire consultant and liaison new south wales fire rule fire service if you intend to explore this rebuilding option using the bell capping so once you've obtained approval from council to rebuild prior to starting any of the building works you need to obtain a construction certificate from either council or an accredited certifier council provides this expert service which is also free of charge for bushfire victims if you nominate council as your principal certifier we'll inspect the rebuild at mandatory stages to ensure compliance with your approval council will also require the nominated bushfire consultant to inspect the rebuild at certain stages of construction with our council officers to ensure compliance with the bushfire protection construction measures throughout upon completion of the rebuild and prior to you moving in you will need to obtain an occupation stevia from your principal certifier as advised council provides this service free charge for all building victims priority issuing the occupation civic will inspect to ensure the building is safe to occupy and to ensure that conforms with all the bushfire protection measures that are being required and that they your nominated bushfire consultant to inspect rebuild once completed to ensure compliance with the bushfire protection construction measures that have been stated by the relevant consultant so ongoing maintenance so even with a brand new reboot home once you've moved in it's very important to ensure that a bushfire survivor plan bushfire survival plan sorry is created to ensure all the required bushfire protection measures are maintained as intended uh examples of these measures include ensuring the curtinage of the rebuild remains cleared and maintained ensuring bushfire water supplies are full access driveway is maintained and gutters are cleaned regularly council staff are dedicated to supporting the bushfire and disaster victims wherever we can the main contacts if you have inquiries are natalie mccullum which is council's community community recovery officer myself team leader of building privileges and certification jake abrahams is one of our senior building surveyors and kim hill kmuc recovery sport officer wallin delhi and winch caribbe from the national recovery and resilience agency and lastly uh information that council's um provided in our activate wallendilly uh long-term community recovery and resilience plan need to know in regards to bushfire and disaster recovery and that's the end of our presentation and we can take uh questions now but probably later at the end of the uh at the end of the day yeah so no worries thanks so much steven and jake so um yeah we did have a few technical issues issues there at the start so sorry everybody but the presentation will be available for people to view later um so if anybody has any questions for the planners and please note we also have the winch caribou planners on on board as well it's just that they were having a few technical issues getting on board so any questions please type them into the chat and then we can come back to those for our panel later on at about 12 15 today thank you boys online so we're just going to thanks matt so just while we're doing that too just to add as stephen and jake mentioned that there's a big team of us here at council that are happy to support when and jake mentioned feel free to get in touch with any of us at any time we'll definitely help you walk you through that process wherever we can and we try work together as a team as much as you can through that process so there's a lot of support here within council um to to help those rebuilds happen so thank you both so much we also have a really great rebuilding after bushfire document that has just been finalized with our graphic designers um that has been developed in collaboration with our planners and certifiers with the with the nwra so we'll be uploading that to our website as well in the expo content so we've just had ross bro winter cabbage eye council join us so ross if we can hand over to you just to touch on the rebuild and planning supports available through winter caribbean council that would be great hello um my name is ross johnson I'm the ethnic coordinator of certification at windsor caribbean um are you able to hear me yes we can hear you and see little bit of a technical problem we haven't been able to get up our presentation but we'll we'll send that through to the attendees a bit later I'm um pretty much uh winter caribbe has a similar policy to wall and dilly in that any applications that are provided to or submitted to us do not incur any fees and they do get a priority listing to uh for assessment and go through the similar processes what um was explained for wall on dilly there being referred to rfs and any of the other associated state government sections that are required to go to but that'll be all on our handout when it comes through shortly thanks so much ross we'll um attach all that information we'll attach all that information to the content for people to have access to via both council websites so and then again if people have any questions please type them in the comments so that we can come back to those for you to get some answers thanks kim so just checking before I move along sides for the planners for both councils thank you yes can you hear me jim yes I can oh so there we go I'm nancy I'm the acting manager for planning certification and compliance I just wanted to reiterate um what ross says and how seriously we've been taking bushfire resilience in australia our director king is very keen to help people in the shower with this issue um we've had a number of sessions um help sessions throughout the show to try and help our community um and we've got we've tried to put as much on the website in the past as we could during the actual during the worst of the fires um we were very very busy um as you as everybody was I think um trying to um has it just dropped out I think it has now we can hear you oh okay that's great thank you I think I'm not sure what happened with my link but it wasn't working very well there we go I think it says hello that works now normally of as I was just saying we we do have a number of resources already on the website and that will be improving over time um we have recently improved our website and but it's a bit of a work in progress um we've actually been getting some help from wall and dilly which is great so thank you so much the team at one dilly um we do we're obviously going through a lot locally as you did with this issue we do we've tried to bring in things as ross mentioned around free fees can you turn your sound off ross thanks um free fees which covers everything not just the d.a fee specifically but associated fees um for those in recovery um to try and help people and also a certain a team that will specifically look after and concierge those applicants when they put their applications in and to try and fast-track them just I think in the same way that wall and dilly has um so we're doing what we can to try and help as best we can but certainly sorry we haven't echoed this end ross can you turn your sound off please yeah thank you nancy thank you so much as we said we'll have um everything available on the council's website for people to access via both presentations so sorry there was a few i.t issues the joys of today's technology so we'll move along now to our next guest speaker so um I would like to introduce catherine so catherine gorey is with the bushfire consulting service catherine is the managing director of the bushfire consulting service which she established in 2010 holding bushfire planning and design accredited practitioner catherine is a qualified environmental health and building surveyor with over 16 years local government experience most recently with blue mountain city council as a senior development assessment officer and building certifier catherine is also the managing director of the registered training organisation building up skills and has designed and implemented the swimming pool inspector course as a registration pathway for new south wales swimming pool inspectors for the department of fair trading formerly the building professionals board catherine has and western australia building commission and delivers her own bushfire seminars to council officers building certifiers and architects and in partnership with the master builders association continuing professional development program for builders and in-house consulting for cpd for architects catherine has actively contributed to the technical advisory committee 20 bushfire safety of the fire protection association of australia for more than seven years and is a member of the western sydney university external advisory committee built environment and the former planning for bushfire protection implementation group welcome catherine and thank you very much for your time today thanks kim so I'm expecting my video to start playing yeah thank you hi my name is katherine gauri and today I'm talking about the role of bushfire consultants and what they can bring to your development process I'm a bushfire consultant and building surveyor and worked for 16 years in local government doing assessments of applications for development as well as construction inspections I worked for seven years at blue mountains council and I developed a particular interest in bushfire as you can imagine and studied for a graduate western sydney graduating in 2010 I then applied for and received accreditation as a recognised bushfire consultant bushfires are part of life in australia they're influenced by many factors including warm and dry conditions extreme heat strong winds and low humidity housing design and materials fuel loads and their management climate change is increasing bushfires throughout australia and this has resulted in a higher number of days of high or extreme fire risk over the last few decades climate change also brings an extension of the fire season we can still implement better land management learn from the techniques and past practices of indigenous fire management principles and continue research into our changing climate and bushfire behaviour and aim to avoid the catastrophic loss of life that has occurred in the past and never more so than the most recent bushfire season there are a number of strategies set in place by the government to manage bushfires in new south wales such as fire prevention in other words doing something about arsonists warning systems community preparedness prescribed burning monitoring and maintenance and using the planning and development control system I'm only talking about the measures that are in place to increase the bushfire resilience of housing stock at the development assessment stage your local council is responsible for preparing bushfire prone land maps for their council the commissioner of the new south wales rural farm by prone your local council can supply you with a section 10.72 and 5 planning certificate which will confirm whether your property is on bushfire prone land but you can also find out if your property is on bushfire prone land by searching the new south wales planning portal it's really important to understand that the map can't show you the bushfire risk applicable to your property which is worked out individually for each building project by bushfire consultant or the council it's easy to find out if the land is bushfire prone by going to the new south wales planning portal this fairly recent resource has got a lot of great information about all land in new south wales so go to the browser and follow the prompts until you find the new south wales planning portal click on for nine glenrock clothes picton so you start typing in the address and it auto fills once enough information is entered so you select that property from the drop-down list so when the property comes up some layers are already active which is usually the zoning layer so there's a little icon there to unselect all the layers so that when we get to the bushfire prone land map it's clear so scroll down the menu on the left hand side until you see the word hazard click on that to expand menu then select bushfire prone landmap now you can see the bush bioprone land map around this property we can make a few little adjustments to this website to make it easier to read this is what I normally do so I'm going to click on the bush fire prone landmap layer and make it a little bit more transparent then on the bottom on the right hand side you can select an aerial map to see under it so this just shows you how the red layer is the bushland the yellow layer around that buffer or the red layer is bushfire prone land it is not enough to know that the land is bushfire prone you also need to gain an understanding of the bushfire attack level and its implications for your new works this might be about the cost of the building works but also the materials that you can use it is important to understand the bushfire attack level for the location of the new work at the planning stage a complying development can only go ahead with a maximum bushfire attack level of 29 ball 40 and bowel flame zone require a development application to cancel if the bowel is 40 or flame zone you will not be able to have a granny flat a family daycare airbnb or similar development types the maximum bushfire attack level for these type of developments is about 29. the method for determining the bushfire attack level is set out in the new south wales rural fire service document called planning for bushfire protection 2019. the calculations are made from the fire danger index for the locality the type of bushland vegetation the slope the new work from the bushland putting all these things together gives us an understanding of how bushfire might behave in relation to your site there are six bushfire attack levels ranging from low through increasing race risk to bowel flame zone the bushfire attack level is a measurement of the severity of a building's potential exposure to ember attack radiant heat and direct flame contact you can find a list of accredited bushfire consultants by visiting the bushfire protection association of australia or the fire protection association of australia like any other industry ask for recommendations from people you know a bushfire consultant will come to your site and take photographs and measurements around the site and wherever physically possible out to 100 metres into the bushland causing the hazard the bowel must be determined by an accredited bushfire consultant or the council your bushfire consultant can bring many years of expertise to your project negotiate with the rfs and council on your behalf to get the best result for your site they can also help work with ecological factors that may impact your site this means providing situation they can go on to help you choose appropriate building materials and check in on your works as they progress to ensure bushfire measures are in line with the development consent conditions once assessed your new works will have one of the six bushfire attack levels applied the lower bushfire attack levels from 12.5 through to 29 mainly deal with ember attack so measures applied to your building works are designed to keep embers out of the building the higher bells being bell 40 and flame zone also deal with ember attack but radiant heat effects as well so this means that it's anticipated that flame may contact your house or building work so the building materials themselves need to be able to risk the resist the effects of this heat once the bowel is established you'll be referred to as3959 for the construction requirements for each bowel the components that are addressed in as3959 are all of the external building elements from the subfloor to the walls the glazing through to the roof verandas and decks so each bushfire attack level has its own set of general section at the beginning of the standard which applies to every bushfire attack level in new south wales planning for bushfire protection overrides some of the requirements of the standard you can find these from part 7.5 of planning for bushfire protection 2019 it's also a legislative requirement that each development must satisfy the objectives of planning for bushfire protection 2019 this rural fire service document can be downloaded from the rfs website these bushfire protection measures include asset protection zones the construction standards and design gaining access to the property having sufficient water and utilities to facilitate firefighting activities having landscaping that is consistent with the asset protection zone and having some emergency management practices in place which depends on the development type so for example emergency management arrangements are different for for example schools than they are for single dwellings your bushfire consultant makes an assessment of this in their bushfire report some of the reasons for using an accredited bushfire consultant include getting the most accurate bushfire attack level for your new works your bushfire consultant will be familiar with views of the rfs and as well as australian standard 3959 we will also aim to find safest position on your site for the new works in cases where there is a choice of positions we will try to reduce the bushfire attack level if it's possible and can suggest ways that this might be achieved for example redesigning a project if possible or minimizing the hazard also if possible we can also assist you find a better bushfire protection outcome where the risk is very high and the works are very minor using an accredited bushfire consultant gives confidence that you're dealing with a accredited and insured person who's an expert in their field we can also find an alternate solution sometimes for more unusual or challenging situations this photograph is from a dwelling that we worked on in conjolla park which was affected by the bushfires on new year's eve of 2020 we worked with the builder and owner to make sure that the building was constructed in accordance with the development consent which was a mixture of flame zone and forty and of the many buildings that perished uh with resisted the bushfire attack and remained standing with only very slight damage we hope to be able to help you with your next bushfire prone land project thank you very much catherine that was a really fantastic video I think for people that are not only rebuilding after disaster but just building a new house all the acronyms and the abbreviations and things can be so overwhelming so that presentation was really great and and I think the upcoming presentations are really going to assist as well just to break down some of the that overwhelming nature of when we look at this process um because there are so many people out there who can support you through that process so thank you very much catherine and look forward I'm sure you can have a lot of questions in the panel at the end so our next presentation is a joint presentation from lisa chu from the new south wales rural fire service and lou short from black ash they'll be talking to us today about bushfire attack levels or bowel ratings as as we've to help the community lisa is a supervisor development planning and policy for the new south wales rural fire services built and natural environment directorate in her role she primarily oversees development and administration of building bush fire protection and associated land use policy related documents and processes for new south wales as well as work in the related strategic planning space since coming to the new south wales rural fire service lisa has overseen significant reforms in associated processes and programs with an emphasis on customer service delivery improved efficiencies and outcomes and engagement with relevant stakeholders prior to her current role lisa worked in various roles at the then state forest of new south wales in areas that involve bushfire and has also served in leadership positions internationally and recognised volunteer organizations lou from blackash is a highly regarded expert in bushfire planning and design with over 20 years experience in local government the private sector and state government lou led the development assessment and planning for bush fire protection for the new south wales rural fire service at a state level he was responsible for the assessment and bushfire prone mappings in new south wales liu has extensive experience providing national leadership in building community resilience lou's technical expertise is in bushfire consequence management risk assessment and mitigation and specifically the planning and design of new developments in high bushfire sorry high bushfire risk areas to comply with legislative and planning requirements lou is an expert in designing solutions for complex and challenging projects where environmental engineering or design constraints need consideration when planning for bushfire lou has a deep operational understanding of how fire works in the australian landscape he has multi-faceted insight into how governments respond to this straight loo provides unique strategies to comply with regulatory requirements and safety outcomes loo's skills lie in developing strong working relationships with clients providing innovative solutions and clear communication to deliver optimum project outcomes lou's expertise lies in understanding the complexity of building in bushfire growing areas and helping clients navigate this challenging space some of our community members might be familiar with black ash as they've been assisting residents who are rebuilding after fire to obtain uh their bushfire uh which fire and I will I'm just going to set you both up as panelists lou I might ask you to start first if that's okay um we're just waiting for lisa to jump online so lou if I can hand over to you to start the presentation and then lisa I'll ask you to present afterloo of course um bear with me for two seconds okay have you got me there yes we do all good to go lou thank you excellent thank you um look a lot of this has been covered by other presenters this morning so I think I'm trying to just pull together various elements and give a couple of examples and I'm not going to read through everything and I'll just paraphrase some of the important points that people can take away the the important thing is that all new development in bushfire train areas across new south wales have to comply or consider these planning for bushfire protection standards um so it's not just residential houses it's aged care hospital schools that the whole gamut of increase resilience of communities planning for bushfire protection is called up in legislation um so it's actually a legal document and the the requirement for infill developments are existing houses alterations and additions um rebuilds after fire and things like that it is really to try and respect people's choice as to to where they live and providing a balanced approach to risk so that there's different ways and different considerations in getting outcomes for bushfire that I'll run through in a couple of minutes um this is all bound up in the national construction code and again I'm not going to get all sort of legal and things like that but it's it's not just stuff that council or consultants or the rural fire service make up there's actually a national system that all of this sits within um there's the the national construction standards that give you the different bushfire attack levels so this is not stuff that is just being made up as a new south wales specific response to bushfires or anything like that so there's within um so the the national standard which gives you the bushfire attack levels is an accepted way of coming up with accepted practice accepted standards what what works what's being considered by uh you know through various bushfires and responses to fires as what is going to give a degree of resilience to a structure during the impact of a fire and while while it passes um the important thing to remember with the standard is that even though you might be building to a very a specific bushfire attack level it's not a guarantee that the structure is going to withstand the impact and the fire so it's designed to actually for the fire to come up to the house to impact it and then for the fire to actually pass through and and go beyond and then the house might catch fire but the people can if they're in the house can then move out on the dirt ground or something like that so technically if a house still gets damaged or burns down but the people have been saved the standard and at infill houses so existing houses alterations and additions new houses rebuilds after fire and things like that it's complex because there's existing infrastructure in place the the roads the power the water all of these things that you might consider in a new area are already there um so you can have different people come up with you know looking at the same problem of what's the bushfire attack level that might come up with different solutions um and there's a the framework around that so within planning for bushfire protection there are these um bushfire protection measures so six of these things and and the way that we look at them is uh they're believers what what can you use to try and get the best outcome you can for the site and for existing houses it's mainly around and catherine mentioned this that the landscaping in as protection zones you're building construction and design so what what's the interplay of these things that actually lead to the the risk or the bushfire attack at a structure so your other pieces down here are already in place for existing houses and then the emergency management arrangements are more the operational response of fire authorities um the emergency management arrangements for vulnerable communities like schools and hospitals and things like that where you have quite detailed uh emergency management plans and evacuation plans so all of these things come together to say right this is the risk and this is how you might consider it and this is what you might do to to change or alter that risk in in some way for the infill houses and there's a couple of key words here that I've highlighted that to look at getting better outcomes so for existing houses for alterations and additions new houses what can you do to provide defendable space what what is a better bushfire outcome and this is where people either with council they're all fire service consultants that actually can provide the advice on you know what what's the level of risk and what things can you reasonably do to mitigate or reduce that risk so the risk base is very your own land so you're not actually passing an obligation or responsibility onto an adjoining land holder although managed land golf courses parks you know your neighbors manage land could be considered as part of an asset protection zone and looking at what you can do for existing dwellings to increase the the resilience and the durability of those buildings um to any to a fire that might come through uh catherine mentioned compliant development so I won't go through this very quickly the the main thing is it's only for infill residential development uh you can only do a compliant development for the the lower level risks of below 12.5 down 19 or 29 I didn't actually put that in um but they've got to be recognized by the rural fire services a suitably qualified consultant or a suitably qualified person if council are doing those things um and then if you're in the higher risk areas of balfouri or flame zone you've got to do a formal development application and a bushfire hazard assessment report so there's a a format and you can provide acceptable solutions or performance based approaches in there what what I thought I would do is just step through a couple of examples here and these are a couple of tables from planning for bushfire protection so there's different fire dangers across the state that we would consider so down in the alpine areas you've got this fire danger index of 50 some of the coastal areas and out west are a higher fire danger index of 80 and then you've got some of the coastal areas which is in the neck of the woods we're talking now sydney and sort of coastal areas which is a fire danger index of 100. so that sort of tells us that this is where we need to start thinking about what's the level of risk and and how we work it through so I'll step through a sort of procedurally how you do it so you you look at the slope what what's the slope underneath the hazard so it's what what's actually going to burn and what what so that gets you into this ballpark down here of 5 to 10 degrees downslope so away from the structure what's the sort of vegetation that you're looking at um so there's a couple of different vegetation types that are separated out for the acceptable solutions and this one might and most of the areas around sydney are forest um so you know you're in forest vegetation you've got a five to ten degree slope then you look at what's the distance of the structure from the actual unmanaged vegetation so in this circumstance I've said look it's it's somewhere between 36 and 49 meters so that's the actual physical separation of the the building then you combine all of these things through here so your 5 to 10 degree slope your forest vegetation your separation distance and that gives you the bushfire attack level and and that's been spoken about a number of times this morning of what what is the bowel and we've seen different um images of what what that actually looks like um so bushfire attack level is in terms of what that might look like um there's a couple of different sites here so you'd combine the the vegetation and slope out through here you look at a house so here's the plans and you say right here's flame zone about 40 bell 29 bell 19 and bell 12.5 and you always take the the highest bushfire attack level that's affecting the the structure so in this case this one is a bell 19 house this other example over here again you've got the forest vegetation the slopes have been calculated you've got um bell flame zone about 40 about 29. so this structure here is going into bell 29 and and so you can get an understanding of where you sit in the landscape what the different bow levels are and how that might influence things so the the issue then becomes what can you do about that if if you can do anything um you know I'll just get there we go so effectively the the way you can do something about the within the site itself so you're increasing the separation distance but where you've got an adjoining land holder it might be private property or national park or department of lands crown something like that you can't do anything about it so if you move the building closer to the hazard you go into the flame zone if you're moving the building further away from the hazard then you're reducing the bushfire attack level so there's a little bit of latitude there and when you've got small blocks it's it's quite difficult to do anything about it but you might be able to approach the neighbor and say look can can we manage land out here in which case you need an easement or some form of approval for ongoing management of that land um but so there's a couple of mechanisms if you've got bigger parcels of land it's a little bit easier to look at managing vegetation and residing buildings and things like that but then you start coming into biodiversity credits and issues with vegetation retention you know what what does this look like so following the 2019 2020 fires um we we did a lot of work for the rural fire service in residence near south south wales trying to work within that streamlined process that's been mentioned already so this is lake cajola and the yellow dots are houses that were damaged or destroyed in the fires so then at a precinct level you can actually say right what's the where's the boundary between managed and unmanaged vegetation and then where do these houses sit within the landscape that allows people to then say right well what if I move my house further away or closer in so you start being able to provide a little bit of control if you will around what level of risk that the future house may well be at and what you can reasonably do to reduce your bushfire attack levels and construction costs and things like that so you can start moving around those things and this is where the belt capping very much came into it that's been mentioned earlier as well's not a we get asked this a lot you know what's the various costs of the different bushfire attack levels uh there was quite a good article in fire australia magazine uh some recently that looks at it's a west australian-based research for the different construction levels what is the over and above cost of the various bushfire attack levels for a standard residential house so for bell 12.5 it's about 3.8 and then you're going up to about 40 you know sort of that 10 mark in bell flames is 20 over what you would normally expect but you you would need to go back to your architect or designer or builder and say right what what does this actually look like um what what are the what are the costs of these things and what does that look like and certainly becomes a very important consideration and that is me thank you folks thank you lou um we have lisa from the new south wales rfs online lisa can I hand over to you for your presentation please yep hi everyone my name and policy unit of the new south wales rural fire service development planning and policy oversee all policy related work concerning bushfire protection associated with building development and land use planning across new south wales for the rural fire service we also oversee bushfire prime land mapping for all of new south wales our goal is to provide policy and related support to the public and all relevant stakeholders such as councils and bushfire consultants to enable and facilitate streamlined consents approvals and compliance you might have heard someone mention you need a bell or a bushfire report if you want to do a renovation or construction but how do you know whether you need one and what does it mean bushfire is part of the new south wales landscape as you've been hearing both state and local government recognise this and the new south wales rural fire service works closely with councils to map areas of vegetation hazard across the state including forests and grasslands this is known as bushfire prone land red identifies forests light orange which some people may see as a dark yellow identify as yellow identifies a buffer around the bushfire prone land where homes may be affected by bushfire bushfire prone land identify areas where bushfire has the potential to impact the rural and urban environment it's used as a trigger that requires homeowners and communities to consider bushfire protection when undertaking development in or near the hazard just because an area isn't met it doesn't necessarily mean it isn't bushfire prone and it can occasionally a consent authority such as a council might still ask you for a report considering bushfire even if your home isn't mapped as bushfire prime if your home is on bushfire prone land you need to get a bell rating and may require a bushfire report to supplement your development submission so what is a bell bowel stands for bushfire attack level it is the rating of bushfire resistance for your home and is calculated by considering the vegetation hazard the slope under the vegetation the distance from the hazard to your home and the fire weather characteristics for the area you live in bow ratings are site specific to a property have the same rating bells range from bow low to bowel flame zone also known as bowel fz lower bowels are concerned with ember protection and higher bells risk more exposure to radiant heat as well as embers with bowel flame zone exposure being the most vulnerable to attack from a bushfire the higher the bowel the more your home may be exposed to attack from a bushfire so how will it affect your home if your home is on bushfire prone land you're required to get a bow rating if you're doing development and this includes adding extensions upgrading external parts of your home build or building a new home whether from scratch or knocking down and rebuilding your bowel rating may require you to include bushfire protection measures and the design of your development bushfire protection measures include asset protection zones and these are a buffer zone between vegetation and buildings managed to minimize vegetation fuel loads and reduce the potential of heat and flames access this might be driveways and roads it enables residents to evacuate and it also allows emergency personnel to undertake firefighting the materials you build with and the location you build on your property enhance the survivability of the building landscaping consider the trees the vegetation and landscaping elements such as for example wood chips in your garden to ensure you aren't adding fuel to a potential fire if it gets close to your home and also we need to keep up ongoing maintenance to ensure gardens don't become an additional hazard that could compromise the safety of the home services for example your water supply water is essential to fire fighting utilities like gas and electricity also need to be considered and located away from the hazards so that they won't contribute to the risk of fire emergency and evacuation planning whilst these aren't currently compulsory for residential homes anyone living in bushfire prone areas should prepare a bushfire survival plan the higher the bowel rating your home is built to the less likely ignition from a bushfire will occur however it is really important to understand that even building to bowel flame zone is not a guarantee your home will be safe during bushfires it prepare you your family and your home in the event of a bushfire you should plan to get out as early as possible in accordance with your bushfire survival plan guidance on developing your bushfire survival plan can be found on the new south wales rural fire service website or you can contact your local rural fire service brigade to assist you another way to understand the risk of bushfire to your home is to use the bushfire household assessment tool which is also found on the new south wales rural fire service website our website has a lot of information that can help you understand and prepare yourself your family and your home for bushfire if you wish to inform yourself about building developments in bushfire prone areas our website has information on that too you can find out if your block of land is on bushfire prone land using the bushfire prime land tool on the new south wales rural fire service website but alternatively the department of planning have an online spatial viewer where you can type in your address turn on the bushfire prone land data wales rural fire service and our team the team I'm part of produce planning for bushfire protection it's a guide on the appropriate bushfire protection measures for building development which you would have seen lou just show pieces of um and our website has a variety of policy notes and fact sheets on particular building development issues if you want to get an approximate idea of the bowel on your property you can also use the single dwelling application kit which is also on our website but I do need to say councils may not accept this kit and it's really best used as a guide only or for very minor development such as a small shed on a very low risk site one thing that is important to note is that the new south wales rural fire service we don't prepare bowel ratings the tools on our website can guide you and help you get a general idea however we strongly suggest you talk to an accredited bushfire consultant to get the right information for your site you can find a list of accredited bushfire say thank you and you know please stay bushfire ready thank you both lisa and lou for those presentations um if anyone has any questions for lisa or lou um please have a think pop it in the chat um what we might do is we are running a little bit um ahead of schedule today so nat and I are going to go through both council's um rebuilding after bushfire documents they're both very similar um however we'll go through them with you now just for a bit of info okay thank you corinne so um after the fires winter caribbean council developed a really great document about rebuilding after bushfire which talks about some of the policy and bushfire attack level new south wales rfs and state government restrictions that are in place and also the supports available within each council so I'm just going to quickly share my screen just to show you these documents so we'll be uploading both of these documents onto the um onto our expo session sections of both websites after this as well um our one is ours is is quite a new document so I'm just going to quickly share my screen with you sorry so these documents here are available but then there's also the other sport so as steven and jake mentioned before that there have been feast wave for different aspects of the planning process so one of the things that people can do is to come in for a free pre-ga meeting they can always come in and chat with the duty planner at council as well um to get some more information about that building process and getting started after fire I'm just going to run through these documents so the first one here is a mulch fact sheet that we put together um in with our environment team here at council with some information because it's obviously something that um people have a lot of questions about after a disaster when trees are down and people are getting a lot of trees chipped on their property we've seen it again recently with our storm in bilmir as well so we have this um this mulch will be uploading to our website okay and then multitasking which is cool you can see I'm I'm still learning my zoom my way around soon but we have um so this is winter caraby's building after bushfire document so this was developed in 2020 following the fires and is already available on winter caribbean council's website we will be putting it on the expo section as well but this can be just a really great document to have on hand so it talks about not only the rebuilding process but things around common questions that come up around shipping containers and storage and temporary accommodation as well so obviously with the not-for-profit groups like mind roo and habitat for humanity doing temporary housing options this can be a really great document to refer to when you're going through that process and to make decisions or putting storage containers on property to store things while you go through that rebuilding process um and then we also have the well in delhi shire council version of that document as well which as I mentioned is quite but we will be putting it up today after this expo so this has been based on the winter caribbean document um we've also added in the local context around wall and dilly as well so both of these fact sheets can be a really helpful resource for people when you're first going through a disaster event so some of this information will also apply to flood and storm rebuilds as well in terms of the temporary accommodation options and around those processes and some of the support available to disaster impacted residents so these are really great resources that we'll have up on our website very soon awesome thanks so much for sharing with us that with us matt what we might do is we might break for 10 minutes you might be all dying for a cup of tea or a cup of coffee but what I do challenge you there are 20 over 30 of you online today so maybe as you're grabbing a cup of tea have a think um about just process that information that you've just um experienced there on the way back and we'll introduce our catalyst up and we'll have a conversation around that definitely and feel free to ask questions related to final storm as well so we've obviously just had a significant storm event in filmy um so I know some of these questions are also going to apply to people um in film here as well so I can see we've got a couple of zombie locals online so feel free to pop any questions in the chat for any of our panelists here today thank you everyone we'll just we will see you back at 10 40. yeah sounds good great thanks everyone hi everyone welcome back from the break and thank you all for staying online with us um just wanted to start while we let everyone return back from the break by sharing a video from the nwra so as kim mentioned at the beginning today's expo is a partnership between world jillian winter caribbean councils brazilians new south wales and the national recovery and resilience agency so resilience new south wales and the nra after the 2019-20 bushfires and tomorrow we'll have a presentation from the executive director from resilience new south wales but we're just going to share a video about the national recovery and resilience agency just to give everybody a chance to return from the break we're getting some really great questions in the chat but just going to share this video quickly before we start our panel discussion whether a community has been through a flood bushfire cyclone years of drought or some other disaster like the pandemic recovery for some will take time so a national agency that will stick around for this recovery we'll draw on lessons from previous disasters we'll ask the important question what do you think is needed and will champion steps to listen the impact of future disasters is something that I have long strongly advocated on 5 may of this year prime minister scott morrison announced the establishment of the national recovery and resilience agency and that was in response to a key recommendation of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements this historic move means australia's capability to be better prepared for natural disasters and drought and recover from all hazards from our origins after 2019 north queensland monsoonal trough the principle of locally led likely understood locally implemented has guided all of our work we have staff in every australian state and territory and this includes our recovery support officers or rsos as we call them who operate from their agency vehicles they work closely with their local councils and other community leaders government agencies and industry bodies prime minister morrison calls them our boots on the ground and hearts at the table and they make sure people get the information they need and direct them to the right help and support for their particular situation the national network is a critical part of our operation you can't create government policy and services without knowing how they'll play out on the ground and without understanding the people that they're designed to serve the survivors my experience in north queensland gave me a deep understanding of the long-term impacts of natural disasters on regional communities shortly after my appointment I was areas and I came to understand just how devastating widespread and shocking the event was we work closely with mayors council staff community members graziers farmers and small business owners to understand their recovery needs and then to make sure that the government's support hit the mark now as my role takes me to areas impacted by the bushfires floods and cyclones elsewhere often overlaid by years of drought mice plagues and grasshopper infestations and covered restrictions I continue to be impressed by the way people affected by these significant challenges get on with the job of putting their lives and communities back in order we australians are a stoic mob communities are best supported by everyone working together the national recovery and resilience agency works hand in glove with states territories and local governments who also play a vital disaster response and recovery role and who are a key agent in helping communities to minimise the impact of these natural disasters we all have a role to play in the immediate response recovery and preparedness phases and our collective efforts will lead to much better outcomes for australians deloitte access economics estimated that for the preceding decade natural disasters have cost australia over 18 billion dollars per year on average taking into account both tangible and intangible costs while much effort is and must be focus on the immediate cleanup and reinstatement of essential public services and infrastructure we need to do this rely on the future and not just build back but rather build back stronger we need to do this to try and break the cycle of building repairing and replacing only to have to come and do it again when the next storm cyclone or flood strikes as a nation we are good at mopping up cleaning up standing up we are after all the land of drought and flooding rains tragically but it is simply not sustainable for the taxpayers and ratepayers to keep picking up the tap the national recovery resilience agency will drive efforts to minimize risk and the impact of major events it's imperative we do this the productivity commission findings cited by the insurance council australia reveal that 97 of all disaster planning is spent on the cleanup 97 now we need to flip that we need to address the imbalance the science tells us that longer hotter drier summers and more extreme weather are here to stay we can never flood cyclone drought or fireproof the country but we can do better preparedness I know that resilience means different things to different people depending on where they live people who had everything thrown at them across generations don't need a lecture on being more resilient don't need more slogans what they deserve is the support and encouragement to be better prepared and every level of government has a role to play together in partnership with the local communities that they serve preparedness must be the prism through which local communities plan and execute real fair income strategies that work for them and their particular circumstances through the national recovery resilience agency and other initiatives the australian government is throwing substantial support behind local communities these are your communities to help prepare for disasters and to minimise their impacts however there are many players in the recovery space and the australian government is but one state agencies and risk reduction cannot be the work of government alone the public also must step up we all share this responsibility it's estimated that many of us are simply not prepared we have a generational opportunity to address many of the challenges we face the responsibility to balance public safety and our expectations of the australian way of life with what is responsible and possible development is long past you now this is going to be a difficult and at times painful national discussion living life among the gum trees developing on flood plains and cliff tops in coastal areas and building homes and workplaces that are not fit for the risk must be challenged they have to be challenged this is not an exclusive list the challenge is how we collectively prepare ourselves for the next disaster while assuring that we support those recovering from the last because there will always be another major event to challenge us as a country thanks for sharing that that so um so I just wanted to thank so far everybody that's contributed this morning um and what we would like back to the platform so that we can answer some of the questions that have already been put into the chat into the q a section to make it a bit easier I will get nat and corrine to go through those questions from their end and then if the relevant agency or person could please answer those questions that would be greatly appreciated thank you okay so our first one is for the rfs so wondering if rfs or console consultancies have any data related to house losses from the 1920 built to bfp spec specification compared to those that were not bf fears but fire protection matters uh so we do have the house lost data um we currently have research actually being undertaken to try and specifically look at that obviously it's quite a complex data set to deal with because across the state we have a number of councils that we're trying to get information from and it varies from digital to microfiche so there is definitely research being undertaken but there are currently no results available we also have a couple of other to try and provide even more information but they're currently still in the um design phase um and I guess the other thing to say is that the bushfire inquiry for the 1920 fires did state that it considers fewer homes were lost uh because of the introduction of planning for bushfire protection and the bushfire protection measures that several of the homes in these fire affected areas actually did have on their structures that's great thank you lisa that's really interesting to know and very very reassuring as well um our next question is why is it when a private certifier is used that neighbors are not notified of plans on adjoining properties which may impact their property and privacy stephen or jake are you able to provide in any information for that question okay I can try and answer that one for you so when a private certifier is used there are certain instances where they need to notify neighbours that's in the environmental planning and assessment regulation but in some instances and they don't need to notify natives especially in rural contexts reason why you wouldn't be getting notified in overall context yeah 29 can no longer be a sister's compliance development application has to be submitted to the council is a telemedication and then of course uh what falls into play is council's notification policy and whether or not council normally notifies neighbours of submitted applications yes jd um adding on to that usually when a private certified is used for other than going into council for development application compliant development has a lot more stricter rules than development application so usually a private certifier cannot hand over construction certificate unless all the rules are complied to and that includes privacy to neighbors so usually you ask you know I safeguarded on that therefore they could bypass notification thanks shady ross or nancy did you have anything that you'd like to add okay no problem we'll move on to the next question okay so what is what is someone is still at the beginning of their rebuild journey where should they start and who do they talk to I might just jump into that one at even after the green water creek fire we're still seeing residents who are at the beginning of their rebuild journey and I think it's a really difficult one for residents because quite often there's so many external opinions and comments that are made from people about where where they expect people to be at two years or even one year after the fires um so I think this is a really tricky one very complex one um yeah it's really important to note that most people that are in these in situations where they are forced to rebuild never really expected themselves to be in this situation ever in their lifetime they went and bought a already built house for that sole purpose that's just not wasn't in their radar so it will take a number of years almost to understand the whole process what you might want in our home whether you want to rebuild to the same specs it's a really emotional long drawn-out journey and it's really really hard especially when external facts like oh you haven't started I haven't_''_6929.92 been bushfire impacted but it took me many years to understand the whole process and to have a look at what my options were so um yeah that's really it's a very very good question and one that we do all understand um where should they start I think we've given some really good um resources this morning so the architects find an architect or someone um in that in that area of expertise to have a chat with um you could probably add a little bit more to that jody so you're there on that consultation period so yeah a very good place to start is to speak to an architect we understand the entire process of everything and at the same time we could also work with your budgets so um if your land was rezoned from say about 29 to about 40 what are the implications of the cost and what's the implication of the size and sometimes where your house was originally located may not be able to be there again it may have to move on the where their house had to be moved even though they're on the same side on the same site so sometimes navigating through all the different resources and also the steps going for council is quite complicated and an architect is well um you know we do this every single day so we're kind of well in tune with all the different steps on how to start rebuilding from a council point of view jake where do you suggest yeah I think that's a good place to sign the architect playing consultant uh even bushfire consultant at the start so you can yeah you know know where you're going from the start as to where your bail rating would be where the best place to build is uh that sort of thing and also council officers you wanted to speak to us we're happy to help and put you in the right directions and so because our process can be so overwhelming as well we're very fortunate to have in place the recovery support service which was put in place by brazilians new south wales blue mountains after fire events up there and then in 2019 20 across the state uh and then also um positions like my southern korean community recovery office offices within council um so because the process can be so overwhelming and so complex because there's so much emotional attachment too for the residents who have lost their homes the recovery support service can really help with that process by just making some of those additional protocols and helping navigate that path our recovery support service has worked with I think um over 280 people across wall and jilly and winter caribbe um I hope that's the right start daniel um but they so they've seen a lot of this stuff before as well so they understand the role of bushfire consultants understand the roles of council planners and architects they've got contacts like architect assist um and they can help navigate that process as well so from that um I guess that well-being and that personal point of view um before we even look at the process point of view which is where all these fantastic navigate that professional those professional services as well yeah if you are interested in learning more about the rss on sunday please log in they are coming on and doing a presentation on sunday it's three wonderful women that we've both worked um with have been outstanding in this space and just really really well and we all work really well together so reach out I call them bushfire recovery or now disaster recovery personal assistance because they just help navigate that path yeah lisa you've got your hand up as well from rfs yeah I just wanted to mention that um if people did lose their homes during the 1920 bushfires and are trying to rebuild we still have the bowel capping program in place so what that is is whilst rfs don't do uh bowel ratings we've actually um along with lou's company black ash if we have a special email and people can actually email rebuild at rfs.newsouthwales.gov dot a u and we can organize to get free of charge a bell map but it's only for um people who or like for like back on their site it's not if you're you know gonna subdivide the block or anything like that it's it's basically you know like for like so you lost your home during the fire and you need to rebuild it back and we'll you know we work very hard to try and ensure that people are able to get that bowel map so that they can proceed through to to make it hopefully a little easier on them definitely I know some like our certificates have been fantastic we've referred quite a few residents across for those bowel certificates and they've been great they come back um really quickly and with that information it can help people get started so it's definitely a service we've taken advantage of I think in both shows since the 1920 bushfires we did have a question also in the chat that relates to that lisa as well which is around subsequent disasters so in wall and jelly we've had some subsequent natural disaster events including severe storms and floods if events are they able to access the black cash program the the program was only set up for the bushfires uh and it's uh specifically through rural fire service I am unaware as to whether there are you know any equivalent type of programs through ses or the department of planning to assist with flood-impacted structures sorry no problem thank you lisa our next question is why is the process for rebuild so long are the gas getting through I can probably question on that one so um so from council wellington's point of view uh now we would know the exact number or close to but we've had five or six rebuild applications yeah um they've all been improved relatively quickly we prioritize those but it's it does take a long time there's a lot of different people that need to be consulted rfs sometimes when there's street clearing involved there's environmental constraints we have to consider as well neighbor notification so there is things that do make it take a fair amount of time but yeah we do try and a misconception that's out there with community as well so um we had if we look at the the number of rebuilds that we've had we've had only I think around 50 of our total homes lost who have submitted da's to rebuild and there's a whole lot of reasons behind that and it's such a case-by-case basis and everyone's circumstances are so different um and I think there was one da that we had that did take some time to get through but that was because it was our first da that was using bowel capping and I actually think it went through considering that that was our first bowel capping application went through really well um but most importantly it went through correctly and thoroughly and it's so important to get that right so yeah and I think that the planners from both councils who worked alongside rfs um so lisa and david's team at rfs were fantastic through that process so uh it you know it's always good to get through da's quickly but with something right and I think it was great that rfs and council work together through that our capping process to get that that right so that the residents rebuilding have that protection because obviously they've been through such a traumatic event we don't want to add any trauma to that process by quite um taking shortcuts so and I think that that was a really great outcome in the end yeah so I guess yeah the process for rebuild so long for those that aren't actually really rebuilding and asking that question so go back to what we're saying before there is this a huge emotional and traumatic journey behind to getting to that point of actually submitting a da um for just a bit of like um stats windy caribbe lost 68 homes and um only 12 have submitted da's and only three have been rebuilt and so we're talking two years on now so we're only just seeing that process even just starting to happen now there's a few more in the pipeline about to come through but like I said support service they'll help you through that journey matt and I too as well if you need to speak to anyone in council we're a good point of contact to start with because we point you in the right direction as well and get these guys on board so hopefully that's answered your question anything dad that's good other questions oh I'll add something okay my I'm also part of organizations called architects about fronties and worked on areas where more internationally where areas were affected by tornadoes and earthquakes rebuilding a community is not a very fast process so rebuilding community takes up to 10 years before you see a community starts driving again after a disaster has hit them so sometimes when you look around and you see that like your neighbours are not rebuilding or your community center that's been burned down and you're thinking why hasn't things started rebuilding it's not it it does take a lot longer um like the counsellor said there is a trauma associated with it and some people sometimes think would process and that recovery process is a it takes it takes time and seeing other communities that's been hit by natural disasters the average time is 10 years yeah and just so um along those lines too so 30 of our total loss residents have rebuilt so repurchase other homes as well so they haven't maybe necessarily made the decision that they're not going to go back um they still have their land but we have some people who have bought other homes just while they go through that process because it is a huge thing it's a traumatic experience to go through some of our residents for their um during the fire on their block or in their town during the fire so there's a huge emotional process that goes along with making those decisions even about whether or not you will rebuild and totally come along on sunday because anne lederman is talking about that disaster recovery getting over a disaster and what that looks like navigating that medium to long-term recovery process so that she's got a powerful speaker and um oh sorry captain you're just on mute yeah I just wanted to add that um I was speaking recently to someone who had been involved in the blue mountains recovery program after the spring would win relief fires in 2013 and I had this conversation last year and I was told that about 30 percent of residents had chosen not to rebuild so that quite a few years have passed since that fire and the recovery process is certainly very slow I think as well as residents are asking how can they start this process of recovery from from a bushfire consultant perspective I i really encourage people to find out the appropriate bushfire attack level towards the beginning of the process because you can save a lot of time and effort and money by avoiding redesigning something later when you find out with the values so we get a lot of clients coming to us who have completed all their plans including engineering and structural plans and you know we can suggest how they might um improve their prospects of resisting a bushfire which essentially sends them back really dislike dislike it when that happens because I know it's costly for them um so find out what your belly is early on absolutely also been chatting with the neighbor the other week who's not rebuilding after five but was looking to move to a bushfire crane area and thankfully had engaged the bushfire consultant before he purchased the block um which he just said he was so glad that he did because he actually made the decision not to purchase that walk in the end because once he went through that that process and and saw that the property was belle flame's own he decided that um the cost of building on that block was going to be beyond his means so yeah it's not just rebuilding that we need to make these considerations but also just um when buying land or moving to a bushfire prone area this one yeah how long does sorry I just saw another question that I would like to answer because somebody asked I saw earlier why two neighbours might have a different vowel and when their circumstances to try and explain that a little bit sometimes uh residents might think that their circumstances appear to be exactly the same but actually their building might be closer to the hazard or when we look at the slope that impacts the building on each side the the gradient of the slope might be steeper for one compared to the other so often there's things that you you might not readily appreciate in determining the bowel that can actually make next-door neighbours have a different bowel sorry if I butt it in then okay thanks for that um how long should a da take from lodgement to approval how long from da approval to construction certificate okay so I think I've touched on a little bit before but it's very hard to put a number or day number or month number on it some can be four weeks some can be 20 weeks it just really depends on each um each property they're all different they all have different considerations but um you can be assured that council will try and prioritize it as best we having coming in with your builder or your architect and having a pre-da meeting absolutely that's a good idea that way you can um you can sort of nut out the issues that might arise during the assessment period up front and yeah it helps when you have a complete application that way you don't have to ask for additional information during the assessment process as well and one benefit to using council we can often issue the da and the construction get concurrently together so that can save time as well rather than consulting with the private certified later on so something to consider as well yeah and just touching on that additional information that you just said then I think sometimes there's this preconceived idea that you lodge your da to council and it goes through the da process and your certification and there may be a question um regarding the certification of that part and that council will go oh that's incorrect and then refuse the d.a just to reiterate council's actually here to work with you so any of those questions you through those additional information I might be simply providing something ex extra from the um architect or anything like that so yeah we are here to work with you um and through with this process so anything to add that's good good becomes better all right beautiful and so there can be some other complicating factors involved in dealing probably once you carry as well with um with mining subside and so it's sometimes external agencies that need to also approve development applications as well isn't there okay our next question is do counsel rfs jump in for a sec before you before you do that yeah definitely um I just wanted to also mention that if it's a really uh complex bushfire scenario um uh new south wales royal fire service our assessment teams uh you know they can also uh meet and do a pre-da service with the bushfire consultant and the client as well um so there is that as well if you want to just have a double check with rural fire service before you go through the process for very great to know lisa I think we do have a couple of those who get towards ga so we'll keep that in mind dumb track definitely um our next question is do council rfs or consultants believe the bushfire inquiry from 2019-20 will impact or change current bail specifications or create or offer implications or improvements for property bushfire certifications I'll jump in and start if you like yes it will and I can tell you right now that uh several of the recommendations there is currently work going on uh within the department of planning rural fire service and a few other agencies to actually try and come up with better policy and processes uh in order to from a strategic level all the way down to your individual property site level to to try and take what we've learned from the previous fires and ensure that we're building back better to protect our communities I think if if I can jump in there and follow on from lisa it's um it's a very slow process it's not a new south wales levels it's it's within a national framework so the building code of australia the national construction code the australian standard for construction of bushfire um construction of houses in bushfire prone areas is where it all comes from and the the process to change that is quite slow so to actually change the building code um is at least 18 months there's got to be quite a involved process from the various states and territories to actually put forward proposals for change so it's not like a very quick thing so when we're talking about bells so the the rural fire service department planning councils can do things around local environment plans and development control plans and sort of things that are within their control um but the the bowels is a difficult thing so they'd probably be consideration of climate change you know what drives some some of those things what you know is the current fire danger ratings the right level so you probably won't see change in that space very quickly but as lisa says that there's a lot drives that um at a national level so you're getting national consistency that's great thank you lou and lisa okay okay we were asked to clear all trees up to 54 meters in order to rebuild why are the existing non-burnt homes allowed to keep their trees which are close to their homes that were not destroyed it's a very specific question it might be a difficult answer without seeing nothing I can I can have a crack at that yeah yeah correct I love it have a go so 54 is a very specific number and I've just had a look in planning for bushfire protection so that is potentially forest vegetation on zero to five degree slope which gives you about 12.5 so that becomes the the piece about someone being required to clear um I i don't think there's any provisions that council or the rural fire service or others would say you must do these things you must clear the trees um where someone is looking at situating the house the bushfire attack level so if it's about 12.5 asset protection zones so there's a standard around that and that standard would say that you need to manage the canopy trees and the mid-story and the ground story vegetation in a certain way um the other thing to bear in mind is and I think I said this at the start of my presentation this is for all new development so the trigger is you're submitting a da or you're making some sort of formal change so there's a that there's a slow burn here in terms of changing the resilience of the interface over a very long time people can use the guidelines to say I'm in bowel fame zone and I want to put an asset protection zone in and create additional clearing or you know manage the fire but there's a couple of different processes so existing legacy houses that there's no requirement until they actually formally start the process when you start the process the new standards all come into play so you're getting that increasing resilience you know over a much longer time frame so was really good thank you that was I learned something though that was great um so that's pretty much it for the questions that we have up so far are we actually doing one more bear with us while we have a quick look uh here we go sorry one last one given that most of us may purchase existing properties rather than new builds what affordable and accessible tools and services are available to inform potential buyers of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with a particular property I should have worn my glasses today happy to jump in again yeah go for it anyone else um lisa mentioned the um household assessment kit um the rural fire service have so that that's something that people can use themselves to get a bit of an idea of it um if people get that wrong if you call it woodland instead of forest or whatever it is you'll throw the the calculations in terms of what the bowel levels are out massively um so I think that's where you know lisa had said quite correctly and catherine actually understands how to determine about levels it is probably the way to go um I think uh quite a lot of bushfire consultants out there would provide due diligence reports so give you an indication of what the bushfire attack level is to inform people so we do a lot of that um so people are making sort of that informed decision around what the bushfire attack level is going into it um the the rural fire service also have and you might want to correct me here lisa the household assessment tool um so there's an online tool that the rfs have that people can step through what their own circumstances are that sort of tell them what the risk is and you can tweak the tool and change different aspects of it to change the level of risk um so that gives you you know what you can reasonably do around the house and manage the landscape and gardens and things like that so there's a couple of options there that people can use that's that's correct there are a lot of tools in my slides so please feel free to use those um I would also uh recommend that when you are purchasing an existing property you ensure that you get the certificate it's a 10.7 right council um and that will actually tell you uh whether the property has bushfire prime land or fl or flood prone land um and that's a really good way you know you can use that then go on again I had a link in my talk about a spatial viewer you can actually go on and have a look at all those hazard layers in there um just to give yourself uh you know a bit of an idea uh the thing is just because your property has a classification of bushfire prone land that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be you know the end of the world so it's better to actually go and have a look and see what that property has associated with it and then for yourself you know weigh up the risks that you're comfortable with as well but please make sure you on the rfs website uh you know to try and assist you and then you know if you do have an existing site uh an existing home and you're just not sure where to start with your bush fire protection measures reach out to your volunteer rural fire service brigades and see if they can actually give you some help so that you know to to guide you in the right direction because your local bushfire brigades those volunteers you know they're local to your area they understand what the landscape is like what the bushfire is like and they can really be an a huge asset um to talk to to to just appreciate what kind of things you can do uh around your home to make it you know bushfire ready um and there are some other community engagement programs from rural fire service which uh the volunteers may also be able to hook you up with in terms of understanding how better to just do general maintenance around your home to ensure it is you know better protected whether it be doing modifications to the drastically reduce the risk thank you lisa I was going to say the same thing so I'm a community engagement officer with my local rfs brigade and be more than happy at any time to take a call from community and come out and have a chat as I'm sure all of our brigades across the southern highlands would be as well um and we also have some really great volunteers in our wallendally support brigade who do that work as well so yeah definitely contact your local resources and um and we're more than happy to have those conversations there's a very useful document that the rfs has as well called building best practice upgrades and if you have a building that was built prior to bushfire protection measures being required it is a pretty good document on what measures you might be able to take to improve your building's ember protection and you can easily apply it to any house so that's another one it's the building best practice upgrade document thank you catherine that's great jody ah yeah I actually do consult an architect uh prior to buying the 10.7 certificate actually comes with all your sales contract so you could easily just throw that off to your architect or you know in this instance me and they could advise you order risk of having a house in a bushfire prone area the good news is majority of houses in bow 29 and lower if they're not bushfire resilient they could easily be retrofitted to meet the new clothes that's not really going to cost you an arm and a leg so jody some of the things that we get questions about sometimes from people might be around shutters and windows and doors um solar panels whether or not they can or can't have solar panels depending on their bushfire ratings are they the sort of questions that they could take to an architect as well yes yes we would guide you for all the different construction codes what you can do and it's very similar to my presentation when you're putting fire shutters on your external windows and the code says you're go out and get any mesh panel if there are regulations around it and when you're buying your windows and things that retrofit we could guide you around which codes to look for and what you have to be compliant to thank you jody okay we have a question in the chat as well which is around when neighbouring properties might have dangerous trees and um is there any assistance that council rfs can provide um so to encourage or to support with resolving the issue of dangerous trees on neighbouring properties and then um sort of along the end of the lines of that question too if they need to move their building envelope to get away from trees on neighbouring properties can cancel support throughout that process it might be a treated situation yeah I think if it's okay I think it might be one better to be asked to be answered after a bit more research so I'm more than happy to help if we can get the address in that sort of thing about that for sure there's a big site specific in that one so yeah happy to park that if you'd like to email through a bit more information on your property and their contact number and which shy you're from more than happy to walk you through that process that's not working for so yeah and possibly the bushfire consultant to look at the building envelope as well yeah is that right yeah okay great thank you I think we've got another question okay great I think we have answered all the questions um I'm just going to we now have we've got graham mcguigan here online thank you for joining us so quickly here's the manager members of member service for master builders association in new south wales graham has managed the member services department for the past 13 years and has been instrumental in enhancing member benefits and the development of new services in the past five years he's also accepted the responsibility of overseeing the eight regional offices throughout new south wales prior to joining the master builders association he has held senior management roles with repco trade spent more than 30 years in senior management roles with the building and construction industry so over to you graeme if you're ready yes I am thank you um I wasn't sure whether or not that was about me or someone else there um okay so look I'm the manager for member services for the master builders association I um I manage the services department a little bit about the master builders a little bit of history I suppose the association is the oldest registered industrial instrument in australia we've been around for quite a while 148 years and our first meeting was held in the city of sydney in a hotel of all places in 1873 and that was november I believe next slide thanks can't actually see the slides green would you like us to share your slides yes please that's um that's how I thought it was gonna be done they're just bringing those slides up for you now graham won't be a second great thank you just bear with us graham we're just having a few's all good now I've um I'll actually I've covered off that first first part there um is that natalie or kimono dealing with all right so we're about to be located well we're located throughout throughout the state we have 10 offices two of which are in the metropolitan area forest lodge basically houses our all our service departments excluding two which are our training and also our apprenticeship services and they reside at northwest in the business park out in the western suburbs of sydney so all the service other service departments and the master builders are actually housed in forest lodge and they um service our our members which total a little over 8 000 8038 with the specialist services they require or other locations that you can see there we're located in aubry uh where ballina to the north gosford newcastle orange port macquarie aladola and in particular with um relevant to the presentation today the ola dollar office was highly instrumental in the bushfires that occurred down the south coast south of nara right down to the victorian border services they provided locally and how the community tapped into them if we could go to the next slide thanks so the sectors that we service throughout the building construction industry they include residential and the residential sector is um includes your builders and trade contractors that um that produce and renovate new dwellings and also renovate them the commercial sector these are generally larger companies that have high dollar turnover projects and a lot of them are federally funded state government and then you have the other private sector funded projects that happen in that area some of those contracts may include projects such as hospitals schools roadways railways etc all those infrastructure projects the commercial sector are heavily engaged in specialist contractors we also include in there the contractors that service civil projects and civil projects are usually those projects that I fall into that rail road etc area tunnels a lot of the tunnels around the sydney there are they're certainly produced by principal contractors commercial but they also include the specialist trades in that civil sector services sector um pretty self-explanatory there from the notes exactly what they are they produce something for the builders all the people engaged in the building industry that provide the plans designs building consultants that provide either professional or expert witness for for clients suppliers and manufacturers um that's everyone from your local mitre tents through the bunnings and anyone that's producing products locally in australia and sourced from overseas that actually uh want to be members of the association other this is a smaller sector and you'll see in the following slides some numbers around that but generally these are people that want to stay connected with the industry or there are apprentices and students that look towards us to uh for professional support and information next one please next slide so our members what do they look like well by the sector you can see they're from 5010 in our residential sector now these are 5 000 individuals they're not actually numbers of people in the businesses these are just one business one member one record so as you can see there that is very high as far as our member base of these a small business the other 20 is made up of your medium to larger project home builders but the 3 000 of those small mom and dad builders that I would refer to them as that you would see in your local areas with the utes running around the around the neighborhood the commercial sector 285 members um that might surprise some people but commercial by itself by definition is high dollar volume project work um and there certainly aren't as many projects in the commercial sector as to what they are start in the residential residential builds over the last 12 months a total around about 38 40 000 sorry 38 to 40 000 projects per annum so as you can see the residential requires a lot more people in that area to perform that work commercial they are very large builders tier ones there are only about 10 to 12 of these federally and they're accredited to be able to perform and tend to work for the federal government the next category gown will classify them as tier two builders they can tend to your tier threes generally cover off private projects and local government projects 1548 specialist contractors these are individual trades that service the industry and a lot of those mainly fall within that civil sector so they could be anything from bridge builders to post tensioning for bridge they could be rail specialists all a particular area that services the industry 1548 you'll find a lot of these also on commercial projects 388 members in the services sector these are people that want to connect with our member base and provide services to them such as architects designers building consultants we have 156 suppliers and manufacturers and 651 upon me that fall into the other category being the apprentices excuse me students um honorary members and we also have some retired members about 30 or 40 that just want to stay connected with the industry next slide please the service departments that make up the master builders so we have the department that I look after which is member services member is a bit of a conduit really we um we're the first port of call generally for members service or need to have someone speak to them from the specialist departments that we have but generally we're the first port of call for the public and they come through to us seeking information such as where can I get a master builder member to do some work for me or I have a project whereby I want to make sure that the person that we're doing with them is licensed sometimes we're confused with fair trading who actually issue the licenses but we're quite happy to help people out with that search from the public the work health safety department we have six specialist staff in that area that spend the majority of their time on site and assisting members ensure compliance around work health and safety and we work very closely with safework new south wales to ensure that um that our builders and their projects that they're doing and the people that are on their sites are actually compliant and safe a workplace relations department this is um probably a fancy name for industrial relations the old terminology they uh they might relate to putting in place an enterprise bargain agreement for them these are generally commercial larger builders that employ a lot of staff uh award interpretation and they also conduct contractor audits on behalf of those federal and state government commercial projects whereby they need to ensure that the contractors working on site actually have all their paperwork in place and can perform the work insurance department we have our own brokerage which is master builders insurance brokerage education and skills development this is our training resource center out at northwest this can provide qualification trade qualifications much the same as tafe professional development and any short courses that that are required to run their business also located as I mentioned before on that site at northwest is our apprenticeship services department so we actually engage 280 apprentices that we host through industry so that they can get their practical experience but there are actual qualifications are conducted on site at the education and skills development area so that gets them their third three qualifications that can depend upon the trade they do can lead to them also participating a leasing facility or finance also a car search for our members so we're connected through the financial services area with a partnership with macquarie bank uh our events marketing and sponsorship that's uh that's about all the uh events that we put on to either educate our members or provide products and services in front of them and our administration area which manages all our money next slide thanks so our partners who we work closely with well as I mentioned previously we worked very closely with safe work new south wales in the services new south wales area we're working now with with the resilience department fair trading where we talk to them on a regular basis particularly when we're dealing with continuous professional development and licensing questions with fair trading icare which looks after the um home warranty insurance that our brokerage has a relationship with long service leave corporation so that our industry can actually connect and provide themselves with long service and the vocational and education and training accreditation board um v tab where we have our scope of qualifications have a very close relationship is also mates in construction mates provide a suicide prevention and counselling service to the industry that anyone in the industry can connect with and finally these are a um a work um rehabilitation service they also will do inspections on um clients uh office space to see whether or not in fact they're set up with the correct ergonomics and they also provide counselling as well on the next slide so who turned to us in times of need so our customers the general public would be um particularly in these areas where we have natural disasters new our phones usually ring quite quite hot at the time small business owners these these are don't necessarily have to be associated with the industry but will also come to us for assistance with the ward and rates of pay and things of that nature predominantly our members certainly our members rely on us for the services to ensure that they are compliant with legislation and that they are up to date with all the new products and installation techniques and the technical assistance mcc or bca and industry standards and tolerances in the performance of their trade principal contractors engaged to manage projects and I'll talk specifically later about one of those principal contractors that was involved with the bushfires insurance council of australia turned to us particularly in these times where we have natural disasters to look towards us to develop expression of interest interest within the industry with contractors who they can get hold off quickly that want to actually perform that work and services new south wales which I've mentioned before and quite a few departments that we we um that we work with very closely next slide so what can we do well um probably the um the best one that I could talk to would be um what we did with with lango o'rourke who were the principal contractor and they were engaged to as part of the cleanup um clean up the new south wales bushfires so we actually um provided free of charge to lango rock our office amenities down in the aladola area and that included meeting rooms for their project and lunch and things of that nature and full use of our communications through internet and phones lange o'rourke_``_10039.52 took um took residence in our office there from february um 2020 through to october 2020. they had four staff permanently on site and now other dollar office and a host of supervisors who were in and out of the place on a regular basis and they had 24-hour access to that office if required so that's um that's certainly one of the big areas that when we have these things that occur throughout the state whether it be floods or fires that we can actually play a very active part in that we also assist um enquiries for local trade contractors uh provide the insurers as I mentioned before with contractor contacts compile those expression of interest databases for them and keep members um updated on what those local issues are particularly with those fires down there so that everyone was some uh kept well and truly up to date with um what was in front of them all right so some of our contacts which I've we had lynn smith who's our regional coordinator for the southern highlands shoalhaven and snowy mountain chiros the contact numbers are there on the screen for you lee tanks is our original coordinator based in illawarra his patch comes a little bit down towards that now and he had some crossover there as well and my contact details should anyone need them at all they're also available there and that is about me natalie thank you guys sorry I'll jump in there thanks graeme thank you very much for that really appreciate um we there is a question in the chat for you um let me just jump into that um is it can a non-member of the public contact master builders association with any inquiries absolutely we're quite um quite often we'll fill uh questions from non-uh that actually work in the trade that um or work in the industry that are trying to source information we're quite happy to provide that for them but the difference between that individual and someone who's a member they will get as much support or actually able to contact and speak with the actual service departments so they generally log with me as well great excellent so if anybody needs to they've got their contacts there and everything will be all these presentations and everything will be available on council's website so people will be able to access that information so um so if anybody's got any further questions for our group of panelists here today please pop them in the question and answers and the chat and we can send them through to get some answers for you I'll cross over to you nat and corrine thank you thanks kim one thing I just wanted to mention so I did briefly touch before on the recovery support service um so I do have tanya and ray online today and tanya might just get you to pop your team's details in the chat so as I mentioned before the recovery support service I've kind of introduced them when I talk to residents about them being the disaster recovery personal assistants so they've walked with us in wall and case management support and well-being support to individuals in both world and deli and widget caribbea throughout throughout the last two years thankfully they've just been refunded under a new block of funding through the southwest sydney local health district so they'll be around for another 12 months which is fantastic um so if anyone ever wants support with navigating this process it can be really really overwhelming to go through this process and as karine touched on before for a lot of people they never planned on building a house or didn't plan on building a house um under these circumstances or right now so tanya rayleen michelle and alison are a great support and they they can be there to walk through that process navigate that process share their contacts and their their knowledge that they've gained they've seen it all in the last couple of years whether it's insurance issues rebuild issues well-being issues um obviously this is a very traumatic event so they know of all the different services out there financial counsellors the different grants that are available the people it'll be the first time ever needing to access those supports and services so please feel free to contact either tanya or myself or korean council at any point in time or we could link you in with not only the recovery support but some of those other supports that are out there as well and help you walk through that process as well the planning teams from both councils when it does come time to launch those days and to build um I'm just very quickly going to share a slideshow about what's happening in bollingely since since the fires um so my role with council is a community recovery officer so I started with council um august following the bush wise august 2020 and sorry this is just not playing nicely for me here uh started in august 2020 following the bushfires and have been now working through council with council through a number of disaster events so um I'm just going to talk to you a little bit about what we have in place as council as recovery some of the things things that we're doing on an ongoing basis as well so as we mentioned before um stephen and jake mentioned that we have our activate while in dealing 2021 long-term recovery and resilience plan so these plans not only looking at our recovery following the green waddle creek bushfire um but also the subsequent disaster events are now covered 19 as well so um we hear it a lot but the the 2019 25s were unprecedented in a lot of ways uh we've seen severe bushfire events in the past but this one went for a very long time and it impacted such a huge part of the country at one time and then we had unfortunately covered 19 starting just after a flood event in between in our shire so stephen and jake did touch on this a little bit before as well but the impact for bolindilli was significant and winter caribbean so right on the border of wall and jelly and winter caribbean boxton we did lose two rfs volunteers which had a significant impact on all of the shire um we lost 19 homes huge number of outbuildings so 66 our buildings destroying 45 damaged I have a feeling that number's probably much higher a lot of people don't reach out for support so we don't hear a lot about a lot of things um 1276 kilometers of fencing and we know that people are still having issues with replacing fencing now used down the track so the impact was just huge across our shire we actually had the fourth highest burn scar in australia throughout that period so council obviously play a role in in response as well so councils in partnership with state and federal government are responsible for contributing to the safety and well-being of communities by participating in local emergency management and recovery efforts so what a lot of people probably um don't understand I know I didn't until I came on to council was that council plays a really active role in the local emergency management committee and council staff are quite often in those emergency operation control centres during disaster events so it has uh council play a really important role in not a disaster event as well so here in wellington 2016 we're impacted by a major flood event and it was a devastating event for our community and really highlighted for the need for council to really have strong disaster recovery and preparedness frameworks in place so there's a lot of community consultation following those floods a lot of deliberative engagement stations with community that were facilitated by external disaster recovery experts and from there we developed our activate wall and jelly framework and it's that framework that's guiding our recovery from the the green water creek bushfire so I won't go into too much detail but here's a little bit about our activate well and julie framework and that first slide is recovery commences when response commences and so straight away when we have a disaster of any wall in july we really try and quickly set up community recovery information centers to give out that information and information try and link people into those supports and the services that are operating in the area and we we've done that recently following the it partnered up with a number of services who also support community during disaster recovery and a huge thank you to the services that involved in that process our mayoral relief fund which comes into play following a significant disaster event so during the green water creek fire I'll touch a little bit down track but that was a huge um donations from community come in and then council can pass that money out to impacted residents and it really made a huge difference during the fires we so appreciate the support that came from community during that event and we've also been able to use funding to support our thermal storm impacted residents as well so the community recovery information centres I touched on we also have a local recovery and resilience committee so that committee has been in place for a very long period of time so following that 2016 flood or storm it doesn't always meet on an ongoing basis so during the fires we actually were unable to um actually able to reinstate that committee um before it was uh in december so but prior to the fire impacting bustin embargo so we were straight away able to have that committee up and going so we had that community representation about what the needs were in community and a really broad cross-section of community working together to support the community through that recovery process and we're still meeting now um two years on from the fire we meet bi-monthly now that um the work isn't as urgent in nature but we're still always focusing on those ongoing needs in community and adapting to those ongoing needs to say change and also looking at how we can work together with communities as how council can work together with different community organizations to plan for a stronger response in the future and also our preparedness as well so we have a number of um preparedness tools so we have uh our get ready well and daily website and there's a lot of information on our website too around preparing for disaster we're doing things all the time like partnering with rfs and ses so we have two get ready workshops are in partnership with new south wales rfs mscs and also the red cross so they're really exciting and deliberative engagement so that's something that we've committed to do following all disaster events which is really the chance for us to engage with community talk about what worked and what didn't work and we've done a lot of that since the fire so we had two series of community forums that were held by or hosted by and led beta who's a disaster recovery expert and will be speaking for us on sunday so she's been a part of our recovery journey from the early days so um and she facilitated those sessions which gave us some really great feedback around what has and hasn't worked for our communities following the 2019-20 bushfires uh and how we can improve our response and the things that we need to do a lot of that information has already gone into planning for some of our grant applications and some of our future project work and we will be using continuing to use that information happening within council about our response during the fires and then also looking at ways for us to improve practice going forward training it will deliver for staff and our different grant projects that we have as well so as I mentioned before so recovery commits is when response commences so I won't go into too much of this I have touched on it already but um yeah so everything from our outdoor staff we're on the ground during fires clearing trees clearing roads reopening roads we're opening public spaces that recovery and resilience committee and our recovery information points as you can see during the 2019-25s they happened right before christmas as you all know so we're able to um be a donation point for um for presence and give those out to community which is great but that's one of the areas that we're really looking to improve on moving forward and partnering with groups like give it to manage our donations so we can improve that community information's recovery information point process and partner with existing services in the community extremely generous following the green waddle creek bushfire we had around 454 thousand dollars of donations that came in which is incredible um absolutely amazing and 186 individuals or families were supported through that mass relief fund 100 of all donated funds were distributed so that's really huge and you can see some of the things that it helped out with there whether it was clean up replacing white goods clothing bedding all those things that people just hadn't planned for that they needed support with tools so that our our trade construction is obviously a huge industry for will and dilly a lot of our tradesmen lost tools or trailers and vehicles so the mayor's really fun could even help with helping those small business operators get up and going it was just amazing and the impact of that funds was huge so the activate wall and daily plan looks at four different elements of recovery so economic recovery social recovery built recovery and natural recovery so it really spans all of our council teams and it's uh it's it councils are huge organizations different departments so obviously build recovery with our planners our certifiers our strategic planners recovery with our environment teams so we we're not only looking at things like the grants that we're giving out the grants we're applying for sometimes for community projects but sometimes there are things you don't see around managing vegetation regenerating the environment that was impacted by the fires and a lot of really great projects going on with our environment team our economic recovery so during our planning for economic recovery it's really about getting business back up and going so with our grant projects we try to encourage the the funding to be if there's services being purchased so for example we gave out funds for regeneration to residents so we set criteria that encourages spending with local businesses and obviously we can support through tourism and development as well we've been successful with a number of large grants through the bushfire local economic recovery fund that will encourage tourism and spending it with our local businesses in social recovery that comes down to a lot of some of that is supporting the not-for-profit organizations in the area and the work that they do and trying to provide them with funding or resources or knowledge that can help them to deliver services it's around providing that well-being support sometimes ourselves so um karen and I we do a lot of work going out with residents so for us ourselves we try and go out but we're also trying to link people into services so really getting to know our communities what their needs are so we can make sure that appropriate service providers and community groups are up and going in our communities and we can link people in and that we're communicating and working together as well um social cohesion is a huge role in in how communities recover from disaster so a community that is well connected and has good social cohesion can bounce back faster so what we're trying to do is even things like planning events just to provide some fun and some opportunities for social connection following the natural disaster and that's been even more critical in of the little things that we did at council that has just been one of the things that I've enjoyed the most is linking our residency with our community nursery so there's been a huge amount of grief for our residents with the the impact that the fires have had on the natural environment around their properties and we're now seeing that with the thermis storm event as well where people move toward dealing because they love the beautiful natural environment the trees the plants the wildlife and it's something that they're used to having and it also provides uh privacy and security around people's blocks as well so when we have an event like the floods or the fires it really impacts that natural environment the wildlife the ecosystems and it's really a big source of greece so it's been nice for us at our nursery to be able to give out some native plants to people to help regenerate their gardens we've also tried to do that in partnership with picton rotary as well with giving out some vouchers of our very lovely bush fire impacted residents coming down to collect some native plants preparedness is obviously a huge part of the community recovery officer role that karin and I both do with council and we are really I know for me it's becoming a big focus we're in bushfire in storm season at the moment so just trying to get the message out around preparedness so this was a recent campaign that we did in partnership with the new south wales rfs which is around bushfire preparedness and just some get ready street banners that we developed that we have up in embargo tarmal and picton we're hoping to get some more of these banner polls so that we can start to do more community awareness work I'm looking forward to partnering with the scs and doing some storm and flight preparedness campaigns as well uh we have a mobile recovery and resilience hub project which we've received funding for and that will involve outreach work across all the towns of wallander and really providing capacity building and resilience building opportunities education around and our partnerships with rfs and ses and red cross will be critical with projects like that and as you can see we're signed up to the resilience new south wales get ready council project as well so we try and share a lot of social media messaging around getting ready for disaster too another project that we've um very happy to be a part of which is resilience new south wales lead is the disaster dashboard so we need to carry we also have a dashboard so this is a project for us um we're about to go live with um we're due go live three weeks but we've been a little bit um we've shifted really into recovery mode which has just set us back launching this but so our disaster dashboard is something that brazilians new south wales have developed for councils across new south wales and it's designed just to be that one stop point for information during disaster events so it draws information automatically from new south wales ses new south wales rfs fire and rescue so we information we're not having to go out and do our own posts it's really about creating a central point where people can access to get information directly from the response agencies and those combat agencies like rfs ses fire and rescue new south wales health department of prime industries um so this is a project that we're really looking forward to sharing with the community hopefully in the next two weeks um and that will be on our website for every everybody to access it also have live traffic conditions as well so and we're just working really to um to make sure that all those road closure informations that are critical for us um as we all know we um during evacuation during the fires there was some issues around roads and getting people out quickly so we want this to be a place where we'll hopefully be able to look for that live traffic information and get that really quick information there as well so there's just a few of the different projects that which that we're working on from the uh winter carry are going to share some more information about what they're doing um in tomorrow's session as well which will be really great uh but we're really excited to be partnering with the nwra and winter caribbean council and obviously resilience new south wales who support the community recovery officer position and the recovery support service uh it's really a team effort in wall and dilly and we do caribbean to support the community through disaster events in recovery and um and and preparedness work as well so today's session is really a great opportunity for us to look at our built resilience and how we can uh build better or build back better or improve the our existing properties to make them more fire resistant so thank you so much to all of our speakers today the information has been absolutely invaluable and we really look forward to having this as a resource on our website going forward because I think it's going to be just invaluable for people who are going through that process so if anybody's got any chat or they can email them through to either um natalie corrine or myself um auto thrive council and uh and then we can go back and uh and get those relevant questions answered for you so um thank you again for all our speakers today is there anything that any of you would like to include don't all good wonderful so everybody who has been on today there is links on the council website to their agencies and their contact details so you can access all of that information on there so thank you very much to everybody who's come along today and who's participated and taken part in this um very much appreciated very much appreciated to the um well and dilly I t team who have uh brought this together as well so we had a couple of glitches but that's just normal in this platform now in this day in life we're all we're all learning to adapt to things like this so thank you everyone and we look forward to hopefully seeing you online for our saturday and sunday'll see you tomorrow morning thank you bye everybody thank you you
Good morning everyone this is the wrap-up of the October council meeting today it's actually raining out there so that's what are the most exciting things to tell you about at the council meeting on Monday night we talked about the voluntary planning agreement up at Marsh Road at Silver Dollar and finally that whole program is in place we talked about Elton Dale and the need not to have the 9,000 houses go ahead there talked about the possibility of maybe putting some agriculture in that particular visit area there was an application some time ago about West Tamil and it talked about land size we actually developed some land size we thought was suitable and they came back asking for smaller councillors stuck to what it originally said we looked at an eco-tourism site out on Barker's Lodge Road and while councils really proactive about the ecotourism we're just worried about some technicalities and we've deferred it until we get those sorted out one of the most exciting things was there as an expansion of our operational plane so there's a whole extra sections of roads and I'm sure everybody will appreciate that we had notices of motions that covered the raising of the dam wall people are concerned about the construction going on and also about the loss of our indigenous artworks up there we've had to walk right to the state government we were undergoing in new LEP but our concern is that once we've developed that the state government push us outside what we've decided so we've asked them to confirm that they'll back us up once we've done the work we talked about the koalas and there's a little bit of pork barreling going on and the Labour government have said they'll have a koala National Park we've asked them to confirm exactly what they mean and exactly over what areas at the moment it looks like it doesn't extend into the wall and Dilli but we're asking them to go that bit further down Ellen's Creek we talked about go get cars orange council has put some council cars out that people can use going to talk to orange council and also the person that started going to get cars one of our major concerns is about harvestable water most people would think that if water fell into your damn it was your water and you could use it but for our farmers they have limitations on what they can actually use government set these limitations and we don't want them to be novels by government when we're especially in a drought situation so in all a great October meeting and we look forward to bringing you than November wrap up thank you

throughout the state which assist communities on the bushland urban interface in preparing their homes and also having the right knowledge and behaviors to help during major bushfire emergencies fire and rescue new south wales exists for the same reason all the other emergency service agencies and functional areas in emergency management to protect the irreplaceable and we're learning more and more that we have to be prepared for anything what governs what we do is the legislation that oversees it so that's the fire rescue new south wales act 1989 and state rescue and emergency management act 1989 which gives us a leading in our hazardous materials responsibility fire rescue new south wales is responsible for all fire districts across the state and that represents 90 percent of the population and 10 of the land mass across the state fire rescue new south wales is responsible for hazardous materials response across the state including inland waterways fire rescue new south wales um during the last five years has developed what we call the plus plan and it's all of the combat areas that and capabilities that we've developed number one has to be prevention because as with all emergency service agencies we're far better off to prevent than have to respond to any of the actions and that requires a culture change because emergency responders are driven and culturally do lead towards responding to those emergencies so we are responsible for firing fire district and we were supported by the new south wales rural fire service we're a rescue agency with over 100 accredited rescue capabilities across the state and as I said the hazmat combat agency which we work closely with the environmental urban search and rescue response and we have that capability both at a state national and international level we assist the police in counterterrorism and support in the area of hazardous materials and chemical biological radiological requirements and assist the ambulance in medical response with 13 community first responder stations across the state fire rescue are focusing on prevention activities we are elevating that as with a higher importance in response to change the culture to make sure that we can implement our programs across the state such as fire ed safety visits installing smoke alarms working smoke alarms in all properties within new south wales with the empire district making sure people have the safe practices and we do things such as our winter fire safety campaign with great little programs such as keep looking while you're cooking barbecue safety winter fire safety keeping everything a meter from the heater ovulated power boards we also work very closely in the structural fire safety area with the building commissioner and a national construction code to ensure that our buildings are safe that includes working with developers and local government such as the cladding risk which we saw through the grenfell disaster and other emergencies our buildings will be safer into the future allowing us more time to spend on our prevention activities preparedness is one of the most important things we can collectively do as emergency management including the combat agencies and the functional areas fire rescue new south wales has a position on all tiers of the emergency management committees both at the state regional and local level that also includes bushfire management committees rescue management committees in the whole raft under the state emergency rescue management act fire rescue new south wales is also a member of the australasian fire and emergency services authority council known as apac which assists bringing all emergency service agencies together to make sure that we have effective community messaging in all types of emergencies such as flood and bushfire led by the rural fire service and the state emergency service fire rescue new south wales worked very closely with the new south wales rural fire service to maintain service delivery across the state this requires adjusting boundaries as areas develop and fire grass fire risk new south wales rural fire service is a combat agency supported by fire rescue new south wales and as the environment becomes an urban environment and transitions to fire rescue new south wales as fire rescue new south wales is a combat agency and supported by the new south wales rural fire service those arrangements are constantly updated to ensure that the communities of new south wales get the best possible response for the disaster of the emergency that's happening fire rescue new south wales have support roles in all the sub-plans under the em plans the emergency management plans and is the lead agency on hazmat and urban search and rescue plan as a wrap-up I believe the best thing that we can achieve is for all emergency services agencies and functional areas to prepare their communities for emergencies and when those emergencies occur for all the combat agencies and functional areas to come together seamlessly identifying the critical factors and manage them in the most appropriate and timely way possible the key to achieving this is for a well-practiced informed local regional and leah khan maria conan and sequon on the 16th to 12 2015 nine days out from christmas in kernel a mini tornado hit the community of colonel and I remember walking into the eoc and assistant commissioner from the police mick fuller was leading the charge he was leading the combat agencies and in the eoc down at sutherland there was a well-developed and thought out plan to get those communities back to as close to normal as possible before christmas fire rescue new south wales implemented their rapid disaster assessments identifying what the key risks and hazards that needed to be resolved the teams from the energy authorities the councils garbage removalists fire rescue new south wales hazmat teams and the ses storm and tempest team supported by the new south wales rural fire service methodically went through the streets making safe restoring power removing waste making asbestos safe to get the communities off canal ready for christmas which was greatly appreciated and the key to all this happening well was to make sure that the leader of that team knew what the critical factors were knew what the to do in a timely manner bringing all the resources together we are continually getting better at this the harmony between the teams and the functional areas is just getting stronger and stronger and with the introduction of resilience new south wales it's going to further enhance our capability to serve the communities of new south wales when emergencies and disasters hit them thank you we're here to protect what really matters I've been a really brave girl today yes we help anyone anywhere anytime strap on protects our net we are fire and rescue new south wales and we are prepared for anything thank you so much to assistant commissioner rob mcneil for that video and it's a really great video and just really highlights that need for collaboration in the space both during response and recovery uh just before I introduce and label I also just wanted to touch on the fact that today we will be covering a lot of content uh the things that we talk about and the imagery that you're going to see during this presentation may be quite flight or storm events that have happened subsequently or even um just given what we've been through through the kobe 19 pandemic so if there is anything today that makes you feel as though you would like some additional support kim has just popped in the chat some of the contact details to some of the local support agencies that are available if you do feel like having a chat with somebody after the session today so thank you kim for popping that information in the chat we would now like to welcome anne ledbetter to the expo in is going to be talking today about moving forward after disaster navigating medium to long-term recovery and care for self and others anne is an independent national consultant specialising in disaster recovery and community resilience

the community recovery handbook for the australian institute of disaster resilience anne lives in king league victoria and was awarded a medal of the order of australia for her work in the aftermath of the 2009 black saturday bushfires welcome in thank you thanks natalie and thank you very much everyone for having me here today um it's fantastic to join you and what a great event and a very timely event to be thinking about our long-term recovery and resilience at this stage so I'm very pleased to join you now my plan today was to have a bit of a chat to go through some some slides and have a bit of a presentation and then to pause about halfway through there's any questions or any comments that anyone would like to make uh and then to finish off with that with some hopefully some some helpful tips and um and ideas about how to navigate this this next part of the recovery journey so I'm going to share my screen um and use that to keep me on track so that I don't um wander from the from the story I wanted to tell you um okay so hopefully you're now seeing that um that opening slide if the technology uh gods are with us and thank you um and so sadly in our you know wide brand land we do have a lot of experience of disasters um we commonly experience um extreme weather events um flood storms cyclones droughts bushfires and and of course um we have a lot of chance certainly to practice our response to those and how we recover and more recently of course we've had this new challenge which is a global pandemic and I think it's really important for us always to remember that the communities that trail in terms of recovery because their recovery is happening in the midst of uh of course 19 and we really have no way of understanding just yet what the implications of that are the long-term implications except that we can be pretty certain that it's likely to slow recovery down um things that perhaps would normally happen in the first year or the first 18 months potentially haven't been able to occur because of the impacts of covert so I really want to encourage people to understand that this is quite an untested environment and if things feel really difficult it's probably because of that added complication so as natalie mentioned my own interest in recovery uh really got started back in 2009 when our community of kingland was impacted by the black saturday bushfires and I was working at local government at that time and was involved in supporting the recovery of our area and then went on to work as for state government and I've had a lot of time I guess over the past decade or so to think about recovery and it could be as complex and as difficult as it is and and maybe to try and come up with some ways that um both at the policy level but also at the practical community level it can be made a little bit more kinder and and more streamlined so I don't need to tell any of you this but it's worth noting for people who work in disasters to remember that first and foremost disasters are about people when we have a natural disaster there's a huge focus on the built environment um bridges and roads and houses and other buildings and that's those things are really important but they're mostly important because they matter to people uh so people that need to be at the center of all the decisions that get made uh all of the initiatives and programs that get established need to work for the people that they're intended to serve and that's sort of a key message I think that we need it's worth worth repeating now some of you may be familiar with this um handbook um and it's intended just to plot the kind of the journey of recovery if you like the the trajectory that people are likely to travel on after they've been impacted by an actual disaster and so in the early stages which I mean it's a long time ago now for all of you I know but those early stages we often see a sense of of heroism and a very strong sense of a cohesive community people all working together to be able to uh come through that those first early days lots of stories of um brave you know acts uh lucky escapes and a great sense of community supporting each other um and that period lasts while the researchers say for about one to three days I think it's usually about around about three weeks in our current um experience of disaster so for the first three weeks things go along and people are sort of swept along with the tide of all the activity that's happening um to support recovery at about the three week mark I think the enormity home and and quite commonly people experience a real um a really deep trough of frustration and disappointment and anger as they try and navigate the really complex process of recovery and and the researchers here note that that can go um that could take for between one and three years and so in many senses and your communities are sort of right in the middle of that um even though a lot of time has elapsed since the fires so um it's it's a really important to know that that this process happens regardless of how much help might be available or or even to some extent the degree to which you were impacted this recovery process um uh is is what everyone goes through and so uh I wanted to talk a little bit about how we navigate this sort of the latter part of this process uh with you today now many of you um sadly who have have first-hand impact first-hand experience of the impacts of high adrenaline and when we have a life-threatening experience our body produces adrenaline to enable us to cope adrenaline helps us to um run really fast to you know to mobilize our capability in our systems that we that we don't normally need to draw on uh high adrenaline um helps us to focus on what's in front of us shuts down our peripheral um processing our cognitive processing and it makes us focus on the matter at hand um it's a primitive response so adrenaline impacts our our reptile brain so a lot of what happens in adrenaline isn't our conscious responses to a situation it's very much instinctive when you hear a saber-toothed tiger growling in the jungle what happens next is fueled by adrenaline so it's a really useful process that our bodies go through when we're in when we're affected by a high risk like that but it does have its downside so adrenaline makes it really hard to take in and process information um a lot of people in impacted communities talk about uh bushfire brain or um or storm brain you know that that sort of fuzziness that goes along with having been affected your safety um and it's really frustrating because after a disaster there's all this information that you need to try and take in so it's a really a perfect storm in terms of not being able to get the clarity to think about what's happening because of the impacts of of the event so difficult to remember things as well uh lots and lots of information coming in but really hard to hold on to all the detail um adrenaline affects your decision making so it's hard to weigh up uh pros and cons or compare one course of action with another when you're experiencing high uh high adrenaline and and the other thing that can happen is that every decision seems equally important so something that in the overall scanner things probably doesn't matter that much can end up taking up a huge amount of your thinking time and you can find yourself mulling over um you know and worrying about decisions that really perhaps are not not so important uh adrenaline can impact your sleep so it can make it really and you find that you're sleeping all the time you sit down for five minutes and next minute you realise you've been asleep for for an hour so that is all part and parcel of this um of this adrenaline effect adrenaline makes it really hard to maintain a calm and even approach to life and so people can be feeling hyper vigilant they can be feeling like they're under threat all the time and adrenaline can change the way we relate socially we might become more impatient or we might become more withdrawn from other people so there can be a very definite effect on relationships in that high adrenaline state now the thing about high adrenaline is it's not meant to last so you go into high adrenaline in order to deal with a sudden threat um was that a tiger I heard growling yes it was I need to run you know that sort of really basic um instinctive response to danger um it comes and it's utilized by people in short sharp bursts and it's meant to fade away once that people can stay in high adrenaline for a really long time and and even when their adrenaline comes down it doesn't take much to push it back up again so what would normally be a minor you know inconvenience or a minor challenge can see people's adrenaline spike really high and put them back into that um into that sort of high adrenaline around state so so these are the sort of longer term implications of um of the disaster and the disaster recovery phase the other thing that's really worth noting is that the cumulative effect of what happens when there are subsequent traumas or subsequent impacts on the community so I know for many of you this will be you know particularly important to note because you will have had uh drought and then fire and then flooded now more recently storms and overland why this incredibly complex uh covered uh response so um in my mind I liken this the sort of cumulative trauma to to the barrel load of bricks and it's like each trauma puts a few more bricks in point that barrier can become impossibly heavy so finding ways to take a few of those bricks out from time to time is is really important to your long-term uh sustained recovery so it's also um important for us to understand that the grief experiences don't happen the same for everyone so there is a pattern to the way we grieve um and and the patterns there on the screen the stages of grief sometimes there's five stages sometimes some some researchers talk about seven stages but it doesn't really matter terribly much the main thing for us to understand is that each of these stages needs to be worked through um in order to be able to get to a point where you can live a life that you value once again so people who with the best of intentions encourage others not to be angry about the disaster or not to feel sad uh or you know or not to feel guilty are actually stalling that person's recovery because you do need to experience all of those emotions in order to be able's really important to find people who are comfortable with you going through these emotions and can support you to do that rather than encouraging you not to feel uh what you need to feel the other important one to note here is um is anger people will be very angry about what's happened and that anger can last for a long time but it is part of the response to a disaster event or an event that's that has uh disrupted people's lives and it's also very natural for people to feel guilty in the in the post-disaster environment so people can feel guilty because they still have their house while their friends and family may have lost their homes other people can feel guilty because their business is being impacted by the disaster and the recovery and um and they feel bad about worrying about that because other people have lost homes and perhaps even family members so we really need to be willing to meet people where they are in relation to these stages of brief and be accepting and kind when to always accurately predict where people are and what sort of emotions they might be experiencing the big drawback with this um this diagram is it's so neat um it's sort of made up of little boxes and arrows and it looks like a very predictable journey um but recovery isn't like that uh short-term recovery or even longer term recovery is complex and varied um so when you're thinking about this stuff it's great to think about the stages of brief but when you when you visualize them it's probably better to visualize them like this because this is really a much better more accurate representation of what recovery can feel like and there are a lot of snakes um a few ladders but quite a lot of snacks so uh yeah that might be a better way to put it in your mind in order to create some realistic expectation about what this experience is going to be so I just want to pause there and come back to you and stop sharing my screen for a moment so that we can um have any of your questions um answered and and see how we how we're traveling thanks so much ian great information in there and there's a lot for people to take on board so um very happy for anybody to put any questions or comments that they have in either the q a or in the chat section uh so then that way ann can answer those for you um probably uh you know one question in particular and I i know that you went over it is you know often we hear uh you know how come you know my neighbor won't um let's say you know move forward with something or clean something up or rebuild or do this or do that but it's also understanding that maybe they're not actually in that frame of mind yet but then they see another neighbor that may have lost everything and moving forward and building and then you also get between those different people is how come they're rebuilding and then I haven't or how come they're at this stage some of that if possible yeah certainly tim um it's probably one of the hardest things I think to to be in a recovering community and to see the recovery as you know rolling out at different rates for different people um and there are a myriad of reasons why um that happens but importantly if we sort of think about it in another way we can tend to think of people who've been impact impacted by disaster as all being the same because they've all been exposed to the same event so you know the people who um are affected by a particular cyclone or a storm or are on fire um there can be a tendency of this our couple those people have that in common and so therefore they're all at the same place uh in their recovery the fact is that we don't all go into a disaster on a level playing field so we take whatever's happening in our lives with us as we go into this experience and so for some people that might mean um that they have a disability or a chronic illness or someone might have um a relationship that's really struggling um or maybe um uh you know they've got some some mental health issues with depression so all of that stuff goes into the recovery experience with the people who've been affected and so when you think about it in that way it's less surprising that there's variation in the way people are recovering because then all of their situations are quite unique and so there might be some common patterns but there will also be people who are recovering at different rates compared to other people now this wouldn't matter too much except that being human beings we tend to judge ourselves by how other people are progressing and so it can become quite a worry that um I haven't applied for a building permit yet but my neighbour's frame is already going up you know or um it's going to be another two years before our house is finished um but other people are already moving into their home so so those of course everyone's situation is different and is unique so um and sometimes um change even positive change like deciding where to rebuild or what sort of house to build um and in fact even building the house uh that change can be perceived as as just more uncertainty you know more um more of things to cope with uh and so even though the outcome is positive the process can feel um like another few bricks in the barrow you know because it's it's more change that I need to try and manage and so sometimes we can see people feeling not quite ready to take that step I will talk a bit more about the timing of recovery in our second part but it's a really important thing for us to remember that even though we've had a common experience we're not always on and we don't experience it in the same way so that's going to have implications for the way we recover yeah very much so and that probably backs on what um you know both karin and for windjie caribbe there's only a small amount of people that have started to rebuild there's quite a substantial amount that haven't and maybe they're just not ready to maybe they um they just don't know where to start maybe they're just unsure what they they want to do so same as we know of some in uh well in dilly that now have decided to still keep their property like their block but they've decided to go somewhere else and and that's okay too that's whatever works works for them so yeah I think um we had everybody we have all of those decisions um being made in our community and the the thing about those decisions is they take time um it takes time to actually sit with this disaster experience and work out what it means for you um some people decide to stay but then as the next fire season comes around they decide they can't do that anymore and that's when they'll choose to move some people will rebuild their homes and then know so so there's all sorts of responses that we see um and what we have to know about those is that they are right for the people who are making them even though they might be um different choices from from someone else so um uh it's really important to know though that um that rushing that process um might seem logical but it doesn't actually end up with a better outcome so we really need to support people to take the time they need um to make the decisions that are right for them because um not doing that I think adds um you know significantly to the the difficulty of recovery yeah very much so you know as you said we don't know we don't know what else is happening in their life as well on top of you know uh losing their home or other things that may have happened as well so um and this may be something you may touch on later on so sorry if I'm jumping ahead but um probably another key issue that comes up through this in this space as well is that something you can always stop I i am going to mention that so we might talk about that as we do our second um yeah our second have you got any um questions that have come through to you we haven't had anything come through on the chat yet but I know that they were just a few questions that community had asked of me beforehand that couldn't jump on today so no no questions yet but um probably just to make the comment that those things don't even don't just apply to rebuilding homes it can also we're also seeing how that impacts with reaching forward for assistance and um yeah still meeting new people now after twice we have a new referral this month um as we approach the second anniversary and I think that's so important for people to consider too that their people are going to reach out for assistance in different ways and at different times throughout this journey as well and I just want to really let people know reached out to council for assistance or hasn't reached out to the services that that we're all still here we're still happy to hear from people that we haven't had contact with yet yeah we have got a question in there at the moment and so we've just been asked is there a point or a stage where someone needs to be pushed if they appear stuck yeah um I think probably um if if it seems like someone's wanting to progress with their recovery and is not able to that's a time when services um kim like yours and and the services council provide can be really useful because sometimes it's a small thing you know sometimes it's just one little thing that might be actually preventing that that progress and people might just need the chance to talk that through um I think um one of the the hard things about grief is um we tend to subconsciously uh allocate an appropriate amount of time for people to grieve um so you know it's sort of and it than just sort of an instinctive feel it's like well it's been 12 months you know um they probably should be filling the jobs here or um it's been 18 months since that thing happened so how come they're not at this stage you know so so we can apply our own sort of um ideas about progress um which which may or may not reflect what a person is actually experiencing so um I think the best thing is to check in and say how are you traveling is through anything that's giving you a particular amount of trouble or you know is there anything you'll provide for finding to be particularly difficult and how can I help with that you know because sometimes it is I'm breaking those sort of roadblocks down into small manageable parts and getting a couple of things over the line and then suddenly progress can start again so but listening um is so important and really listening to hear where people are at not just uh listening to have our assumptions confirmed if I can put another question come through maybe this may be something you're going to to cover but I'll cover this now so um we've got a comment here where I recall a situation after ash wednesday when a young boy tried burning his house down because it was one of the only three that had survived any suggestions on how to make those who have not lost something feel included especially young people yeah it's such an important topic and such a um a tragic example you know of of of a young person who can't reconcile their place within their community the way that they were able to do before the disaster so disasters are inherently unfair um that that's what we know that's the common characteristic there's nothing fair about being involved in a disaster and yet we seek to make them fair um but as part of human nature and so we feel very uh uncomfortable with the idea that there are people who are worse effective worse or less affected and we're looking to try and make that equal so I think sometimes people who have what is sort of um euphemistically called survivor guilt that is they've survived the disaster relatively unscathed um it can be really helpful to remind them that more homes lost doesn't make anyone's life easier you know so um just because someone um hasn't lost their home um they ought not to feel guilty because in essence fewer homes being damaged or impacted actually means that recovery may well be a bit more um straightforward but again feeling guilty is something that people need to be able to sit with and make sense of and then move through and be supported to do that so it's it's no good saying well it wasn't your fault so why do you feel guilty or I think it's more important to say um if you had lost your house it wouldn't make anyone else's journey easier you know that idea that that um that more people um being negatively impacted doesn't actually make for a better outcome and so um and and I know that reminded that um if they didn't lose the house it actually frees up their capacity and capability to help those people who have you know so so if you've still got every everything in your and you haven't been directly infected by the disaster that might be a good um time to think about what you might be able to contribute to the recovery because of that um and that's really useful because um we're looking for you know we need for the people who've been um really profoundly affected to be able to be supported by those who still have a bit more capacity because perhaps the impact for them hasn't been as bad the other thing I would say though about this is that you don't have to have had flame on your property or flood water through your house to be affected by a disaster and it's really really important you know when looking at this terrific example that we've been provided by covent it's not right to say unless you have had coven it hasn to a greater or lesser extent by this virus whether or not you've actually contracted it um and so it is with natural disasters as well um the sense of disruption to lives of uncertainty about the future um the distress that we feel on on behalf of other people um and even the impacts of um you know the damage to our environment all are experienced by people irrespective of whether their own individual property was affected so um it's important for people to know that uh you know that that impact can be uh very wide wide reaching and widespread and it's and it belongs to the people who are experiencing it so it's not anyone else's job to say you should feel like um you should be feeling like this because this is your situation um no you know you just need to listen to how people are feeling not tell them how they should feel so yeah yeah yeah and even just by helping it can be as something as simple as um you know just reaching out to your neighbor and just have a bit of a chat you know it doesn't need to be anything strenuous so yeah they can emerge in communities what um has been referred to as a hierarchy of grief um and it's sort of like well um these people are at the very pointy end of the grieving so you know I'm not worthy of feeling sad because my situation is entertaining as bad as theirs you know that's not helpful because um in order to um in order to process grief you have to experience you have to sit with it you have to understand it you have to be able to express it um so it can be useful to maybe to find people who've had a similar experience and talk to each other about what that experience has been like but okay two people who didn't lose their homes but who've been working really hard to support people who have they may be able to have a conversation around grief and how they feel that might work more effectively than someone who's lost that that can be um you know one strategy but at the end of the day we go through this as whole of whole communities and um and we need to respect and understand that everyone's experience will be different and will last the time that's you know uh right for them so exactly we'll just go we've got one more question here and then we might move to your next part so the other question we've got here is where do you see trauma trauma-informed community development fitting into recovery or is it the main focus um I think I think community development after disaster is uh it's a critical factor but trauma informed is the really important part to sort of put in front of that so um it it's really interesting when um a community has a disaster and very often the um all of the well-meaning supports sort of flow in um money for new projects money for new activities and uh and lots of um focus on on making the community better or you know helping it to hassle and more anguish for the people who are trying to sort of get their lives back together you know so um I remember um our community being told we had to have um our recovery plan by the 30th of march um so that it could be incorporated into the statewide recovery plan by the 30th of june we had the fires on the 7th of february and we lost 46 people in our community um so we weren't even remotely ready to start thinking about whether we should have a new hall or where we'd like our walking tracks built you know so so I think it's absolutely critical that um that when we are trying to support communities to recover that we take the um take account of the trauma that there that they've experienced and be very very respectful about the time that it takes to be able to get into the right mindset to be able to think about the future um because um yes we love to get in there and build new stuff and be able to snip ribbons informed practice then there's a very real possibility that we make people's situation worse yeah very much we'll move on to the next part of your presentation and then people can still type questions and we can come back to those yep right and this is sort of picking up a little bit about what we've been talking about and that is the idea of maintaining a holistic view of community so when we're thinking about recovery um we need to be able to focus on recovery across all of the domains um social natural economic and built so if we've put all of our energies into the built environment in recovery so we're all about getting the buildings fixed from the roads and the bridges we will have some lovely rebuilt uh infrastructure but that on its own doesn't automatically uh equate to a recovered community so and I think it's important for us also to know that communities are systems and and recovery is a system as well so when we do something in one part of the system else in the system so we need to understand what that looks like um you know we don't want to chop down all the trees for example um in order to make uh you know make the area less vibrant because the natural environment natural recovery is negatively impacted by that even though um you know you can sometimes feel like the logical thing to do so um if we have a lot of um donated goods coming into the community then there can be an impact on the economic recovery so it's just about making sure that we maintain that that holistic view and that we're keeping track of um making sure there's a focus in all four of the recovery domains so some things we know about recovery we've talked about the pace and speed um there isn't any one one right speed uh or pace for the recovery to happen uh for some people it can't_``_3021.28 happen quickly enough other people need a bit more time to be ready to move into the various stages of recovery so um I a speed uh or how quickly things should happen we need to do the urgent stuff urgently no question about that so you know we obviously need to get things like um uh food and water and shelter and fencing and first aid all those things that happened in the early stages need to happen very very quickly but other things need more time and people need to have the time to think through what it is that they want to do and how uh their lives are going to look going forward so um and it's it's useful to be aware that um yeah uh the what's right for one person what might not necessarily be right for another and it doesn't make any of them wrong wrong it just means that they've got a different pace of recovery that they need and in order to support them people know what they need and what will work for them so you know when in doubt just ask you know really we need for um we need for people who are recovering to be able decisions about what they would find useful um as again before I mentioned you know it's not helpful to be told how you should be feeling um so much better to ask how people are feeling and then respond to that you can't recover if you don't know what's going on you know this is pretty fundamental but continuing to be able to access the information you need making sure that information is available you know when you when you need it um is is so important because it's very disempowering to feel like you don't exactly know what's going on and so sometimes that information has to be repeated lots of times it has to be provided in lots of different ways because of the effects of adrenaline but it's important that people are able to access the information that they need to make good decisions and similarly you know connection is what underpins our community being able to be resilient and this has been a particular challenge in relation to covert because all of the things that we would normally they haven't been able to do in quite the same way because we haven't been able to get together for events or you know visit each other in our homes and uh and families getting together so there's a real um uh there's a really significant impact there and I mentioned at the beginning I think what we're going to find is that recovery overall is potentially progressing more slowly than it would if we weren't trying to deal with uh with a global pandemic on top of an actual disaster there are different criterias for success now this is a sort of a a reference I guess to the fact that sometimes people will tell you recovery is progressing really well and you will be thinking really um are we having the same disaster because I feel like recovery is not progressing at all um and so what we need to understand is that um that people will measure the success of recovery differently depending on on their situation so sometimes we can have a political criteria um what's happening politically around um you know the criteria that might apply to um those people who weren't directly affected um oh isn't it good that everything's getting back to normal and you know um you might think that it could be uh it couldn't be less normal so so just be mindful that um that your own criteria for success might not be um the same as someone else's and sometimes the success that you hear about might relate to a particular um situation or a particular speaking position and that might not necessarily reflect where you are doesn't mean you're doing it wrong it just means that you know there's a different criteria being applied um now needs and priorities evolve over time we're already across this because we're you know coming up to one two years in sapphires and I'm sure you're already really aware of the things that were helpful early on may not be relevant anymore they might not even be helpful anymore and new things are needed so being able to adapt to the way that the way that they sex support is important in order for recovery to continue to progress anniversaries matter my own confession here is that um as the first anniversary of the black saturday fires approached I was um feeling rather impatient and short-tempered about what felt like a lot of distracting conversations around the anniversary and and I remember thinking oh it's just another day like why is everyone so fixed about it you know um and then as the day uh dawned I realized that um that 12 month or two year or three year anniversary and beyond that's a really important time to reflect on what has happened and also how far you've come what there is still to do and how you might you know tackle the next part of the of the journey so be kind to yourself around the anniversaries and to each other because they are a really significant time and it's easy to feel like um you can feel very self-critical uh around that sort of significant date that you might not have progressed with your recovery as far is that you know progress is still occurring and the timing will be what the timing is so um yeah it's important to acknowledge and so after my first sort of um uh misstep around anniversaries I've taken time every year since just to spend with people who matter to me and to to reflect on what happened and and how we managed and um some of the positive things that have come about um and also to remember the people that we that we lost so um yeah I think anniversaries are a really important time for that reflection to happen um and all of this recovery stuff takes so much longer than we think um so much longer than we can imagine at the beginning certainly and then again compounded by subsequent events which then extends the recovery period um it's exhausting and I think it's probably a little bit like this that every year you spend in recovery can feel like seven years of normal life there's so much change and so much to do so many decisions to make so much exhausting so some practicalities um some things to think about again emphasizing the right timing is what's right for you don't get drawn into any other anyone else's time frame or time table for recovery and I can say my parents who lost their home in 2009 um it took them more than two years to decide to rebuild uh on their block in strathun and that was despite the fact that they have four pretty well functioning adult kids and extended family all trying to support them to do whatever it was they needed to do and at first they thought it would be too hard to rebuild they lost their neighbors on either side and one family they think next year for 25 years so mum and dad felt that it would be too sad to be rebuilding on their block and looking out their window at those empty properties but after an amount of time and elapsed uh they worked out it would actually be too sad not to rebuild there so sometimes you just need the time to be able to think through no point in rushing that I would say that um uh the the media reporting between the first anniversary and the second anniversary is likely to be quite different and so the first anniversary there's lots of um uh reporting around you know how hard it's been for people and how how difficult the experience is and and you know focus on um you know the struggles of recovery the second anniversary tends to be more like what do you mean there's still people living in caravans you know so there's a there's a an element of anger and frustration about the fact that it's all taking so long um and that's well intentioned on the part of the media they're trying to advocate for um the best outcomes for people who've been affected but what it can end up doing is making people feel bad about their own progress and make they can make them feel like they haven't gone as far with their recovery as they should have so try and resist the temptation to get drawn into're working on the time frame that's right for you it can be useful when you feel ready to think about reconnecting with the things that you used to do before the disaster happened um things that you've enjoyed doing and you might have already done this or maybe you haven't yet but things that you like to do before are probably going to be things that you like to do in the future and sometimes you have to make a conscious effort to actually pick those things up and reconnect with them and find the joy that they used to give you and some days are better than others you know and that's true of ordinary life it's certainly true of recovery um some days you just have to you know get back under the dinner and and that's okay because um hopefully the day after that will be a bit easier um sometimes things go really well and you have a really productive day and you get lots of things done sometimes everything goes wrong um and it feels like the the a day at a time um and don't get too bogged down when things don't work because there are a lot of little setbacks a lot of those snakes and the snakes and ladders um and they get shorter over time so that's that's something to look forward to um here's one of the sayings and for some people um you might already be at this point or you might already be beyond it um it's very natural to tell ourselves that once the house is rebuilt everything will be fine and so we fix on that as a point in time a real goal and it is a goal a really important goal in your recovery is to get your house rebuilt or to get yourself resettled somewhere else and there's a lot of good that comes as a result of that but it's also a really difficult time and sometimes it's quite a shock for people to move into their new house and then realize they still feel like they're not there yet um that there's still house can even be quite distressing because it's not the old house and you're forced really in that moment to contemplate that you know this is your new life and your old life is not not really available to you anymore so um it's really important to look forward to the future and to look forward to having your home rebuilt I'm not suggesting for a moment you shouldn't do that but just know that it will come with um potentially a sense of sadness about that sort of transition from the life that you had before the disaster to the life that you have now it's also a time when uh often people have to take stock of exactly what they've lost um because you have boxes of things in people's sheds and people you know other boxes of things that you've got with you know family members etc and then suddenly when you get into your new home you've got all of whatever remains there for the first time perhaps and it can be quite um sad and you've managed to um to bring with you but um but this truth will pass um and you make new memories uh and new happiness um in your new home as time progresses so um just sort of know that that will be how that works and um and don't be um don't be too uh hard on yourself if if you feel like that should just be an entirely joyous time and and there is there's still some sadness that's connected with it um similarly the well intentioned question of uh aren't you over it and I often it's not quite that blunt um sometimes it's a little bit more more delicate but the the essence is um it's been a long time it feels like this should be something that you've now moved through um and usually the motivation for that question is uh the distress that other people feel at seeing your pain so I need you to be okay because I'm really it makes me sad to see you sad that kind of thing which is understandable um my mum who is not a writer at all um started to write poetry after uh the fires and it helped her to express how the experience had made her feel and how recovery uh was was um you know affecting her um her very dear friend said to her oh agnes you should stop writing those poems they just make you sad and so she she didn't understand that being sad was part of the process and being able to work through that sadness was what was needing to happen not avoiding it um and so she meant well but her advice was not helpful um because um that that process was actually really useful for mom to to be able to do that so just be mindful that that the more time that elapses the more likely you are to potentially hear that sort of those sort of comments from well-meaning people um they mean well but they don't actually understand what this process is like so and they're worried about their discomfort um you need to look out for your own impacts for kids and young people um are very profound and we could have another two hours talking about this topic but it's important to know that as the adults get their act together and sort of get their recovery um a bit more um on track that's often the time when the kids feel safe to be able to express what's happening for them and so it can seem quite strange because like well things are just getting better and now the kids are coming include and you know having nightmares and and etc um that's because they feel that the situation is secure enough for them to be able to express um those emotions so uh so sometimes it can feel like it suddenly gets worse for kids what's actually happening is that they've been incredibly brave and stoic for a really long time and then when things start to get a bit um safe and secure then they feel that they're able to express their their distress and their concerns so be mindful and on the lookout for that um but it's really important to know that everything that adults go through kids and young people go through as well even really little kids so making sure that we're including them in the recovery process is very important um and finally there's a chance um for a thing that has now got a name which is post-traumatic growth so the important um thing to note about disasters is whilst there's a lot of bad stuff it's not all bad and sometimes we learn things about ourselves that we would never have had the opportunity to learn if we hadn't had uh the storm or the fire or the cyclone or the drought so be a be alert to those things that you can reflect on that make you feel proud about what you've been able to do how far you've come um maybe you observe them in other people you know it was really great how you took charge of that or it was really terrific and you managed to do that thing or you know I really like the poem you give people some confidence and and you know and acknowledge how far they've come and and look after yourselves um it's really glib thing to say but this is the hardest work you'll ever do and so taking time to do what um what gives you joy um what helps you top up your tank um taking time out and tone away taking a holiday if that's what you want to do um being around people who um who lift you up and and give you confidence and whose company you enjoy um is probably one of the most important things more important perhaps than what color the tiles are going to be in the bathroom or you know um what paint you're going to paint on the on the fascia you know taking time to to spend time with people who um who can offer you that support and comfort and confidence is a really good investment in your own recovery okay so I'm going to stop sharing um now like that um and we might have oh we're really pretty tight any time for questions or whether we might answer them after the fact but that's okay yeah thank you so much for that and that was incredible and I know I learned some stuff along there along the way too just to remember we do have residents um online here but we also do have service providers also joining us today and I guess I've got a question for that you talk about the significance of anniversaries and I know from like a council or a service perspective we'd love to get into it and fix it with your experiences of anniversaries and witnessing other people needing to acknowledge them is this something that we should be um helping with reconnecting with pre-disaster activities workshops or activities or is it more of a private thing for each family or resident to go through um I think it can be both I think sometimes a really um uh well structured and appropriate um uh event or acknowledgement can be really useful for people and um and certainly there's lots of examples of those sometimes um you know uh you know have an event an annual event to acknowledge the impacts of the disaster um but it's also important for people to engage with that if they feel like it's right for them and not to be not to be made to feel bad if they don't because sometimes all people can do is spend some time in quiet reflection themselves that's all they're up for so and that's that's entirely um right for them so I think it's about um being um aware and alert to the to people's different needs um and and asking you know what would you like to do what would what would be rightful for you at this time you know that's that's probably the way to approach it that's great thank you do we have any other questions in the chat look there's nothing there at the moment girl so maybe if we've got anything else um if ann needs to to go or she's welcome to stay then um we can take them on notice one that just came through okay while we understand the trauma that individuals go through are there specific disruptions that happen at the community level that should be addressed um yes so um communities will often um reform after disaster in um in a way that's um predictable but not sustainable so everyone becomes very close uh everyone sort of in everyone's business you know like it's quite a a strange um uh space to be in um and that can last for a period of time but it's not it's not normal community structure it's not normal it's not normally the way communities operate so um so those super close relationships over time will start to dissipate um and people will go back to socializing with the people that they you know have have things in common with groups will reform um and the focus will be less about the disaster and more about what um the community values so that's a very normal and natural process but um what we want to do is support that to happen in a're helping people to understand that um that yes you know you um you won't be feeling the same way um two or three years after the disaster as you were feeling the first two or three weeks after about everyone in your community so um I think we want to be able to create opportunities um for shared understanding about where people are at um and and how the community will look going forward and we talked um before about you know trauma-informed community development that's really an important part of this process is actually supporting the community to develop beyond the disaster in a trauma-informed way in a way that actually reflects and respects what they've been through um even in terms of things like preparedness you know um we heard about the importance of preparedness in the presentation earlier we really need um to help communities to be able to get ready for subsequent disasters but we have to do it in a very gentle and respectful way and in a way that acknowledges their own experience and how much they now know about ways that we can work to support the evolution of the community through the recovery experience and we need to take our lead from the community about what's right at any given time thank you so much ann for your time today um just really really acknowledge that you've taken time out of your sunday to be with us today and um your knowledge is incredible in this space and um yeah if there's any further questions that come through I might reach out to you but thank you again so much for your time um we appreciate you coming along today thank you very much for having my very best wishes to everyone um and it's a great initiative today so well done to everyone that's been involved in presenting it thank you thank you thanks so much ian okay we're just going to have a short break now while we welcome our next panelists and get the room set up while we are doing so we're just going to play a video that we have filmed as part of a dilly so this was a project that was made in partnership with the rotary club of voluntary north and it was called youth voices and it was around supporting the children and young people of voluntary in their recovery from the fire hearing a little bit about their recovery journey and how they'd like to be supported moving forward with disasters or resilience and preparedness so it's uh it is quite an emotional video um so if there's any questions that come up after we're happy to take questions about that before we go into our next panel presentation um but yeah I hope you all enjoy this film it's called youth voices and it was filmed in november last year with a group of young people from wellington with support from the southwest sydney primary health network um psychologists from those teams who've been working in recovery as well and the rhetoric club of poland north families impacted by the bushfires were telling us that their kids needed support after the fires caseworkers and mental health services were available but we wanted the chance to share and talk about their experiences and how they're feeling after the fires 2019 and 2020 have been difficult years for all of us in wallindilli we knew these kids and young people were already extremely resilient they've been through fires flood and covert 19 in 2020 as well as many other challenges so we created youth voices an opportunity for young people to further realize their own inner strengths and resilience a chance to be with other young people to support each other through something risky to push yourself out of your comfort zone in a safe and supported way together whether it's doing a giant swing climbing something really high crawling through a dark and confined space or being interviewed for the film these kinds of activities can all help improve the young person's confidence self-esteem and resilience to ensure we provided a fun and safe environment we held the event at cataract scalp park in atlanta with qualified child psychologists and social workers from at full potential and the community links reframe organizations to provide a safe space to they found can be used to get them through future challenges of everyday life and growing up we are so proud of all the children and young people who participated in youth voices it was a fire like right next to our house in the backyard like right next to our house so we had to evacuate because there was a whole bunch of black leaves everywhere it was very smoky so we evacuated to my auntie's house my other auntie um for about three nights we rang all the christmas presents just to make sure and um we were really scared my dad took like the shortcut thing everything was on fire and I used to like I used to always there was this creek that we had to go past and it was on fire that me and my brother had really cool times in hopefully we'd go down there and catch like yabbies and stuff we'd I'd have a little boat that I'd just go around and always go faster you guys go go fast and now let's go on things and um I lost like my house wait my mom lost her grandfather's wedding ring my nan and mum went to this meeting about it and they said they have like two to three days to pack up and the next day the house is gone they didn't know that the house was burnt down yet but when the fire came around it went like a ring around our whole property when I called the triple o again my brother was on the other line because he was actually out because john was fighting the fires and mitchell was out because when he rang the home phone to check on us john was like we're on fire and that's when he started to freak out and just just told the lady to get help get send someone out there my family were in trouble it sounds like it was a really really difficult experience to kind of go through yeah yeah and something that still carries a really really big weight on you now yeah and at least I saved two of my dogs and was like nope we're getting out of here we had to evacuate because the smoke was getting really thick and the fires were getting really close and we had to pack up all our stuff they just said get grab your bags just grab some like jump or something real quick and run I could see the fire from where I lived which was clicked in two friends they lost their houses in buxton I couldn't see any clouds it was just like an orangey red color and I could see like a big mushroom the southerly wind change just came in I didn't even see it coming it just came out of my way it was sad and very complicated yeah um we evacuated because we knew where the fire was and we had to evacuate we went to picton club and then it was like night and then we saw it on the news and it's just like that's our house we were pretty prepared because we knew that eventually it's gonna hop and it's gonna come here but it was my mom checked the thing fires came you're very lucky because the fires actually jumped the road onto our property we put our storage in the containers but the container burnt two of them actually it started coming up on the news and all the koalas and all the animals I got worried for the animals because I absolutely love animals dad stayed with the dogs to fight the fires with our next door neighbor and it would get really really close but then it would rain and then it would get really close again then the wind changed I could just see it as soon as I got home just too big of a fire just it was pretty sad they lost everything so and like to look at what like I'm lucky and what I have compared to what other people have like they have lost their homes that's just like I don't don't I wouldn't take anything for granted because like yeah it's a real good thing that people share their experiences with the fire because it's like a getting released but then when that darkness gets released you feel free and not so sad anymore after the fires went we made different gates just scattered around everywhere just in case it happens again if we have gates scattered around so then they can go like don't say oh yeah no it's okay when everything could be gone like say okay we need to get this stuff something could happen like don't tell them you're going to die like tell them like slowly think that you're going to build a new house and it's going to be twice as good it's going to be so much better you're going to have so many more memories in that and it's going to be even better even though you've lost your house you still got your family you still got loving people to support you and bless you and when you have them then there's nothing to really worry about thanks so much for sharing that nut every time I watch it no matter how many times I watch know those uh those children who have you know stood in front of that camera and told their story um are so amazing um and I think you know we can all learn a lot from them so thank you so much problem no it's a it's a great video I think it really shows the resilience of our young people um but it also shows that they really take in so much and I think that we really need to be mindful that they they do see a lot and hear a lot during disaster we need to give them that space to share those stories and and to move forward from that um but no thank you so much to all the families who participated in that filming and I know we've got some of those families online this morning so a big thank you for allowing us to share those children's journeys we've also got some other videos to show later on um so we've got one from new south wales state emergency services the acting assistant commissioner for regional operations on um and when we complete the full expo we will be sharing a um stories towards regeneration video that was put together uh it's a song that was put together called don't let it burn by some local people in the area called the james brothers and the sephto brothers so we'll we'll be sharing that later on at the closing of our expo so now I would like to welcome tanya and michelle these beautiful ladies that you can see on screen today both tanya michelle are from community links wellbeing and they are our lead local recovery support service that were appointed by resilience new south wales tanya michelle will be talking to us today around the experiences of the recovery support service in the world and dilly and windy caribbe what they have been tasked to do what they actually did what who they have worked with and what the ongoing needs are for the areas tanya has more than 25 years experience in the community and welfare sectors in leadership strategic project development and management stakeholder relationships and community engagement through and child protection fields including public housing youth suicide prevention youth homelessness domestic and family violence and cultural and linguistical diverse communities including newly arrived refugees michelle has been working across the community sector for the past 30 years in areas including disaster recovery and management homelessness domestic violence and education throughout her career michelle has worked in direct service delivery leadership and management in may 2020 tanya along with colleague colleagues michelle and also rayleigh and daley who cannot be with us today emmett uh implemented the resilience new south wales funded recovery support service on behalf of community links wellbeing in the wallindili and windjacaribi to support residents impacted by the 2019-20 greenwater creek and moreton national bushfires work includes providing information and referral advocacy and support and complex case management the recovery support service walks beside those residents mostly impacted by the bushfires on their journey of recovery ensuring their needs and their voices are not lost within the system and they make sure that they adapt to provide them with the continued support they also provide support not only in that space but in other disasters and thank you so much thanks kim thanks so much for having us here today before I start I just wanted to acknowledge the um traditional lands which we're meeting on today and particularly those that were ravished by the bushfires so the lands of the gundangara and darawal people and pay my respects to elders past present and emerging so just briefly community links wellbeing has been around in the community for over 30 years um in various capacities we've turned into an organization that really does have something for everyone from family support community engagement youth services mental health allied health ndis support and of course disaster recovery we were thrilled in may 2020 to receive the um contract from resilience new south wales to provide support to people across burlingary and wing caribbean that was initially a 12-month contract and we're really lucky that has been extended until december of this year basically what we were tasked to do was provide support information uh decision making resources and an advocacy for people impacted by the bushfires and that could be any form of impact the bushfires what that turned into as kim said in the introduction was complex case management because as we've heard throughout the last three days recovery is incredibly complex and bushfire in particular is complex because it has such an impact on the land and the environment as well as the people who live on it so we have since may 2020 worked with about 240 households which is about 500 individuals and that is probably just the tip of the iceberg we're really blessed in the recovery space to have an extended team of people and services across both holland illinois therapy but particularly natalie korean and kim are our central kind of support team along with michelle bailey and myself and thankfully korean natalie and kim will be around a little bit longer the recovery support service but we thought rather than do a straight up presentation we would collate some of the questions that we get asked quite a bit and talk about that as well as any questions that you guys have please pop them in the chat or um in the q a but we thought we'd start by talking about what it is we actually do for people and I'm going to turn to michelle and say michelle what do we do what do we do for people and actually I was looking at the question on your cat thinking what do we do for people um no look I think for us the and it's it's interesting your comment around what we thought we would be when we first started in this journey is something perhaps quite different and I think first and foremost what we do is we provide the opportunity for people to share and tell and have a gain some clarity as to where they're at in their their recovery process and what's happening and then because of the the beauty of this program has been that there's not a limit it's not time limited other than contractually but in terms of the number of contacts we have with people how we interact so people come and go and we can actually form that relationship and walk alongside them as what are they tomorrow morning and future we don't purport to be able to fix all of that stuff it's not what we do but what we can do is listen identify what the resources are the best and then check in and check that those things are happening and see what needs to happen next the the reality of recovery and that that whole process is that we make great plans and this is going to happen and that's going to happen often that just doesn't happen because someone's not ready the resources aren't there things get in the way life crops up another disaster occurs so for us it's also about ensuring that we continue to have that conversation and continue to check in and make sure that we recalibrate as needs be and also because resources shift and change as well so what was there when we started two years ago there's now a whole range of different resources um so it's about ensuring that people are aware of that and keeping them abreast of what's going need anything else no but one of the questions we do get asked a lot is who are the people that we work with and I think it's really important to note that those people they're just like you and I these um this is not a group of people who traditionally access support services so this is their first time around they've never had much like you hear people talking about I've never had to make an insurance claim it's the same thing I've never had to speak to vincent de paul or the red cross or any of those things so these are people who are really new to this system of operating and any of us have ever tried to navigate centrelink or anything else we know how difficult that is doing that on top of a disaster is really very challenging and if I can just say tend to I think one of the ad complexities is a lot of those systems are set up for different demographics so people are suddenly there's an assumption that we're all that's not the case so our role has often been very much a supporting people negotiating that piece as well what does that look like how do we actually ensure that people are able to access the services they need when those services perhaps aren't necessarily user friendly should I say that or user accessible and how do we ensure that occurs absolutely now I wanted to say natalie and karin you're welcome to jump in at any moment with any cupboards now angie touched on this in her presentation but we wanted to bring it up as well because we get asked not so much about caravans but tents are there still people living in tents um as to people living in temporary accommodation yes there are and as um anne spoke about there's a whole lot of reasons for that it's not that they've forgotten or nobody's helping them they're often there by a choice maybe not the choice they wanted to make but it's a choice they've got it could be that they really want to stay want to move off the land so they're happy to stay in a temporary accommodation at the moment um or it just may be that there aren't a lot of other options um what else would you say look I think that and that one particularly in the current climate as we all know in the across both lgas accommodation has availability and cost is huge so often it becomes a financial imperative to be there but it's also about being available I think for a lot of people on land on property whilst the rebuild is occurring and whilst the re-establishment of their land is occurring because I was and I reflected was a reflection of this last week and I talked to someone and they were saying you know one of the great joys then has been living on their property as they've started to re-establish their land and their and their gardens and all of those things if they had been living away from land they wouldn't have been able to experience that and see that and that's been a really whole range of reasons um why people are still in temporary accommodation and and not least which of course as we all acknowledge that the process of rebuild is a long drawn out process and takes time and takes energy um and but we also need to be want to be involved in that process so it's it's there's a range of reasons why it occurs and as to do we know that there are people living in those conditions absolutely are we going to talk to you about it no because we do have we there's confidentiality there's privacy there are things that we're privy to uh that we're not actually going to share with other people but if you are concerned definitely come and have a conversation with us um but rest assured these people are they're okay we know what's going on okay another question people often ask us is is there still grants available short answer is longer answer though is there are still opportunities to look at what other supports are out there as recovery grow so on new grants will come into when they may not be directly related to the bushfires but they may be related to other parts of recovery so it's always worth having a conversation and when rss um winds up in december certainly you know contacting with mountain queen around what others keep asking those questions because there are things that come up all the time there is there is information up there and I can't I can't stress the number of times we've scratched our heads and thought how is that going to be resolved how are we going to find x and through a chain of events um we find it um I think the only thing I want to add here too and tanya was talking about the fact that the people we work with this is a whole new area this is new for them it's not something I've had to do before engage with services for much of the service system it's a little bit like that as well um and also for a lot of the businesses just you know put a shout out there to a number of businesses who have been incredibly approachable and incredibly supportive particularly through organizations such as the online platform give it um in partnership with them so my my point is don't stop raising the question and asking the questions have all those grants from red cross and there's the traditional um areas finished yes they have but it doesn't mean there isn't still opportunity to work together within community to find out what we can do to support that and that's one of the real benefits we have with the local recovery research committee so first of all julian would you care if you have those networks in place so there's the ability for for your service and also for karen and I to advocate on what those needs are in a forum where we have that mix of service providers some business people as well but we can talk about those data and look for outside of the box solutions to some of those those things and some of the community-based organizations long period of time have also adapted to the needs of community by providing grants as you said that people weren't necessarily expect related but they've applied those to these circumstances which has been great yeah I think there's an absolute awareness is that this is a situation we haven't dealt with before so there is a real willingness to youth mark to start well okay how do we do this differently how do we think differently how do we apply the the criteria in a way that supports the individual or that family definitely we're still getting inquiries we did have somebody come forward this week who mentioned that she hadn't come forward previously because she was concerned that the grants might have finished up and and that was the conversation I had there yes well some of the grants have finished up there's always other options that we can look at so definitely still call definitely still contact us and we're more than happy to see what we can come up with and there are other organizations working in this humanity are a really good example where they have programs they're going out into the community and helping with things like preparedness and clean up which often do it cost money to do this stuff but they have some funding in place where they're able to support that process as well and if you're interested in hearing more about that contact either natalie or korean depending on your lga um but while we were talking about grants I thought it might be a good time to also talk about donations and possibly the flip side of donating because we're a fabulous country we are really supportive when it comes to these natural disasters but I think it's um we really need to talk about what responsible donating looks like so anyone who's lost a home or the ability to live in their home because of a disaster as much as they're grateful the last thing they really need is someone sharing a truck with their grandmother's lounge and some tin goods going on a date basically um it's not helpful because can open and burned as well that's just the reality what people need is money money to go into services like givit.com.edu they're and they'll also take um secondhand goods as well and they're pros at finding things for people uh red cross organizations like that that do give that's where I'm suggesting the money goes and if you do have your grandmother's lounge maybe sell it on gumtree for 50 bucks and donate that money because it's really important for people who have lost everything to have some autonomy in replacing what they've lost they shouldn't just have to take the second hand television or you know somebody's dinner set because they don't have anything that that's not actually nice we should actually be able to give them the choice to replace something with what they'd like to have so I would encourage people next time you're in a position to donate to think about some of those organizations who take monetary donations or give it dot com today you is also a great resource resources that we have like facebook marketplace even just putting it up there to say hey I've got this if anyone would like it just gives people that choice and then is that the lounge they want do they need a lounge are they ready to take a lounge as well um and one of the things that's that really sticks with me from my very first week in the role was going out to meet a family who were living in a rental property um three generations who have been living in the house that was unfortunately destroyed by fire um and they had these three huge bags massive bags of clothing that were just in the middle of their room and because they're in the midst of the covered pandemic no one was taking secondhand clothes so they had these huge bags of clothing that had been given to a five or six family members that they just didn't have any use while it was just taking a lot of space but it left them feeling quite guilty because they really appreciated the that and that they weren't utilizing them as well so it just kind of um maybe just added that little bit of guilt that probably wasn't helpful for them and they're already going through such a difficult time um I will mention as well that council does have a mayor's relief fund well into the council that we do uh we did get very generous support from community and 100 of that funding was also given out to community members as well but givet is an amazing resource and they've done amazing work across both sides since the fires with really practical supports that have made such a big difference for people's lives during their recovery so really appreciate giving and um I think they attend both councils recovery and resilience committees as well and they're definitely along a big part about forward planning for future disaster events should mention and give it's not the only one but we've just worked so closely with them I will give a shout out to good 360 as well because they've been really say that we often hear the phrase dignity of choice and that's really what we're talking about and I from for me personally it's about putting myself in that situation in this situation what would I want and I would want the opportunity to be able to choose what it is that I have access to um rather than as as not quite beautifully caught you know rather just being given to me and and having them deal with that sense of what do I do with this now I don't know what to do with this or I feel guilty because I'm not more appreciative and all of those things that are just human emotions but it is ultimately about having that choice can I just add to that to girls if possible um and it's still in early stages yet but I believe that there is uh some framework being done at the state level around uh those those donations and things like that and how it's actually going to be managed moving forward to make it you know easier for that kerry and I had run we actually ended up having as much as it was fantastic and people were amazing we went through nearly six loads of rubbish that had to be removed because of stuff that we just could not donate onto onto people so um so that's you know another another aspect of it as well um and thankfully um thank you to winter caribbe council because they took up the um cost on that to actually have that dumped so um yeah so there's all those extra extra things as well so okay um another question we get asked a lot is which we've kind of touched on um when someone says I have a friend who lost their shared their fence their garden maybe even their house and they haven't got any um support yet can you help what can they do um well I would be saying definitely contact the recovery support service or your community resource offices at council because there is as we've talked about quite a bit that we can do and that would start with it is that they need a lot of people early on particularly when they got their grants or insurance payoffs or yep no problem we can we can get on with this this is great but nearly two years into the process uh there's actually a lot of gaps and a lot of um support that's still required that they just didn't realize they would need and a lot of that's not tangible support it's not about things or services it's actually about that piece around how do I get through that mental health so psychosocial support all those big words but really are about people feeling isolated um cut off from their communities cut off from their families we've had the over the additional overlay of covert so there's a whole range of things and what we're finding is that quite often those the more practical pieces have fallen into place to a degree but it's then that other piece of how do I continue to deal with this and how do I forge a new forge forward and new reality in this new environment that I'm in but the short answer is it is not too late please do make contact because there's still um certainly a lot we can do to support you now on friday this question came up and was dealt with really really well but I want to touch on it again because I know I was asked even this week in terms of their what people perceive to be the slow rebuild process and that misconception that perhaps everyone's da's are being held off held up by council so whereas we know that is not the case and I the town planners who were here on friday did a really good job of explaining that as well as all the other panelists but it's not council holding up this process it's it's a long process if you've ever built a house it's not a short process there's a lot of requirements if you've ever not wanted to build a house but found yourself in that predicament just multiply that by a million and there's a lot of things going on for people who may just not even be ready to consider that yet so please rest assured it is not council holding up the process it is just a long process yeah definitely so I think there's so many complexities and I think we did have I think probably the longest year that I've been aware of did take between two and three months to go through but that was a really complex application that was belkappian was the very first resident evil delete to apply for bell capping and what we did was take the time to work through that process really thoroughly so we went to caribbean shire council and the new south wales rfs to really go through that process to make sure that everybody was protecting the residents and council as well um with that process because the last thing we want is when somebody has been traumatized already is to rush to fda and then for that process not to have been thoroughly thought through um so that that da was um definitely the we don't have any da's pending at the moment a majority of das are going through quite quickly once they're launched but it's just a case of people being ready to lodge those da's and there's other complexities um within wall and delhi as well like minds of science it'll also be an issue down in which caribbean that does affect that assessment time um but no there's the planners at both councils have got a process in place to ensure that those da's are fast-tracked that they are um immediately looked at and we've got dedicated planners in both councils who will manage that process they've got the experience of approving um bushfire uh rebuilds so uh rebuilds that related properties to the bowel rating particularly a higher bowel rating like a bell 40 about 29 or a flame zone build um so yeah it is a it is a complex process that maybe does take a little bit longer than a straightforward da but they're certainly not being held up by council we certainly are prioritizing a long process for um people trying to rebuild especially if their homes are quite were quite old so the building code of australia was very different back then and some of the um building specifications that are required today so just trying to understand that whole process as well and then just the cost of rebuilding these days timber steel everything has gone up um it's a really tough situation covets coming on top of that as well so just to keep in mind that it's not that they haven't rebuilt that how come you haven't rebuilt in 12 months or 24 months there is so much mentally and then the physical stuff that happens in the background as well but we're all here to support you in that um whatever time you're ready we'll be here maybe just to mention as well that less than 50 percent of our residents in wall and dilly have actually put in da's at the moment yeah there's so so many reasons for that yeah the individual circumstances behind things and then um have some people who are just now with the impacts of kobe building prices going up and supply shortages of things as well holding off with their build so it's a really complex thing that is so different for each individual and I think the other piece that we must always keep in mind too is the overlay of trauma on all of that so whilst we can have a process that on paper looks really clear end to end there's a whole range of decision making that sits within that and for someone as anne beautifully said in her piece you know someone who's been through traumatic events and has is traumatized that decision making process is highly highly impacted and a lot of the work that we do is supporting people to actually think through some of those things not to make the decision for them but to actually support them to sort through what those issues are and that takes the time that it takes because one of the things that we I think we all realize as a team very early on in't that great you're going to get a new home well the reality is no one chose to get a new home in this process this is a process that's been placed upon them um and whether it be a new home a new garden and you outbuildings whatever it might be it wasn't a choice that they've made it's a choice being put upon so that really impacts as well that trauma and decision-making process I think it's really important to always have that in the back of our minds as we go forward I think we've kind of answered my next question which is all right why does everything take so long and that you know and it does why does everything take so long and you can be on the inside looking out asking that question on the outside looking in and it just it takes a long time and I'm someone who just wants it done um whatever it is in my life I just think I've made the decision let's get on with it but in coven yeah covert has really delayed so many things whether it's building materials and labor through to just being able to talk to other people face to face that's had a huge impact on the recovery um which is then the next question I was supposed to ask about rick never mind did you guys want to talk about anything to do with the recovery with the covert or the length of time it takes that we haven't_''_6754.639 said already I think just one of the things that you touched on before around that adrenaline and that that level of adrenaline that you have and how exhausting it can be to live in that moment for a long time so when we were really tired it it just didn't impact on how we're our ability to make decisions and how fast we might make decisions as well I think like you said junior as well being being isolated for so many of us who like to bounce these things off our decision making of other people and we can't necessarily do that incredibly trauma impact that michelle mentioned is it's such a huge thing for people going through this and every person's journey is going to be so different and that's where um I do worry about the pressure that people put on from the outside sometimes just saying to people things like oh what do you mean you haven't rebuilt yet or what do you mean you haven't started building yet and I think that's something that you know it just adds maybe a little bit of pressure to people it can be difficult to manage yeah I feel like the the impact of covert it's like when you are going through a disaster you just yeah like I said you're just not an adrenaline you just need to get through it you adjust it and then all of a sudden you're faced with this completely new disaster and so you're like just park that and let's move through this one and let's go through the motions of this and then follow the media and and work our way through at what point do we stop and go okay let's take it back two years time and now so what do I need to do now like where where am I really like to have to read but it's just it's that cumulative trauma on top of each other so we're still going through it we're still recovering and I think it's interesting um my colleague ray and I was always today and in that first round of lockdown there was almost a sense of an overlay of great we can actually stop for a minute and we can start to think this through so there was some I'd hesitate to use the word value but there was some opportunity in that for things to take a bit of a slow down for people but second time round I think people were starting that that process and some of that decision making was starting to occur and then everything just went went pear-shaped again and I think this had a much more detrimental effect in terms of people's progress and moving forward able to get out there and share with your neighbor what's going on or share with your broader community and have those conversations all of that peace which is really our our normal state as human beings as we in the in the main would like to get out there and have a chat about what's going on and how it's working and do that face to face over the fence or down at the shops all of that came to a standstill and I don't think we can negate the impact of that on individuals and community um within this disaster but also more broadly the community I mean even as a service going out and having those conversations with community I mean there were so many and I'm sure saying now that so many clients are just sitting ourselves in the breadth of that community at the local cafe and just being that continual presence yeah it was taken away that opportunity for residents were taken away that opportunity connection as well between themselves yeah I think it's really just important for that with the fact that people were displaced sometimes in their communities as yes so for a lot of our people they weren't living in the suburbs that they were living in where they lost their home because it doesn't mean there's necessarily rental properties available there so we had people living in other parts of the shire but also in other parts of sydney yeah yeah they were then in complete lockdown because they weren't even within that environment yeah and maybe not even being able to revisit their block or anything during that time as well yeah and also just another thing that I always keep in mind to is the thing that we've seen with the black saturday fires and then beyond bushfire study 10 years on is that there are still people who haven't regaled and put in dnas so when you think about two years down the track and people being you know people being surprised people haven't rebuilt their when you look at that those ten year studies it really puts into context that there are so be a very long-term process and that we need to give people the space to move at their own pace through that journey and I recall as you say that attending a meeting very early on in in our program and um someone and a comment being made isn't it great the rss has been set up um you know it didn't happen last time for two years and I'm thinking all right so I think there has been and we were like you're kidding what do you mean that's two years but that's that's where the learnings are starting to come and gel as well um not necessarily still not quick enough necessarily still not respond but there are improvements being made I would suspect and we can see that even now recently with the disaster events we've had just recently where thankfully council the recovery support service community links um southwest sydney local health district the red cross we were able to mobilize really quickly because of those landings we've taken from those previous events and we're able and some of the flight events we've had as well so we're just learning all the time and it's not perfect but we're getting I think those improvements absolutely yeah I think it's really important to acknowledge as well that one of the reasons we're leading so quickly is unfortunately we've had three declared disasters in less than two years so that does take an enormous toll on the community and it may not impact on every part of the community at once but there is that residual effect knowing that you can't get into pictures because it's flooded knowing that in vilmir there are people who can't get out of their house because there's a great big tree across their driveway or through their house so there's all of that's been happening as well on top of covert so there's been a lot going on since the fires in 2019 2020 and I think the fact that we're also still standing is um a really good sign of how resilient we actually are underneath they're taking a higher volume of calls than ever at the moment as well so all of these cumulative disaster events really events really have taken a toll on community and we are seeing that too with this event here where we are um seeing an immediate reaching out of support for mental health services and wellbeing services um which is it's great that people can acknowledge that that support um will be helpful for them and beneficial for them and also that it's available very quickly as well so we are very grateful for the southwest sydney primary health network for their um their you in mind program and the staff for kids program um that and the refund project for youth that those supports are available to the community and um the recovery support steps can really quickly link people in with those um karen and I can as well but we're probably more likely to get them in touch with the recovery support service because of the broader range of supports that you're able to offer absolutely so as well as those of other mental health supports available so it's going to be whatever suits you as an individual we can help you step through that process and to bear in mind that the government has made a lot of these free or subsidized and that's because it's such an important resource and it's important to know that you know especially leading into christmas when money tends to be tighter than ever that you actually can get the support and it's not going to cost you even more financially which I think is also a reason some people stop themselves from maybe reaching out because I just don't feel they have the financial capacity to get that support and it's good to know you don't it's okay the government has actually made this really accessible for everyone yeah maybe just as well that for some people they might like that support of a counselor or a psychologist and that support is there um but for some people just having a chat with with the recovery support service has been all that they've it's quite often hearing the story and absolutely regardless of how I meet people that are fire impacted whether they're coming in to do paperwork or um to access some support around rates or to apply for a grant I always usually have that conversation in the first I always set aside at least an hour or so to meet those people um and let them tell their story if that's what they want to do and um for so many people just having that ear and that's where the recovery sports service has been really great um just for them to kind of unload a little bit um to talk about what's happening to them and sometimes just saying out loud can be enough to help people to move forward um and if it's not then that's when the recovery support sets can get people in touch with those counsellors or psychologists that can provide that more ongoing or more clinical support if that's what's needed and quite often that's not an immediate thing quite often there's there perhaps there's another service it could support as well and I think I think it's fair to say channel for us one of the great luxuries and great joys of the working in this particular service has been that we've been able to afford that time that we've that we haven't been time limited often services are and it's about how many times you can see so we've had the opportunity to actually interact in community with communities and and with individuals and to have the time to share that and to do that and for us that's been um really valuable and even though the recovery support service will close on the 31st of december the support will not so obviously you have natalie karine and kim are still in place and also community links has been successful in gaining some more funding which we'll be talking about in a lot more detail in the coming days ahead but that support will be ongoing so which we're really excited about um maybe it's a good time to talk community so we talked and talked a little bit about coming into anniversaries and uh getting together and doing those things as a community so it might be a good time to talk about what is happening or what could happen there's lots of potential so from our point of view as the recovery support service because we are closing up we're finishing up we would like to spend some time out in the community just catching up with people and we're going to do that through a series of uh get togethers uh in early to mid december so if you've ever had any engagement with the recovery support service you'll be getting an invitation you can't it will be there um but in terms of and this is something we um literally mentioned before in terms of each council have their local recovery uh committees that also look at what's happening in the community and collate those different events and activities together so people do know what's going on um we're still in that tricky time where there's been difficult to plan some things however I don't know if anyone's aware of anything else going on in the community or if you are in the chat maybe let us know that there are things going on so we can help promote sales yeah so there's a lot of things happening from council point of view so a lot of those um will start in december through to january february so one of the things that we're looking at is an asset mapping and community profiles project so really getting out and engaging with all of our villagers across fallen delhi to talk about the existing assets in their community how we can support them in terms of capacity building opportunities we have a grant for some communities of interest so we're looking at supporting community groups to build their resilience for disasters or continue their recovery journeys depending on what communities need um and providing some resourcing and training opportunities that can help people get those groups up and going um or to support existing community groups to expand on what they're really really excited about a project that's happening with habitat for humanity uh the community resilience around community resilience groups um so that's really exciting so I know yesterday habitat for humanity were out meeting the first long jelly community that they're looking at that's a partnership with the rfs as well as this is a very bushfire program community and that partnership is so important and so for us that will be a huge emphasis going forward he's really partnering with those existing services and community groups to do that work we're partnering with very cross on a similar project with community resilience teams to look at flood preparedness in victim um so that would be a really exciting project as well we have our mobile recovery and resilience time so unfortunately that's been delayed by travid just because we couldn't get the actual so we're looking forward to setting that up as a resource for community and then we're going to be going out and doing more community engagement more time on the ground out in community to look at things like um around technology so supporting people to make sure they've got connectivity and that they understand their different uses I guess how they can use technology to be better prepared and more connected within their communities as well uh as well as some other projects that we're hoping to deliver some well-being projects um mental health first aid and partnering with some of the existing groups like rfs and ses to do some preparedness workshops and community too so there's some of the projects that are happening at the moment um and hopefully also follow up for our children and youth voices as well so getting our young people back together as a check-in while we give out the children's voices storybooks that were produced in onedot projects it actually reminds me there was a fabulous resource developed by the southern highlands foundation in partnership with winter caribbe shy council called photovoice development coordinator kath brennan had a vision that um for our arts travel that we would collate had photo competition sorry um and get uh residents winter caribbean caribbe during and after in their recovery and um the submissions were so overwhelming that we ended up putting them on exhibition through our arts trail in both northern and southern villages and um luckily for us southern southern highlands foundation came on board and and um they've been working well really well together to produce books so the book is now published um it is available for sale across um various locations in which you heard me and all of those proceeds go back into the southern highlands foundation and then they are given out to our bushfire impacted residents directly so um yeah it's a non-profit organization um that's really really well known in the southern highlands and watch this space with them um foundation a really really good bunch of people that are trying to get um this is those um impacted uh families get back up on their feet and moving forward a little bit so that's yeah that's really exciting it's a beautiful book um yeah we're really excited about that one I might jump on top of what for those of you that are watching that may not be bushfire impacted but want to get a part of that you can volunteer for their bushfire and recovery resilience project so what it is it is a statewide project that's luckily enough uh we're lucky enough to have it across windy caribbean and malindi so what they're doing is they're going into the streets of bushfire impact communities where they're um and looking at preparedness and looking at a street view as to how they can clean up the street um help families and residents get well prepared in their homes and around even surrounding bushland or whatever that looks like on their street it's more of a street collaborative it'd be really good to have community connection um back in the streets and all working together so um that's really exciting that's happening across we started out in um dilly we were out on site last week um down at winslow um so watch the space but jump onto habitat humanity.org and on their volunteer page and you can um on top of that as well I think there's a huge a bit of a blockage especially in the windy caribbean for recovery the amount of green waste that is left on those properties from that so council was lucky enough to um get a four and a half million dollar grant for private property and clean up on um council and land as well so that's really exciting we should have people out um getting their land cleared um before christmas so it's really a really great thing we're very very excited for the community um so that's but all residents are aware of that and that yeah we rolled out the next before each weeks which is exciting and so I guess council is um on that front as well we're trying to look forward to seeing beyond that so once properties are cleared what does that look like you're going to have it may be that you have a fair bit of land there that needs to be regenerated looking at gardens how do you look at that so able to get out and ask the community what they need and plus that's almost happened yet so we're just gonna wait for that process to come through I think um throughout that process like it's really good to note that it is another emotionally and mentally draining thing to go through and there'll be a lot of issues that come up there as well so we're really really lucky to work with your property support service so they can be out on the ground while the works are happening and while contracts are being written up because you know that's very overwhelming and then another decision is being forcefully so um yeah we're really we'll just we just keep working together in this space I guess that's why we're here today just to show yeah that we're all working together and we're here for those residents um in terms of what we're doing out in the ninja therapy um sort of again don't want to say kobe has been a blessing but not being out and they're helping on the ground um however in council we have done a bushfire review on our um recovery process bushfires so we have 44 recommendations that we've taken on board as well as a statewide fund and um internally at council we've been working through that so we're really excited to show you some um some initiatives and planning and stuff around that for community and make sure it's more community led and owned really exciting watch that space so I feel like we've been doing so much but it doesn't look you know it's we haven't been out on the ground so like I said out there last week have attacked you maybe next year's really exciting there is so many sustained voluntary there are a number of projects from statewide grants that um have been announced for windy caribbean and voluntary they're still in those project planning stages and that's what they've been doing I guess in this lockdown period is that what communities um will you know best um get out of of them are around preparedness and prevention um educating public disaster mentors there is a range of things from the natural natural environment economic how to prepare your business I could sit here and talk about the projects the next half now but I won't it's not about that um however I think it's really good to know that there are things happening that's really really exciting what's happening in the early 2022 especially in the windy caribbean so reach out if you want to be a part of that there are so many things that you can do in your community to get back out in community reconnect with people that you may not know we do have an influx of new residents as well so get out and learn and I guess just to have a look at um we don't really want to go back down what we've gone through before so how can we be well prepared for that future and not talking about the bushfire impacted communities but the communities that weren't impacted physically by fire and do a bit better there and collectively as a community in that space so yeah there's a lot of stuff happening so queen how will people find out about those things so we are we yeah watch this space we will be having some sort of a road show for a couple of months um next year so from about april march actually some of the projects starting to roll out so um yeah we're working with all of these project partners we haven't announced them yet like I said they're still doing a bit of um there they're talking with us in community who would be most beneficial for this and as I'm adding community as well I'm asking that question of community which is just something that you're interested in um there will be a whole communications thing about that so we will find out about it there will be a burst that's around it I'll be reaching out to all of those impacts and communities and across the shire um jumping on our website would be the but I can pop that in the chat gets really exciting get on board you could be all about environment and stuff and I know what the environment stuff or if your economic focus what's wrong with whatever you typically dancing so terrific yes it's exciting and there will be a whole raft of new announcements where we're expecting announcements around christmas time for more funding that has been awarded and then again um probably around the end of january so there is still lots of exciting stuff happening in the recovery and resilience space um and council websites are your best bet to go to but I'd also give a shout out to community meets well-being website facebook and instagram I will keep you up to date with what's happening not just in the disaster recovery space but across our community as a whole that's the best place to go and find out what's happening or sign up to our newsletter which you can do through the website just to finish that off as well so in addition to the council grants leads well-being we did just receive a whole a whole bunch of new organizations that have now started operating more and dilly through the bc double our extreme funding as well so we recently had a meeting to welcome some of those new providers who are also working in the resilience and recovery space so royal botanic gardens catholic care um to name a few so we're very excited to have those organizations on board and then also some very existing organizations like the boston community association the bucks and rfs and the and some habitat for humanity who would give them funding to expand what they're already doing in that space so yeah it's um definitely follow the council and the community leaks websites because we are constantly connecting with these services and um and really trying to promote what they're doing as well which kind of comes back nicely full circle to that comment earlier about all the brands finished because they have and they haven't yeah I guess the focus yes the personalized ones have in the main finish but it's in community and how we support community to sustain and grow both councils will be happy to talk to community groups about supporting them to put some great applications together so if anyone is interested out there who's a part of the community association who has an idea their local community that they'd like to apply for a grant for feel free to reach out at any time and we'll happily link you into the grand opportunities that we know about and we can maybe talk to you about some support a great application together or providing a support letter for your projects as well so there's constantly different opportunities coming coming up um still and I think that resilience and preparedness element is going to continue on even not necessarily in relation to bushfire but coming out 19 as well so yeah it's a exciting time at the moment in terms of community projects and opportunities for community projects so I'm not sure if there's any questions in the chat mainly because my glasses are for reading not distance so I can not I thought we could use the last few minutes to talk about perhaps what we've learned as having worked in the discovery discovery disaster recovery and space for the last almost two years um certainly probably one of the biggest learnings I think is the issue around consent so when the bush fires came through it was chaos as you know and there's no the privacy laws are really quite clear and government is still kind of wrangling with how they can do that better certainly though on the ground we've learned very quickly uh to get consent on a wider level so in thermi the storm experience was a really good example of this where council very quickly uh came up with a an information gathering form so we could work out what people needed but on that was an opportunity to talk to them about consent not just for council to reach out to them but for other services such as community links or red cross or anyone else working in the discovery um space so that residents would have that information without having phone call from someone from the recovery support service or from council and you can't remember meeting us because it was all a bit crazy and hazy at the time but we remember meeting you and we certainly do follow up um in the weeks and even months ahead we're happy to make those calls and see where you're up to um as your recovery journey kind of progresses so that's probably one of the big learnings for us on the ground that we try and get that consent and you don't have to give it and you can withdraw it really important to know that I think the other big thing for me would just be being visible and available and there to listen and it doesn't matter if you're angry or you're sad or you don't have anything at all to contribute in the way of feelings that's okay we'll um we can take that on board what about you guys I think for me is there is no script often when you have these prep programs very structured approach and you have this lovely framework and all of those things I think we learned very early on in the piece and I suspected the same for you guys in council that all of that kind of goes out the window because every individual's situation is different and the impact is different so the the response to them has to be different so I love that you know for me it's around being able to provide a bespoke service delivery and that's not necessarily something that that we have been used to in the um prescription around did I suddenly go mute give me giving me the buttons saying that you've talked but it's that piece around ensuring that to the extent that we can that what we're providing is a service that meets an individual's needs um because if we're meeting individual needs the knock-on effect is that we will start to meet community needs because that will support individuals then be able to function and be part of their community moving forward so for me the that there are some absolutes and that's fine but the reality is it's about that bespoke piece for every individual or family yeah I've noticed that in our discussions outside of sort of we obviously don't talk about you know individual resident residential issues but even coming forward and just even if this feels so small to you and having that person to talk to and that collective understanding that there's a trend there we can pick up on that and we have these discussions online about what are the trends that you're seeing how can we assist community and that's what we're talking about recovery networks and social recovery subcommittees and things like that is it gets fed into it not your individual story of course but those noticeable trends and then and it sort of paints a larger picture for everyone so even if you feel like you're not making much of a difference your journey or your story's not big enough or you don't really know what to do with it even just sharing that with in the community as well and I think where that's been a real value for council has been we've been out of feedback to council what individuals again not by by name but in terms of the themes and those things so it means that the council staff when they get a call have a degree of preparedness around what can I expect what does that look like um and I think that that all services have done a great job in understanding that and working with that um and upscaling and I think where we are today as opposed to two years ago there's been some significant growth in those areas we'll always mug it up from time to time that's human nature but I think in the main there's a much more consistent message and a much more consistent approach to respecting individuals individual needs and requirements now that that's not just uh I think in the recovery for end with council but certainly uh the public health network and local health district and certainly state government so that's part up through government and certainly that's kim's role uh to speed that information back up to federal government so that though that information that understanding of what's happening on the ground is being sent up to the people who need to hear it and when you have people like michelle and I who are a bit like sledgehammers we make sure they hear it I don't know what they'll do about it I don't know what you mean know I'm very subtle aren't we all sort of different one of the things that I've really learned throughout this is around the huge level of grief that comes with the change to environment for people and it's something that should be really obvious but maybe it wasn't as obvious to me when I first started is that one of the things that has really really impacted even for people who lost their home one of the things I greet the most is a change to the environment and I think it's part of that decision around does a person to go back as well because it is a different blockchain that they're going back to in a different environment um there's a security that comes from having sometimes an environment around your national environment and the wildlife and things there so that's been a huge a huge source of grief for the community members that we've worked with and it's been one of the things that has helped us to connect with our community is providing opportunities for environmental regeneration um which has been fantastic because then when those people have come in let's look then we hear about what else is happening the other needs that people have as well we've been able to provide support for those needs and get in touch with their recovery support centers which has been great um what some of those things that you mentioned before so those trends that you're identifying and the things you're hearing from the recovery support service go a long way to informing things like our vulture recovery and resilience plan and some of the training that we disaster recovery training for our laundry council staff based on some of the feedback that we've heard from residents um to get that across the board um so I'd like to be you know that's um because so many stuff within council are working in the starts to recovery so there's also an element of self-care and for a lot of our residents all of our staff are also local residents as well so just encouraging them to have that self-care through the process um that's been some of the big learnings and it's I think just really that the importance of all of these networks adapting and services working together and for me one of the things that I'm really conscious of going forward is that we need to upskill our different community organizations to give them the confidence to work in disaster recovery that's something that tanya and I spoke a lot about in recent weeks is around at the moment that the bulk of the work is sort of going to specialize disaster recovery services but as the frequency to be aware of that impact and really now I think for us we have a responsibility to to work across the service sector in our you know lgas to support them to feel more confident to work in disaster delivery because I think to any any specialised service will have a limited time that's the nature of what they are they're a specialist service so the more we can support community to manage those processes to the extent they can themselves but the more the more strength I have yeah definitely oh I'm still in charge of it I think we've only got about five minutes to go is there anything else we wanted to talk about to wrap it up I think I've covered everything on my clearly we've done an exceptional job because nobody's asked any questions so um does anyone have any questions that they would like to ask for the recovery support service or they're online so we will uh community links wellbeing will continue to be part of their just not discovery well we'll discover recovery it's disaster and recovery together as discovery we'll continue to be part of that journey with you um in hopefully a variety of forms because hopefully we'll get lots of funding to do this work it's been a real privilege for michelle raylen and I to be part of this journey with you we really um can't_''_8688.319 say enjoyed but I think we've grown and loved getting to know people and to you know with love being welcomed into your space um and to support you as you've needed it it's been um a really lovely experience it's been a heartbreaking experience it's been a very uplifting experience all the emotions all the fields I just wanted to really say thank you from um council point of view um I get amazing feedback about the recovery support service and the work that they've done all the time um I've been there firsthand and seen the amazing work that they've done as well when they've been able to provide support to people um link them in on their behalf as well just made such um impact on the community so thank you all so much and it's again even just on friday I had a really lovely conversation with the resident about the amazing support they received from the recovery support service and I think just to have these people on the ground I call them disaster recovery personal assistance because they can just take away some of those tasks because there's so many tasks there's so many little jobs and little decisions and conversations and things and recovery is happening while people are working full-time with their parenting taking their kids to school and sport so just to have you guys to help take some that burden on people's shoulders so that they can walk towards their recovery has been amazing I think through this event it's been a really good illustration of the number of supports that are out there from the practical rebuild through to mental health and psychosocial so part of our job is to know who those people are so you don't need to remember we ask we'll ask someone somebody does know um so we'll get on to that for you so that's part of and as michelle said as it changes as that adapts and evolves we can keep across that because it's really hard to know who's who and as people change their roles or um legislation or guidelines change and that's part of what we do is keeping on top of that so I think that takes us almost to the end of our time so I just want to thank everyone for the participation today thank you all for tuning in um thank you so much for the recovery support service and ray who couldn't make it this day we just have to acknowledge her as well all the three of you are just incredible in this space I know I've learned a lot and you've actually supported me in supporting others as well so not only do they support community they also support supporters so you guys have been incredible in this space um kim do you have anything to so much to everybody for their time really appreciate sorry tanya do you mean to scare you there you just jumped out of yourself it's quite loud um no thank you to everybody uh who's been in this space um there's also obviously a heap of resources on council's website under the expo link so please feel free to jump on there at any time you'll find you know contact numbers email um contacts as well as websites and various other information to help people in this space so and feel free to reach out to I've put in the chat as well contact details for natalie corrine myself and also for community links so if you or anybody else that you know still needs any help along their journey please reach out at any time we're all here to help and support you um you know for as long as we're in this space so please do so thank you to everybody thank you okay so we're just going to play a short video from the which was filmed in phn grant which is a song called don't let it burn which is made by a local family from orangeville who were impacted by the fires and patrick gillistein who was online earlier um had supported was one of the organizations who led that project um through river road and it's a really great video so I just want to share this and um and just acknowledge the really fantastic talented young people here and the fact that they share their story and when my questions uh oh but I won't let it go oh lady but I wanna hey foreign um know um uh so a big thank you to river road and wildflower holistics who have read that stories of regeneration projects and we're just going to now share a video from the ses who put together this video for our response recovery and resilience exhibition good morning everybody my name is colin malone the acting assistant commissioner of regional operations uh it's an honor to be joining you here today as to start by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land of which we are meeting on today being virtual I note that these are varied and today I'm joining you from the lands of the gundam people in goldman I'd like to pay my respects to elders past present and emerging and I'd extend that respect to aboriginal and torres strait islander people who are joining us today today we're going to talk a little bit about the new south wales ses and how we work with communities before during and after flood events but it's equally applicable across all emergency events that we look after the new south wales ses is an emergency and rescue service dedicated to assisting the community we're a volunteer based organisation that provides emergency assistance to people in new south wales 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year our volunteers are our true strength as of all organisation the strength of an organisation is its people ours come from all walks of life bringing with them many different skills interests and backgrounds from purpose of supporting their communities in times of need while our major responsibilities are flood storm and tsunamis the new south wales scs provides the majority of general land rescue effort in rural parts of new south wales these include such things as road crash rescue vertical rescue bush search and rescue evidence searches other rescues such as domestic and industrial rescue and support to other emergency organizations new south wales emergency management arrangements are based off an all hazard all agency approach in times of need we're there to help the other emergency services and other agencies of new south wales this includes such thing as searches with the police providing support to the rural fire service during major fire events and support to other emergency services when the things we can offer will help them achieve their outcome support new south wales ambulance as one example of that through the provision of community first responder in some of the remote rural parts of new south wales and public access to tribulation in many units across the state but let's talk a little bit about the flooding of you be aware the flooding does occur there flash flooding is one of the most common types of flooding we see in that area it's not all about the major rivers that flow through the lgas flash flooding is is a very high risk in that area we've seen it happen before and we'll see it happen again in places like picton barrel barometer and but it's not just these locations flash flooding occurs when we see a heavy down burst of rain it breaks the creeks or it comes over land and goes across roads and that local rainfall over the highlands can can trigger this flash flooding as runoff in the past the new south wales ses has performed numerous flood rescues supported by our partner agencies across the windsor caribbean willandelli local government area many of these unfortunately are as a result of people making decisions to enter that flood water when driving and that results in an emergency response that puts both the person's life at risk and the responders life at risk to come and help them we really safe preparing the community for flooding is a key aspect of what we do there's more to emergency management than just responding and in fact a primary goal of the ses is to minimize response we know that sounds a little bit odd that we're an emergency service organization we want to minimize response but ultimately if we can work with our partners through an approach that sees them well prepared knowing what to do and when to do it they'll be well resilient and ready to look after themselves in times of need and we won't need to respond we do this for a comprehensive approach and that's underpinned by prevention preparedness response when required and then recovery after the event the new south wales ses recognizes the importance of working with our communities to better enable them to enhance their resilience to national disasters however this approach is based on us partnering with those communities and working with them to inform consult involve collaborate and empower it's not just about us we don't have all the answers about every part of's what we're responsible for but we also know that it's about working with people we do this using a ground-up approach to work with individual community specific needs with the goal to have the community involved in the planning process it's fair to say even within the winter caribbean will be rolling dearly local government areas that there are many small communities that make up those local government areas there are some big towns there's some small towns and there's some villages each of them have their own unique differences and it's really important as we work through these processes to help prepare communities and work with them get to the response stage and again have them partner with us that we've understood really what are those differences and what are the specific risks a typical process when we work with communities involve such things as understanding the local risk to each of those elements of the community this looks at how people live how they work how they play in those local government areas what it is about that local government why is it different some of the things we look at is how do they connect how do they meet how do they share and come together where do they meet when they need to come together is it a local hall is it a local community center is it the local pub in some really small communities that people corral around in times of need we like to understand how that all works what bri what is the glue that makes up that community through this we're building relationships networks and connections within and across those communities so that we have a shared understanding from that point we can co-create with those communities to develop shared resources which are targeted to the specific needs and in some cases we'll identify some priorities of how we'll work together we work with local groups to identify strengths and weaknesses of the community and work to find solutions that are practical maintainable and service the community needs we've all heard on the news from emergency services such as ours and our partner agencies that there are just not a team at every house on every corner in every emergency it's just not practical to be resourced to that level every single event so it is all about working together when responding to our incidents we like to and we use existing local community connections and networks this starts with the local emergency management committee but it doesn't finish there it's about understanding who else in the community we can work with these ongoing partnerships enable us to plan prepare and respond in collaboration with communities and following a continual cycle of community capability building with the community some examples of this include different sporting groups and different groups within the community that we know are willing ready and able to come forward and help in times of need this breaks the traditional thinking the traditional thinking that disasters have been regarded historically as a government responsibility leading to agency ownership and community reliance on emergency services we can't_''_9749.6 be there all the time in every single instance and we know that the heart of our organization comes from volunteerism and volunteerism comes from local coordinated way that works with them so we can bring our resources our equipment our our services that the government provides to work with those community people this is all about reducing the impact of emergencies on communities by increasing that community ownership and building the community resilience this is especially relevant where there are low numbers of local volunteers one would say just recruit more but in some small towns when the population may only be 100 people or so and we've got 20 of those in the ses and those same people volunteer across multiple organizations such as the red cross the cwa the rural fire service and the list goes on there is only so much that people can stretch themselves so in those times it's all about how the community can band together know their risk know what's required of them know how they can help them work together to allow a timely response by the emergency service personnel the success of community-led approaches is often enhanced when existing and motivated community groups and resources can be activated or to redirect community spirit around many of the emergency service communication organizations it's so critical emergency management is something that is done with communities not to communities we really want to partner with our communities what do we look at after the event when the flood waters have receded or as they're receding what's our approach and how do we look to engage with the community recovery starts during the response it's it's really empowered by knowing the community knowing how do we help people return to a point of new normal after the flood waters have gone through once we get to the stage of having meetings and conducting surveys again it just brings us back to this strong focus on working with people we often will hold community forums and meetings with the affected members of the community it's critical here that we look at this through the lens of the people that live in their communities and their lived experience we know what our responders did we know what our emergency service partners did we know what we did when the warnings went out when when the all clears were issued what we don't understand often is the individual how did that particular flood in that particular street affect those individuals or that that street that neighborhood so we like to hear back from that it's more than just how high did the water get and which houses were affected to do this we look at the community and the ses response so what did happen we then like to hear feedback from the community what was their lived experience for the community to learn about the role of the ses in the flood quite often um no matter how much work we do in the lead-up to educating and working with communities there are still people out there that don't understand the different roles and again this is an opportunity for us to talk through that so that there's that shared understanding to from that point we look to identify and address any issues or concerns what went wrong what didn't go quite as well as it could have gone what happened that was beyond our control and what consider from that point there we plan a way forward and this is done not just with the ses and the community members this is about that local emergency management committee all the different stakeholders that we work together with including local council all the other emergency services and the functional areas that people often don't really realize that they're working in the background to help out things like the red cross and the welfare services that until you need them you don't really know they're there I'd just like to close that in speaking to you today it's about creating a shared understanding the role of the ses is about working with the community we're looking to engage with all of the community members and working collaboratively more information will be provided as part of this forum on how to find out more through our websites and other forums and when you see our volunteers out and about in the community in their orange driving our trucks responding throughout your areas and we do acknowledge in winter caribbe especially there's lots want to remind everybody that our volunteers are your volunteers live in your community they're members of your community and that they are your community as well so thank you for today have a wonderful forum so thank you colin malone who's the acting assistant commissioner for regional operations for the new south wales state emergency services that was a great way to wrap up the expo we have heard from a number of combat agencies and the response agencies as well as our recovery services in the area that have been operating since the not only since the bushfire but also since our flood and storm events that have impacted recently a huge thank you to everybody for coming along um I'd also like to say a huge thank you to kim hill from the national recovery and resilience agency who's put together a lot of what you've seen this weekend so huge thank you to kim you put together a really great panel of speakers a really great resource for the community going forward in their recovery so a huge thank you to pull this weekend together and we're

Good afternoon this is a post summary of the council meeting that happened last night it was a really interesting night for us because it was the first time we went paperless and things went quite smoothly considering it was a new system some of the main items that we discussed last night from the planning area there was some discussion about temporary food premises policy but because there was some implications that could have made restrictions on some of our volunteers and our people that raised funds we've decided to defer that for the moment we adopted the Volland early development control plan which regulates vegetation removal controls that had been back to exhibition twice and we didn't have anybody make any extra additions to those there were two voluntary planning agreements that went through one related to 790 Montpellier Drive the oaks and also 165 River Road tom wall both had significant developer contributions and well we'd always like more that event is negotiated as we can so hopefully we'll see some great things in those areas some traffic upgrades were passed and some on were on B Road just to improve the pedestrian safety some of the notices of motion that were put up by councillors related to writing a letter to the New South Wales attorney general and local member joelle asking for upgrades to the picton courthouse anybody that's around here which is so morning would appreciate that many of the people are standing outside and there's not a lot of room if you're against somebody then you're literally sitting next to them outside we've got increased population and we need and some improvement in that area we were looking at the water restrictions and we've decided that it's probably time that water restrictions were imposed upon this area most of you out there would probably think when you turn the tap on that your water comes from where gamba Dam that's certainly the case for the people that live in where gamba but for the rest of the Shire most of our our water comes from the Penn Avon and corridor dams water restrictions you usually only put in place when the obviously where gamba has most of the water so well that might be an average we could be really really low on our water for this area and still no restrictions in place we'd prefer their restrictions to come in earlier rather than later there was also notices of motion put forward relating to aged care making sure there's enough packages for our people at home that need that care to be delivered not having to wait til somebody else passes away for some stuff to be freed up we talked about gyros retirement for politics council branding and a waiving your fears for a new program called alive alive is a program that's been put together by a whole lot of community members being run by picked in high school principal and this is where we're going to hopefully take some young people who don't really achieve very well at school putting them in an off-site situation with some schooling with some TAFE and perhaps some work experience and to find out more of these issues or have a look in more in more actually see on the council website you can actually go back and have a look at what actually happened in the council meeting thank you
Good morning everyone and welcome to the response recovery and resilience expo proudly brought to you by wollon dilly shy council winter caribbean council resilience new south wales and the national recovery and resilience agency my name is natalie and I'm the community recovery officer at wollongeally shire council good morning I'm corinne buxton community recovery officer for windshield caribbea council good morning I'm kim hill and I'm the recovery support officer with the national recovery and resilience agency we're just going to start the morning with an acknowledgement of country from melissa wyatt from wider caribbean council on behalf of winter cabby shire council and willendale shire council I would like to acknowledge the gun and darawa people as they are the traditional custodians of the land on which we live and work I acknowledge the spiritual connections to the land waters and sky I like to pay my respect to the ancestors our elders past and present and to the future generations I'd also like to extend that respect to all aboriginal and torres strait islander people that are watching today in so as you all may be aware this event originally was due to be scheduled as a face-to-face event however unfortunately with the ongoing kobit 19 restrictions in new south wales we have shifted the event to a virtual event so thank you all for joining us on zoom um to our presenters from across the state and to all of our um registered participants from across the state as well particularly our local residents in walla dillon caribbe shire we will be hosting this event next year face to face in april and we're really looking forward to building on this virtual schedule that we have here and delivering that as uh as a as a full face-to-face event with exhibitors and conference presentations and the opportunity for people to meet and interact with the different services that are participating and to access all the great information that we have coming to you over there throughout the content as well we're going to start our official presentations this morning with a video from the new south wales rfs commissioner rob rogers hi I'm rob rogers commissioner having me here today to talk a little bit about resilience in the context of bushfire and resilience is obviously more than bushfire but one of the big impact things that has happened to the state as that 2019-20 bushfire season that impacted on so many people across the state and the recovery of that and the resilience of the community was really important part of that so I want to talk a little bit about the operation and then of course the resilience and recovery components of that so firstly that fire season at a glance it's important to remember more than 160 days of continuous major operations in our state operations centre 200 consecutive days of what we call a section 44 which is basically like an emergency fire situation for the rfs so more than 200 days of that eleven thousand three hundred fires across that period of time five and a half million hectares of bush land burnt an extraordinary amount of uh vegetation destroyed during that fire season which we haven't seen before three state of emergency declarations made by the premier and 59 days of total fire ban 11 days of statewide total fire bans six and a half thousand interstate and inter national personnel to help us fight those fires and I i guess the most telling 26 fatalities 2400 homes destroyed and 15 000 homes saved and if you compare that with other fire seasons going back to the 1993-94 year you can just see how big the impact is compared to previous seasons so it's really a watershed time when you consider fire seasons it's set a completely new benchmark of what what could occur in fire throughout new south wales and obviously the new benchmark is going to be that 2019-25 season you can see on this map the total area burnt and it and it's clearly a lot of these fires originated in the mountainous areas lightning strikes but burnt then to the coast and and we saw that in the northern part of the state the southern part of the state and you can see just how much of new south wales was blackened from those fires and these fires crossed the borders south wales and on of course and I shouldn't forget about the act it certainly crossed there as well following that fire as you would expect when it's impacted on so many people the government in initiate a review into the fires and certainly the new south wales government initiated a review which was from former police deputy commissioner dave owens and former chief scientist mary o'kaine so they looked at the inquiry they conducted a quiry into those fires and they made a number of recommendations indeed they made 76 recommendations and a further 109 sub recommendations and they're all about what trying to learn what we did well what we can improve on and indeed what we need to do to make sure that the rfs and indeed the community is ready for another fire of that magnitude sometime in the future and that's really what it's about it's not about fault finding it's trying to understand what works what didn't and what we need to do better next time and you know for our organization we're a people that lost homes or lost loved ones will expect that they expect that people learn lessons from things like this and we obviously try and make sure we do even better but I'm incredibly proud of the work that both the firefighters from all the agencies that came together but also everybody behind the scenes the the police the the ambulance but importantly the community and the community made a big difference here because they had that level of resilience in some of the communities and and having some of the areas better prepared and more supported makes firefighters jobs enormously easy compared to somewhere where either the community's not there or they haven't done any preparation and they're not there engaged and supporting each other so you cannot overestimate the importance of a well-prepared and resilient community and that's obviously a theme of what we're talking here so I guess it's important and you can just see how important that is when you see the number of places that have been saved and that a large part is obviously firefighters but windsor caribbea area from that fire season so in and wallendilly there were 16 homes destroyed and 17 damage windsor caribou 68 destroyed and a further 18 damaged but that was a lot of out buildings as well that were destroyed they're not just homes but that's a perfect example of areas that could have been a lot worse if it wasn't_''_525.68 for the responsiveness of those communities and making sure that they prepared their home they had a bushfire survival plan whether it's formal or informal they had a plan and they did some preparatory work ahead of time just to make sure they understood and made sure that their property is in the best possible shape to withstand fire and one of the other things is to make sure that they're connected with neighbours and that they not just le everyone for themselves if if everybody collaborates and make sure they help each other in that preparation but also when the fire impacts knowing where people that might be vulnerable live making sure you look out for them in those sort of instances and fire agencies and police and ambulance will do everything they can and our focus is clearly on saving lives but we can't_''_576.399 be everywhere at every time we need the community to work with us so this again I i think reinforces that whole thing about resilience of community and and obviously being the eyes and ears of the fire agencies and that helps us enormously letting us know where fires are so we can get our warnings so it's really important and and I think that hopefully that will be part of the themes that come through this conference is making sure that you know that importance is there uh and I think also the community coming together after the fires and we're seeing a picture here of the playground of buxton to memorialize um andrew and jeff and the loss of them and there's some a beautiful memorial there and that's that's community driven and a big shout out to kim and I know who's there who was very instrumental in making this happen but but look that's been goes to show that people genuinely care and they want to make a difference and and they certainly have made a difference there and but again and that's that's part of recovery because the community recovering the firefighters recovering enables um them to be ready for the next challenge and so the community certainly played a part there in talking about the season outlook now um we're in obviously a lot better situation than we were in that 2019-20 but notwithstanding that fire is always going to occur they always happen and indeed there's 50 or 60 fires every day that happens throughout the state so you just don't hear about them because firefighters get on top of them very quickly but the grassland areas are the big risk for us over last year and this year because we've had extraordinary rainfall right throughout the state and then that's obviously caused a lot of grass to grow and that's not just out in the west obviously east of the ranges as well there's grassland areas and and a lot of de-stocking drought people got rid of all their stock and that hasn't yet been rectified so there's a lot of growth out there and that's obviously our focus so if that rainfall does stop then january february we're going to be quite concerned about what the potential for grass fires are and irrespective of grass fires it only takes a couple of really warm days and we'll still have bush fires and those bushfires can cause devastation they might not be the same size as 2019 20 but at the end of the day if your home's in the middle of them and in the path of them it really doesn't matter how big the bushfire is if it's going to impact you you still need to prepare so don't be complacent you can see here the three-month outlook and at the moment the outlook is still positive from a rainfall point of view we're still going to see more rain on the coast and and obviously hopefully that keeps falling because that'll keep that grassland areas as I mentioned isn't you can see here some of the areas throughout the state where some of the grass growth is uh extraordinarily heavy and and these in these areas on that map show the the more than average areas so you can see it's not just one part of the state there's quite a number of areas that have significant growth and those red areas and the orange areas they can carry very fast-moving and quite ferocious fires you can see here some of the work that the rfs has been doing outside of firefighting and that is particularly about covert helping those agencies and those communities with covert certainly supporting health helping set up things like base camps helping with food deliveries for communities that are isolated supporting people like ses for floods helping those communities with floods our aviation and our people go out and help supporting police in their operations we sent crews to canada to help them with fires and also to western australia with cyclone support there and you can see some of the some of the people that um have been involved in the rfs and I think one of the really good things about the people in the rfs is they're representative of their local community so they're part of that resilience message for the local community so becoming part of the rfs is about becoming resilient in your community because you're providing more people to help more people in that local area or further afield so one of the big things you can do to help your community be more resilient is becoming involved in the rfs doesn't mean you have to be a firefighter but being involved helps teach you those skills about looking after your own home and your own family but also helping your broader community some of the capability uh things you'll see there is is what we're doing and on the left you'll see that there's a new building an aviation center of excellence which is about some of our simulators building a building which will be the first bits type anywhere in the country to house aviation facilities to train a new generation of uh particularly that control all the aircraft firefighting over a fire and we need to bring more of those people on board aviation firefighting is becoming a bigger component of our operations and we need to make sure we've got the right number of people we always run out of them so this is something we want to put a neck uh focus on you might remember in those fires where we had those red maps where we thought fires were going to impact on particularly bad days we're going to look at improving that bringing that into fires near me and also we've got some jets that we've bought that will do specialized mapping to try and get maps out to people quicker so that people understand uh where these fires are and again an informed community is a better prepared community so that's part of that and all and also we're doing predetermined dispatch so that's when we first in certain areas where we first get a fire we respond at the same time a fire truck we respond uh an aircraft so't let them take hold we're also looking at new advancements in bushfire management and looking at things like artificial intelligence with regards to plotting fires working out what's mo at most risk and looking at a new generation of how we use technology to help protect people so we're doing that new mapping systems as I as I mentioned with our citation aircraft a bit better mapping to the community and to fire managers so a lot of work is going on in that regards also our mitigation crews helping to protect communities there's a lot of work that they're doing around the state actually protecting communities helping to create fire breaks behind those communities and particularly some of those vulnerable areas in rural new south wales some of the towns were really vulnerable and putting in breaks between the bush and those towns makes a huge difference for the sustainability and and resilience of those communities and new bushfire risk plans are something that we're doing since those fires and it's a whole new generation of plans right around the state bushfire risk plan everywhere throughout new south wales and this is really about saying what's at risk how we are treating that risk what are we doing about it and then if that risk does get realised and we have a fire how are we going to put that fire out quickly bringing all the agencies together to make sure we're all working together so these new plans are a new generation plan and again with a lot more technology involved to try and make sure that we suppress these fires very quickly the government's also introduced some new things boundary clearing code and that's again about enabling people to be resilient on their own property so people in rural areas so that it can clear prop vegetation on their boundary up to 25 metres and this again just makes them able to stop fire entering their property or fire leaving their property and it's about disrupting the fuel so this enables people with a very little amount of bureaucracy to basically self-assess and if they qualify for that scheme go out and do that of fire management and where it's an appropriate thing and there's no you know significant environmental risks allowing people to go in and do that work also fire trails are a massive uh issue for us trying to make sure we've got fire trails in the right spot to where we know fires occur to try and disrupt fire paths make sure it's safe for firefighters so we're not going to send firefighters down a road that doesn't have turnarounds so it becomes quite a risky proposition so we're spending a government spending an enormous amount of money millions of dollars on fire trials trying to make sure they're appropriate and then fire behaviour training so training a new generation of fire behavior analysts to make sure the gain that we're clearly looking at risk looking at fire potential where's the fire going to go what communities are going to impact and make sure we put all our our people onto those fires some of the things that we did there's an enormous outpouring of donations to the rfs was um donated now that goes into a dedicated trust to ensure that the money that comes in gets spent on our firefighters and we've been very clear on that it's about helping frontline people and these listing here is some of the different programs and and certainly some of these are using the donated money others are things that governments funded but some of the helmets new helmets new generation helmets we're looking at better rollover protection for our trucks governments invested that basically doubled our program of uh reinvestment in the fleet to try and get a a newer generation of truck with safer rollover systems the halo protection for our people to make sure that everybody is as safe as we can make them and you can see there just some of the types of things that we're looking at and this is dispatch systems there's a new fire danger rating system so you'll see some changes to that the the uh signs you see beside the road that indicate fire danger that's all being reviewed and new south wales projects there that as you can see and I won't go through them all that will just showing how we're changing the the face of what the rfs is doing and how it's doing and to try and make sure again we're ready to meet the next significant fire season going forward and then the future you can see there that this is all about resilient communities partnerships with other like organisations and making sure that our membership is well resourced connected technology wise and and they have the right stations and the right equipment to use because at the end of the day if we make the rfs resilient that in turn helps make our community resilient and I think that that's in our all of our interests so I guess my message to people in closing is to be resilient in your local community help your local community prepare make sure you are prepared make sure what you and your family know what you're going to do if a fire starts in the vicinity you're going to stay and defend your're going to leave where you're going to go have alternate ways of going there and I think work together to understand the vulnerability of your community and make sure that again as I said before help each other don't it's not everyone for themselves this is about a community coming through these things so work together make sure that you help each other and most of all look after each other because homes can be rebuilt any infrastructure can be rebuilt but lives can't_''_1341.919 be and even people who get serious injuries from fire they're things that are life-changing and they're things that will be with someone forever so we don't want people hurt if we need to lose homes we lose homes but lives are the absolute most important thing so please enjoy the rest of the conference and please do that preparatory work I mentioned on your home and help your neighbors and most of all stay safe thanks very much for having me so a huge thank you to commissioner rob rogers for putting that video together for us the response recovery and resilience expo so this is day two today of the expo and we are recording all the sessions that so that they can be watched back in the future by people unable to attend online and that they'll be there as a resource for the future as well so the the need for this expo um did originally I guess stem from the 2019-20 bushfires however the wall and jelly in which caribbean have both experienced a number of disaster events in recent times that really highlight the need for us to be prepared and the need for us to to share the information they're going to use people on their recovery journey as well so a huge thank you to rob rogers for that video um we will also we have shared in the chat today the information around some of our local mental health services I think you took her in for sharing that information there there may be some imagery in some of the presentations today that will possibly be quite triggering for people so just a reminder that there are that can assist people through um through those feelings that they might be experiencing after seeing some imagery of these disaster events um just an acknowledgement that we have gone through some recent disaster events as well that are in the very very early days of recovery in shy with the severe stall event that we've experienced recently I will now hand over to green beautiful I'd like to now welcome dominic lane from resilience new south wales dominic lane is currently the executive director operational management and partnership for brazilians new south wales dominic oversees and leads resilience new south wales operational support during a major crisis and recovery working in partnership with the brazilians new south wales local coordination and service delivery division and other emergency management agencies and co-delivery partners dominic was chief executive of the south australian fire and emergency services commission and chair of the sa safe com board dominic has held a range of management and senior executive functions in the new south wales world fire service he was appointed commissioner of the act emergency services agency in 2013 and held that good governance and deep commitment to to contributing to improved resilience and recovery outcomes a connection to community partnerships and a strong sense of service as a senior public sector leader welcome dominic well thank you very much for the introduction hopefully I'm coming through okay I do seem to be having a bit of trouble with bandwidth this morning so just checking if I can just get a thumbs up from natalie or someone that you can hear me okay thanks oh good dominic we can hear you thank you very much thanks for that uh look um as as you know resilience new south wales many of you would be aware is a new organization um we've we've borne out of the ashes in many ways of the 2019-20 uh bushfire season so I will be reflecting a little bit on some of the areas that commissioner rogers did cover uh but I think it's very important because at this time we're very much trying to work out how we go ahead and we can't_''_1586.159 do that without looking back uh from this opportunity to speak at at this wonderful initiative and a big thanks to our partners wallindilly and ridgid caribbean councils and of course the national recovery and resilience agency so um with that it's certainly a privilege and if we can just reflect um over to the next one going forward a couple of slides there too to our state map and the compounding disasters within new south wales and as rob rogers mentioned before the unprecedented um 2019-20 bushfire season in some ways wasn't a surprise and as we saw uh throughout and well basically from my recollection it really started back in 2018 extremely dry spring and early summer and whilst uh the season wasn't that uh significant by the time we got to august 2019 uh all of the indicators were there in relation to a very challenging uh summer ahead excuse me and so what you can see there is the seasonal outlooks that the australasian foreign emergency services authorities put together in collaboration with the bureau of meteorology and the bushfire natural has its uh cooperative research center to see the look at it from a nationwide perspective uh it certainly played out and from um from the two years I had in south australia as the chief executive of the south australian foreign emergency services commission we certainly saw the impact of that across um southeast and south australia as well as of course uh kangaroo uh ireland and so if we move forward as the season unfolded you'll recall on the next slide we were in those drought conditions in many parts of new south wales in august 2019 we saw the impact really starting to come through and again not only in new south wales but as I mentioned before uh queensland was already having significant fire operations by then and by august 21 lgas had already commenced their bushfire danger period which of course is quite significant when you consider the statutory bushfire danger period normally starts at the beginning of october and so as we go into went into september of 2019 we saw the significance of these events starting to unfold on the next slide in relation to how we can the impact in with uh significant fires already starting in what's called that first section 444 declaration that rob talked about as well as then going into september we got to the stage in new south wales where there was already 1 300 bush and grass fires and already as I said before before the normal start of the bushfire season uh four total fire ban days declared and then into october uh the story really started to unfold as you would be aware across the mid-north coast and into closer into sydney with the um the trigger of the most significant gospels mountain fire and of course at that stage started to see significant impact including fatalities so throughout november we had new south wales had its first catastrophic fire danger ratings in across um the heavily impacted areas of sydney the hunter and the illawarra shoalhaven including into the walindi rigid caribbea areas and those fires across the mid-north coast continued uh to expand and impact and then and by the by the time december came around the impact was definitely impinging on all of us with those um catastrophic recall whether we were in new south wales or as I said from myself in south australia uh the impact was starting to be seen in many many parts of the nation uh and then into january um the the real impact started to um hit into southern new south wales and fortunately by february we started to see some respite even though from a resilience new south wales perspective there started to be some significant impact in relation to what we were starting to see from a flooding perspective all of a sudden and that's just the vagaries of the weather that we sometimes are impacted by but then just moving forward to the next slide and hopefully that's coming up in a minute as rob said he gave some of those statistics in relation to the significant impact across new south wales nearly um nearly 12 000 fires um high intensity operations that went particularly for the rural fire service for 160 days and those bushfire emergencies and that were declared for over 200 days you know nearly five to six months and and the impact will catch up in a minute if we can just go to the next one thank you very much I'm sorry dominic we've um we're up the I'm wondering if this might be a bit of delay we just had the slide with the maps after the stitching oh great thank you sorry uh it's a bit of a delay at my end and so I think the map just demonstrates the impact between yeah so uh beyond the statistics yeah as I've mentioned so the map obviously um we always try and plan from a fire and emergency services perspective in relation to the uh predicted outcomes uh but unfortunately the impact as you can see from what uh where the potential danger was uh certainly unfolded in relation to that map and then if we can just go on to the next slide as well then thanks be on the map the one after the map uh and the damage that was um impacted and significantly um very significantly within uh while on dealing in widget caribbean as well as we know thousand two and a half that uh two and a half thousand homes destroyed um uh significantly as commissioner rogers I mentioned but lots of significant saves across new south wales and some it's it's it's um estimated some fifteen 000 homes were directly saved by the firefighting operations which is an incredibly impressive effort by the emergency services of new south wales but as we also know billions of dollars of damage not only to homes and livelihoods but of course across primary production the agriculture sector was significantly hit as well as a significant impact on the forestry industry and many many regional businesses and hopefully my slide my my computer is just being a bit slow here but if we can just keep clicking through the slides um to also acknowledge um the tragic loss that did occur uh over the 19 20 season south australia in some ways um was a little fortunate but of course suffered three horrendous um fatalities as part of the firefighting operations and so within new south wales those 26 people that were killed including the seven firefighters through that terrible period uh so if we can just keep moving through thank you so as we know at the height of the activity um as mentioned before more than two and a half thousand firefighters in the field each shift two hundred thousand firefighting shifts across those uh nearly 12 000 firefighters but if we can just keep scrolling through we'll see some of those images of the fact that our firefighters not only came from within new south wales but also supported from across australia uh as part of the interagency effort so whether it was uh fine rescue new south wales the national parks and wildlife service the forestry commission as well as the volunteer agencies of the ses and of course the rfs alongside our paramedic colleagues and many others that helped out it was a true interagency effort and of course led to significant strengthening of collaboration and coordination which we'll see and I'll talk to a little bit more in terms of our our current operations uh and supported um as you would be aware by uh an australian effort uh we could just keep clicking through the slides um had continuous shifts into northern uh and and new south wales until um until just before from late september until just before christmas when of course we started to be impacted over there by our own significant firefighting operations but um so we had the interstate um the interest rate as well as the international effort uh that helped and uh and people coming from all over the world which um is a really significant outcome and so a big you know all we know as a community a big thanks to our firefighters in the field and all of those that supported them around that at the time um but moving more towards now um the role of resilience new south wales and the fact that it was born out of the this very significant operation uh the unprecedent precedented fire event has led to the unprecedented uh recovery effort and one of the things that we're very proud of within resilience new south wales is that we're able to support events like today which are all of what the community is going through so whether it's in relation to uh the more than eight thousand people again record amounts of people that were provided with emergency accommodation the work that's been done in relation to the establishment of the temporary accommodation pods which we continue to still work through and the various recovery support services that resilience new south wales in partnership with our commonwealth colleagues and our local government colleagues we've been able to establish so one of the big things that we're very proud of is also the um establishment of the 22 community recovery officers of which um our local ones on the ground in wellington widget caribou continue to do fantastic work and it's great to see the partnership that we have with councils in relation to their ongoing work and the fact that in many parts of the state we're able to extend their roles for a little bit longer to help people through many things big supports in relation to we just go to some of the next slides thank you very much in bushfire local and economic recovery fund with our commonwealth partners and the industry recovery packages that we've been able to establish particularly for some of those areas devastated and devastatingly impacted as part of that as we know more than all those um because of the devastating impact more than 3600 properties cleaned up and again a good coordination effort across government but also with our private sector counterparts and a really good collaboration across all of those sorts of things and then moving on in relation to the work of our accommodation pods it's something that was born by necessity and very much an example of our way we're partnering going forward and the work that's been done in relation to working with our community partners which I'll talk to a little bit later on this has been extremely significant and so whilst many of us would be aware that the pods aren't exactly luxurious accommodation they've been born by necessity to provide support to those people that allow people to stay on their property that has been devastatingly impacted while while by some of those other compounding issues that we've been dealing with so um so just to reflect again in terms of the 500 million dollar bushfire local economic recovery fund the 22 recovery offices the recovery support services and the face-to-face efforts to support more than 5000 people families and the like has certainly helped and alongside of that is some of those community-led projects that we're very proud of as well in terms of uh and again in the in the um the face of uh you know what came next in relation to not only the impacts of uh the fires itself but as we all aware um the ongoing severe storms and floods and the covert 19 pandemic so I'll just make sure if someone can just tell me because I think I think my slides are still a bit slow on my screen which slide you have up there now kim sure dominic so we've got the one up there about the flood recovery oh great thank you very much excellent um so not a big surprise to people in terms already been mentioned whilst uh bushfire has been the most significant in recent times the severe storms of march and april uh 2021 reminds us once again that it's not all just about bushfires and so when you consider the the significant impact that was occurred one of the things we're very proud of within resilience new south wales is this became a true whole of government effort built upon our experiences from the bushfires which led to rapid damage assessments of properties um immediate cleanup and assistance with the through the collaboration of our foreign emergency services colleagues along with uh importantly our partners from the australian defence force uh we're able to very quickly stand up some of our flood help and assistance in relation to that and in record time commence some of the funding packages uh in again in partnership with our commonwealth colleagues to support our primary producers and our other community members impacted by that and so from that as we know um and if you just go to the next slide in terms of some of that work and that government coordination effort and for the first time uh we saw an immediate response an immediate transition uh and and a linking coordination between uh immediate response to the actual impact of the disaster standing up the relief efforts are required in things like emergency accommodation and simultaneously starting the cleanup and getting the funding packages out with the support of our colleagues so so once again a big thanks to our emergency services colleagues the wonderful work of the state emergency service but supported by our fire services in the australian defense force one of the other things of course as part of that was the um efforts to establish community recovery centers across new south wales and so in um um and I'll just bring um and just remind myself I think it was something like 22 um community recovery standards were up and running at one point in time to help um sorry relief centers to help personnel with evacuation which came down to them to eight recovery centers established from uh the sydney basin all the way up the mid-north coast and into the north fortunate in some ways it's unfortunate in others that we'll be able to um very much utilize our experienced personnel from the fire operations to uh expand their function straight into supporting people uh in the recovery systems but of course that hasn't been the last of it in terms of what new south wales has been impacted by this year and if we just move on again now thanks to the next slide um resilience new south wales has found itself in the middle of supporting the covet operation as well and particularly since uh the delta variant of the covet 19 virus has impacted on the state so very much from the early days of the delta outbreak resilience new south wales has already always had a support and relief role or since the beginning of cover to be honest to support people that have been forced into isolation under the public health orders to make sure that where possible we can provide food relief to those people that don't have the means to do so and that became very significant as we started impact as you would be aware on many people that are refugees people that work in many of the um in the economic areas that uh suffered immediately in terms of hospitality uber drivers transport drivers and those sort of things as a um we're impacted by the um by the lockdown and so we had to very much put in place whole of government support efforts in partnership with many of our charity partners such as food bank and as harvest and again with the support of our emergency services personnel to help with that delivery as well and in many ways that's now seen as one of the significant things that did support uh the people of southwest sydney more importantly as part of that process was once again uh ongoing partnerships with our local government colleagues that also allowed significant work to be done to support food and transport uh one of the more um telling stories was you probably saw in that earlier image that the semi-trailer parked at the front of um that building at will kenya um we made sure that from new south wales we established what we call the regional isolation care package which recognize many of our isolated communities in that part don't have the means to get other food to them click on delivery as we as you would have seen into places like will kenya is not as easy as it is for most of us so we're very proud of the work we're able to do to support our aboriginal communities in things like that from the early days of that particular outbreak the um and then moving on the response we've also partnered um not only with our food charities and the like but also worked very hard behind the scenes in terms of collaborating across government in support of getting grants out to any of our people um that that need assistance whether they've been aboriginal communities uh refugees people from non-english speaking backgrounds and the like to make sure uh that they can be supported through those those particularly tough times and it's very pleasing to say that much of that has passed us and if we's a summary slide of some of the covert response and some of the numbers that resilience new south wales working alongside our colleagues as commissioner rogers put up before the rfs has been significant but we've seen um it's been a partnership that's delivered more in an overall more than 3 400 tons of goods in other words about 80 fully loaded semi-trailers to get to people that in need through some of those things excuse me and so we're continuing to work uh part of that and as you would be all aware under the current covert operations whilst new south wales has done a tremendous job in relation to um getting our vaccination rates and reducing the numbers outbreaks still occur and some of our more vulnerable people particularly in remote and isolated parts of new south wales uh continued to be impacted by the covered response and so to this day in places like if we can just move forward I think there's a really good slide of the tumor basketball stadium where we work very closely with some of our take up to slide 32 there thanks um thanks kim um in relation to um the role of resilience new south wales it's beyond just bushfire it's beyond just recovery uh it's a very broad remit we've been given um so but uh and so after these acute disasters we have had the opportunity um to set and reflect it's as I said at the start of this presentation is why resilience new south wales was born we are working to transform the whole of government approach to disaster management in new south wales and our vision is to create resilient communities across the state and play an assurance role to government about the resilience of those communities and so whether it's in relation to some of the work in relation to bushfire risk that's already been mentioned uh the significant work that we need to do uh in terms of flood and storm risk ongoing but also some of those other things in relation to the challenges of critical infrastructure um the the ongoing threat of cyber security and some of those daily basis that have really been borne out by some of the issues we've dealt with through the pandemic um we've caused us to reflect and continue to improve and our job is to continue to now through that strategy one of our key elements is supporting local capability so very much um with the establishment of resilience new south wales we have for the first time our local coordination and service delivery team in many parts of regional new south wales as well as the sydney basin who can provide support to local government in emergency management planning impact assessment and recovery services and work alongside our response partners the uniformed agencies in in the helping affected communities so we're drawing together this unified resilience and I think I've been very fortunate to personally see that through some of the work that has been done as part of the covert response and some of the lessons we're learning from that we continue to grow with and and I'm I'm very confident we'll see continue to expand in new south wales our statewide confidence in resilience with a clear focus on planning and coordination and partnership efforts particularly with our commonwealth colleagues the um our intent is to continue to work towards the development of a state resilience strategy and more of that will be shared early in the new year as we start to commence the more detailed discussions about what we think that looks like in terms of providing how do we support our local communities how do we provide assurance to government and how do we continue to partner across all of our sectors and so the lessons we're learning um the success we're delivering against at this stage continue to help grow that so one of the key things the government has expects of us is that we do continue that coordinated approach and we're acting in a joined up way not only just across government but as we saw during the recovery efforts uh the work with um the corporate sector for example with lango rook and the other local subcontractors for the cleanup of those 3 600 properties has learned has has made on those processes when it comes to our accommodation pods the work that we've done with the mindaroo foundation as well as the salvation army and the australian red cross to get those pods out and available those 210 pods uh to help people the continued work we do in partnership with our foreign emergency services but also more than ever with the australian defense force who became a key partner again during the covert uh response operations and the work we win to do with all planning and development areas in relation to our efforts uh to continue to improve our planning and development controls across the state and the work that we can do to support that we have a remit to develop that integrated view of the statewide risk and vulnerability and we continue to work with identifying the resilience priorities across the state to do that so over the coming year you will see additional investment into risk reduction grants programs and please keep an eye out for that you will see the expansion of the disaster preparedness programs across our regional areas and you um our approach to enhancing capacity by additional training and online support to people not only in the foreign emergency services sector but across our local government and other community partners we continue to work very closely uh um with the charity and not-for-profit sector uh and the wonderful work that's been done with some of the food charities as well as our traditional partners such as the australian red cross and the salvation army in engli care and some vincent de paul and many others we want to continue to grow because it sits very alongside the heart of resilience in relation to the work we can do as an empowered community um so we're continuing to work through what's been a very challenging time but very proud of the fact that we are on the re um on the rebound many ways as a state and as I said by taking the community at the heart approach which we did through the covert the covet example and what we've done through the recovery efforts we certainly intend to make sure that we are able I think I better leave it for there because kim very keen to have an ongoing discussion with questions people have about the role of resilience new south wales and the way forward from here thank you thank you so much dominic we really appreciate it um so if anybody has any questions in regards to resilience new south wales and what they're doing in this space and how everything is interacted into line together to help support you please pop them in the q a or in the chat there is one in there at the moment donnie I'll just open this up for you uh so we've been asked how is funding being provided for resilient community projects and what is the process and selection criteria I'll just make sure I'm off mute there are a number of different programs we are working on in relation to that the most significant and I mean there's there's been some work underway already in relation to um uh the recent flood events and so there'll be some more work um for those most significant one is that one I mentioned towards the end in relation to the uh our partnership with the commonwealth in terms of the national risk reduction strategy and that will be the best way that people can access money there will be statewide programs but there will also be significant funding available for community programs through that and what we're looking for is key key programs that go towards risk analysis risk understanding how we can share information in relation to it and and and obviously also positive programs that may indeed reduce say bushfire risk storm risk and the like within communities fantastic thank you dominique what we're going to do now so if people want to pop any more questions in there uh just to support dominic as in the delivery that he's just provided we're going to get corrine to show you a little bit more about the cro program and how that works and how that supports our community so if anybody else has further questions if they can pop them in the chat or the q a and we demonstration karine just we've got nice sound from your end sorry we're on mute now so just um talking about the community recovery officer program and what it is um so new south wales community recovery officers were positioned across 22 fire affected lgas in new south wales to support communities throughout recovery so dominic just um touched on this just early on the windshield caribbea and wallendale cro program are managed by council funded by resilience new south wales and they're responsible for the development of a range of recovery initiatives alongside community groups and stakeholders so we have a few key deliverables here under the cro program and that ensures that community recovery needs are understood that individuals have access to important information that there is community input into important recovery plans and documents which shape recovery activities in your local area and it also supports a statewide program framework across new south wales while being adaptable to local approaches to recovery and so you'll notice that in these in each lgas I'll have site specific needs of each community so wall and our community is very um different in terms of the people on the ground the infrastructure they may or may not be available in those communities and what is represented there so uh the cro uh facilitated some community recovery workshops in 2020 for both the southern and northern villages of the windy caribbean uh the purpose of these workshops were for residents actually to collectively identify the immediate recovery needs for their community so uh what we do plan like what we do and continue to do is um keep these workshops going and keep our online communications open with communities we work very closely with them on the ground um throughout our roles and some of the key themes that were identified for our southern and northern villages specifically they asked for community connection they were talking about community resilience mental health and well-being support um preparedness and hazard reduction firefighting infrastructure telecommunications and support for rebuilding housing support natural environment economic recovery and insurance and financial aid now council won't be the lead agency in most of these but it was really important to collate what so we were then able to give that information back to community who are the lead agencies what council is responsible for um we do have a response document from council that shows um what we are doing in this space and what we continue to do and that is available on our community bushfire web page for those that you would like to go through that's quite an extensive document and I'm working through that today so also with community recovery we do have a lot of programs and events um so using those themes that are continually identified by community council delivers a range of programs to assist in recovery council has been committed to prioritizing infrastructure projects economic schemes and have helped us fire impacted communities councils implemented many environmental interviews to help our landscape recovery in a range of social connection events and activities to bring our communities even closer together so council's community recovery team has delivered a range of recovery events and programs and these have been funded through the cro program and other grant funding opportunities so some of them residents to connect back to nature driving movies in the community recovery concert which is probably one of the largest events windy caribbean seen in many years um it was really great uh to be out on the ground there too because we had a whole of community we understand that the northern southern villages yes were indeed impacted but also there was a of needed post cover 19 of a lot of reconnection within across the shire so coming together and sort of celebrating the good times and recreating memories was key for that it was really good to see some of the um the feedback from that was we actually created a space unintentionally for those bushfire impacted residents to tell their stories and share those stories so those that weren't significantly impacted and just bring that community cohesion and our support through that we also did regrow windy caribbean so you can see some public school students there on the screen a school planting project so we went out to a number of fire impacted schools earlier this year and um planted repotted over 2 000 schools now are looking after them in their schools so that they're developing programs about um environmental needs and responding to that in their communities so we'll host a number of events beginning of next year where the students will get to distribute that out to their communities so it's just that sense of belonging in there as well for them we held some writing for wellbeing uh workshops photovoice we've got a renewal our resilience book launch and stories to heal us so just a few um health and well-being programs there to the community um council also um did a bushfire community recovery small grants program so touching on the question that we had up before um I'd notice that you did mention about where can we get grants from many different places and where can you get funding from many different places it is a um you do have to keep an eye out for them we're largely across what's available so you can always reach out to council we can assist if there's any community related ones for for we will communicate that out um but in this particular case we just used some statewide funding to then re put that funds into community so some of the really exciting applications and community groups that applied to this was the men's table so windy caribbean resilience resilient communities of men um the garden of memories which is the one that you can see on the screen there down at bunsen moon they just wanted to get together as a community again and just replant some of the trees just to commemorate uh like some bushfires I gather connect reflection and healing through songs that's southern tablelands arts um some of the songs that the kids are doing now are through that are quite incredible yet to be released um balmoral basketball buddies um and just a couple of other ones there um stories towards recovery and fostering a strong resilience community so down at once and again there uh immediately after the fires council established the windy caribbean social recovery subcommittee so this is still running two years on we meet monthly there's 25 active federal government agencies which is exciting as well as community groups and community representations from bushfire impacted villages the agencies represented locally there are also anglicare the red cross department of education salvation army's vincent for rural financial counselling and habitat for humanity um so it's real it's a really great group that we get together we sort of pinpoint what's happening out there in community and um work with our residents and feedback into that into that committee there and we can work out what the needs are identify any gaps and move forward and recovery through that so when we do go out to community community did tell us that they would like a clear plan for recovery that is community owned and councils also heard a desire to have more opportunity for community import so working groups told us that we're people in community who are ready to contribute council heard an interest in developing mentors who can help their communities in preparing and recovering from future disasters so what we are doing now is we are seeking to establish a community and this group will be involved in a two-way information exchange between council community about information management disaster preparedness and recovery um if you would like to be a part of that please head over to council's website it's going to be very exciting 2022. we're also looking at ways to supporting community development their own recovery and resilience plans so projects in the windy caribbean council working on projects that foster disaster mentors harnessing the learnings from our community members and providing opportunities to peer support program so it's really exciting that even in the midst of recovery there are people in community who are ready to stand up and pass the button and use uh what they've learned throughout this experience to help and foster other mentors which is really great so there's also multiple projects have been recently announced under the recent bushfire community recovery and resilience fund so stream two that cover the windy caribbean so these are statewide projects that have tapped into our our communities which is really exciting there's plenty that are across wallander as well out in 2022. um so council will assist these projects to liaise with our communities projects begin to roll out and we're excited to be working in partnership with vega valley child council and our joint community business program of events there too so to find out more what's happening in this space um which caribbean and across voluntary you can head to the council's community resilience page there I'm just showing you a quick thing so we've had up the last six months of disaster dashboard this is a really good one-stop shop for everything that's happening in terms of any incidents like over 19 fire instances road conditions it really is a plethora of information there natalie touched on it yesterday um in good detail so I won't go too much into that um so just here here's a list of contacts we'll have this up on the screen so uh council has always had a bushfire recovery hotline so dial in there we've got community um a customer service officers there that are that are trained in you and getting you that right information and of course you can always reach out to me directly um my contact details over there and on the website uh if you are in the midst of recovery still which we understand most are bushfire community recovery we've got a web page there on our website and then also moving into community resilience as well because we do realize there are parts of the show that are recovering but there are parts of the show as well that are ready ready for preparedness and community resilience program so that will happen soon so it's a little bit about what we're doing here thank you for your time and um I'll pass back a bit again thanks kim fantastic thanks so much corrine so um we've got a couple of questions so I'm probably based at yourself dominic so I'll read these out to you so the first one um does resilience new south wales have a list of risk by lgas across by type and classification for example bushfire landslide informational data seasonal exposures planning preparing and managing their risks no no thanks very much kim for the question I think hopefully I'm not talking over the top of you my video has got a bit of a delay um look in terms of risk um analysis at a state level most of our work at this stage has been hazard based in relation to understanding you know what what do we face as a state some of those things I put up before in relation to whether it's bush fires floods cyber security counterterrorism threats other natural hazards the pandemic itself etc etc there is more work to be done at the local level in relation to unpacking that depending on the risk um as you may or may not be aware through the new south wales rural fire service significant work has been done in relation to mapping bushfire risk and better for the purposes of planning fire trail works hazard reduction priorities and of course ongoing response efforts however it's fair to say that that's not as a comprehensive across other hazards so we are very keen as department of planning regional new south wales and others in relation to things like improved uh improved local uh understanding in relation things like flood risk uh and other risks sometimes quite uh unique but but a bit obvious in some areas when you look at somewhere like the illawarra in relation to things like landslip uh to better do that and that's very much why and just following on from korean's discussion there about how when that money starts to go out the door and we notify people we are very keen under the um under our risk reduction framework to get a more localized understanding of risk and then help use that to help fund our investment priorities and improve across the state fantastic thanks dominic another question we've got he which came in from community what does resilience new south wales have in place to support the community with the current recovery support service due to finish at the end of december this year considering that research shows recovery can take up to 10 years now again another really good question and something to work with the options around that and of course uh we've already been out as I mentioned before been already been able to extend some services we do know um and and any very the the question is very qui uh correct in relation to the long-term impact but again it also goes back to some of the work we are doing within resilience new south wales the fact that we've now been able to stand up an agency of permanent staff that do have responsibilities in terms of local coordination and service delivery across new south wales means that will we have a much more latent capacity uh to support our communities for the next decade the government and certainly commissioner fitzsimmons doesn't want to be in a position where we have to keep going back year after year to fund grant monies to support some of these programs so there will always be needed for specific recovery support services in mental health or specific needs in relation to accommodation or business recovery and the like but through the new um the new way forward away from that traditional model of you wait till you have a disaster then you work out where you get some funding from and then you start to fund the funding funding report services for for a year or two and then walk away again the whole model of resilience new south wales means that we intend to very much make sure that those focus on priority is is over the longer term of of course depending on the scale of the disaster there will always be a need to expand those services as we're currently doing and as we saw with the mid north coast floods uh to meet those needs but we want to become a more have a more sustainable model for that going forward and the recruitment of our new uh staff into the agency is still only just finalizing we we we've done most of the recruitment round and most of the people are now in place but of course now now their role is to get out and about and um and work alongside our other community partners in recovery support functions has any further questions what we might do is we might take those on on notice and we can always email them through to dominic at resilience and get some further clarification on that everything will be available on both the council website so just want to thank dominic very much for his time today um very much appreciate you stepping in at the last minute so thank you so much dominic well thanks thanks very much kim again and thanks very much to all the conference organizers and um I wish you well with the rest of your day and hopefully um really looking forward to hearing our reports back in terms of the feedback and where we can continue to support our local communities particularly those that have been so significantly impacted over the last couple of years thanks once again thank you wonderful thank you okay so we'll just move on now we um we have a presentation just to show before our next guest speaker so um so this presentation is being has been provided by rrt which are called rapid relief team so some not so rapid relief team delivers hope and relief to people across the globe whether it be fire flood or humanitarian need they have expanded their support services to meet the needs of the that is required at the time of the disaster so they support in emergency and disaster relief youth health and disability and homelessness we do have a current video that we are going to show at the moment and this is around their fire relief so what they have implemented is a rapid water system so I will share that video with you now we've been engaged with helping the rural fire services over a number of years and what we've noticed with the drought the water is drying up so coupled with fighting the fires they're running out of water so we put together our team a team of volunteers from rrt and we've designed and engineered a rapid water system it's a mobile plant that we can deploy very quickly within two hours of finding inaccessible water source we can move in to bring that inaccessible water close to water refill quickly so they can get back out in the front line and protect the assets houses and what have you the situation here today is we've got a fire behind us coming through the hills the fire is less than five kilometers away we've got rfs tankers protecting houses there's a serious lack of water to refill their trucks the water source that we've come across here is inaccessible and so we've pumped out of that we've drafted out of that blue lagoon and we've pumped it nearly two kilometers here to this tank which is 75 000 liters we filled in 12 minutes we can actually probably even get that down to 10 minutes we're still trialing the equipment we can fill four trucks at the time here plus a bulk water tanker uh obviously we're on a wastewater so we're um we've actually filled the farmer's dam here who is drought stricken cattle so we've got our overflow anything we spill goes straight back into his dam so this system has been engineered 000 liter storage tank behind us here and then from this 70 000 liter tank we can fill into these water carts at 150 liters per second so we can fill these small mobile fire fighting equipment we can fill them in just over a minute fully automatic system which I can start from a fob in my hand the pumps are positioned nearly two kilometers away so we can move water fast we can get water from difficult locations right up close to where the firefighters need it and we can bring the trucks into this location easily where they can top up fast they don't have to go through difficult terrain to access the water they can pull in here load fast and be back on the fire front in a few moments makes a big difference especially out here central west uh water's a bit scarce at the moment so lucky to find a water supply here if there's no reticulated water in the area they're having this kind of system where they drag water from some distance away yeah we appreciate the tank after tank throughout the whole day so tens of thousands of liters really uh generally about five to six minutes to fill uh here you'll probably get that back down about two and a half you know it's a great help we see the rapid water system is something that's scalable I would like to think we could set this up and have it in strategic locations throughout new south wales queensland and victoria so that these rapid water system can be deployed quickly when there's an emergency and lack of water to fight the fire thank you for sharing that video kim um rapid relief team are a fairly new organization or maybe not um super neutral and tilly but not very well known yet and certainly um making more a presence here all the time but we have a very active rapid relief team ebola delhi who provided some amazing support through us for the area since the fires so they've supported some of our community events and our memorial events that we've done since the fires and borough grand valley in your andre after the flood event early this year they provided food here but for us to airlift out um so it was a great partnership with the scs the rfs and the rapid relief team to provide support to those residents who were stranded for a couple of weeks in the varroa grand valley um they've also been providing food here us through some of our community organizations like uh warriganda silverdale neighbourhood centre and community links well being providing food campus to those who have been um impacted by the kobe 19 lockdown and pandemic so a huge thanks to the rapid relief team and their ongoing presence they've got a presence in southern highlands well in dilly and across the macarthur so it's a group I think that we'll be seeing a lot more of and who play a really valuable role in this resilience space and um the response phase to when an emergency does happen I also just want to quickly share so there's a question before around um some some of the ways people can might their area where they live might be prone to just want to quickly share the get ready well and dilly website as well so this is um a website that was put together with some funding from cro and in partnership with the korean guy council um sorry so just going to quickly share this it's called climate wise communities funding that allowed us to develop this website but it's a really great tool that residents of all jelly can jump on to help them get better prepared for the different types of disaster that their area might be prone to so it also talks about some of the different workshops that might be up and coming as well we're hoping to run more workshops next year once we are fully out of lockdown and we can run events unrestricted again but this is a really great tool that I don't think is super well known across the community that people can use to look at what types of disasters they might be prone to in their area of wall and dilly thank you ladies if this is something you and corrine can answer or whether it's something we've got to take back to dominic there is a question in the q a um so is it true that resilience new south wales are paying for rebuilds of residents who have no insurance someone has been made aware of a family who would appear to be this would be happening for other residents are distressed out of other residents who are in the same place access this service is this something that you could be able to answer is this something we would have to take back to dominic I'm not sure about that one yeah look I don't know um we have to have a look into that one and just get a more structured answer from brazilians new south wales I don't know where we stand and discuss about that but I'm definitely looking into it for you um if you'd like to provide us your contact details we can provide that answer to you um personally if you'd like so that would be great messages that'd be great and so what we'll do if uh if there's anybody who's um you know wants to get in contact with either natalie corrine or myself we'll put our individual details in the chat so if you don't feel that you want to put your details in the chat that's fine you can actually then come through one of us and we can look into that for you that's no problem at all so moving along now I'd like to uh welcome alexandra so alexandra is from legal aid and alex will be talking to you today around a few different uh aspects in particular identifying common legal issues that arise after a disaster including insurance tenancy financial hardships grants and financial support employment neighbor issues discussing when legal issues may arise after a disaster and how a lawyer can help how to access legal help both immediately and in the long term recovery alex is the senior solicitor with for disaster response legal services with legal aid new south wales alex has over six years experience working and providing legal advice and case work assistance to persons affected by natural disasters she specializes in insurance consumer and financial hardship legal issues welcome alex thanks very much kim I'm just going to share my screen now please let me know if that is coming up yes all good alex perfect great um well we'll kick off thanks very much for that introduction kim I just like to also acknowledge that I'm presenting today from gadigal land and I pay my respects to elders past present and emerging and also extend that respect to any aboriginal or torres strait islander persons listening today so as kim said I'm a solicitor at legal aid new south wales I worked in the disaster response legal service that sits within legal aid new south wales and our service specialises in giving legal advice to people who have experienced a disaster as kim said I've worked in this space for a couple of years now providing advice for people that have experienced a disaster all over the state so that includes you know most recently floods up on also certainly we did a lot of work after the 2019-2020 bushfires and continued to to assist people with legal issues um after the after the fires uh to this day so this morning I really just wanted to discuss two kind of key issues the first being what types of legal issues actually come out of a disaster and so we'll be discussing in a little bit more detail things like insurance law tenancy law and financial hardship um and then I also wanted to hopefully you know explain a bit about how a lawyer can actually assist with these issues and how to access legal help if if you need it after a disaster um and you know I'll probably be speaking about 20 minutes this morning and hopefully we'll have some time for some questions if anyone has any afterwards so just a little bit about what the disaster response legal service is so as I said the disaster response legal service sits within legal aid new south wales and we specialize in giving legal advice to people who are affected by disasters that any other extreme weather event we are a free service which means that anyone who's experiencing legal issues that's been affected by a disaster can contact us for free legal advice we also partner with the legal assistance sector to provide these services so that includes organizations like local community legal centers who are the locals on the ground we also partner with pro bono partners like justice connect and the law society of new south wales and the goal with this is that together with these organizations we aim to help as many people as possible with as many issues as possible so sometimes there's areas of law that we don't specialize in or we don't have the expertise in but that's okay that's why we partner with these organizations so that if somebody comes through to us with the legal issue that we're not able to to assist with fully we always try to use those connections to refer them to the right place that they can get that legal advice that they need and we also try to help a disaster that throws a range of issues at people and that makes you know sometimes navigating what would otherwise be a pretty simple task for people really difficult so we just try to bring that understanding to our work and and help people in the way that best suits their needs at that time how so how do we actually provide that this legal help so first and foremost what we do is give legal advice and in some instances ongoing legal representation to people who have a legal issue after a disaster initially we provide that advice at disaster recovery centres when they're established so we're sitting in there with other agencies um and can provide that legal advice face-to-face with people in in that sort of immediate sense after a disaster um and we also you know go on outreach to communities that have been affected when there's um you know community expos and other opportunities for us to meet with people face to face and give advice we also have our helpline which is operational still to this day monday to friday 9 number it gets triaged and then your call will get transferred to legal aid new south wales and you'll be put in contact with a lawyer like myself and my colleagues to be able to give people sort of direct legal advice about the issues they're facing so as I said that line is still operational now and available for anyone to call through to if they're if they want to access legal help um that way through the phone and another big part of the work that we do is what we call community legal education so we go to community meetings do a legal education talks like the one I'm doing this morning podcasts and other other events to provide information to community and community workers about these legal issues that they might be experiencing um and we also have a lot of publications um and and fact sheets designed for people to be able to you know read those resources and and self-help or get some more information about their situation if they if they so choose so all those resources are available on the screen now um okay so talked about what the disaster response legal service is um and now I just wanted to talk a bit more about some of the legal issues that you might experience after a disaster and how a lawyer can actually help with those so I know that when we're talking about the recovery journey lawyers and legal help that's probably not the first thing that springs to mind for most people and that's understandable but we know that there's a lot of issues that people encounter when they're on that recovery journey and often many of those issues are actually legal issues where people have rights um around those points and you know that's not always immediately apparent to people that this is actually a legal issue that they're experiencing and that they can actually get some legal advice about that so I guess the goal of today's talk is to just flag some of these issues that might actually be legal issues and hopefully sort of jogging people's minds that that's something that in contact with us so uh these issues are also you know hopefully quite generally nature that they're issues that people experience you know not just for fires but also in floods or storm events and depending on you know where you are in your recovery process some of these issues might not be as apparent now um but certainly for for future future disasters if they occur this is also really good information to keep in mind about you know the help that might be out there if you need to access it um so the first legal issue that I wanted to chat about today is insurance I would say insurance is by far the by far and large the biggest legal issue that we advise people on after a disaster and we can really give advice to people throughout that whole claims process journey and issues that they might encounter with their insurance so you know firstly at the very immediate stages it might be that people just need help accessing their key insurance documents you know them that's not usually something that you you or your home's been destroyed or damaged so we can you know direct them and help them gain access to those documents equally sometimes people don't know who their insurance is with and we can also direct them to help them find who their insurance policy is with at that initial stage after we have access to those documents we can help people understand what they're actually covered for under their policy and that's not just what weather events they're covered for so whether they're covered for a fire or a flight or not but also and probably most importantly it's also helping people understand what additional benefits they might actually be entitled to under their policy so that's things like temporary accommodation coverage debris removal coverage food spoilage and emergency payments um often some of these benefits depending on which policy you have that their benefits that are paid in addition to their some insured which means they're actually amounts on top of their some insured that they'd be a that they may be able to claim so it covered for under that policy um and then helping them also you know sometimes get in contact with the insurer and make claims for those benefits um if they haven't already done so we can also give people advice on the time frames that insurers you know have to adhere to in the claims process and also their obligations to communicate with people and the time frames that they're obliged to do that and that can sometimes just give people a bit more understanding about what to expect for that claims process in terms of time frames and communication with their insurer we can also talk to people about their options um if they're at the stage of settling their claim and talk to them about the difference between you know cash settlements um and the insurer managing repairs or rebuilds so when people are making those decisions they are big decisions to make and getting advice about what their options might be in that circumstance and really understanding those options and being able to weigh them up can be of real assistance equally it may be settlement it is that they've received so in some circumstances people know they've made a claim they've got a sum of money in their bank account but they don't really actually understand what that was for and what that covered we can help um you know get them that information and and go through that with them so they can really understand um you know what that settlement was that they reach with the insurer um we also know you know as as has been said this morning in and throughout the conference that the recovery journey is long and people you know some people are very much still in the process of rebuilding now even two years on for people that are having their rebuild managed by their insurer we can also give advice to them about what to do if things are going wrong in that rebuild process so actually under the general insurance code of practice if an insurer is managing that rebuild or repairs they actually have to guarantee the the quality of that work so that means that you know you wrong um and and there is onus on insurers to to do something about that so again we can talk to people about what their rights are here and and help them you know in those discussions with their insurer if they need to raise those issues um and finally we can also give people advice and this is a big one about the disputes and appeals process with insurance companies so often people think if they've made a claim and it's been refused or even refused in part that that's the end of the story and there's not much that they can do about that every policy has the right to have a decision from the insurer reviewed so that means that you know if if you think that decision was incorrect or unfair in some way you do have the right to ask the insurer insurer to review that decision and then also if if you're still unhappy with that response you do have the right to have that decision appealed to the ombudsman service known as afgha so we can certainly give an appeal but also go through their situation with them and and help them understand about whether that that's a worthwhile process that you know that they might want to go through in their circumstances and obviously in some cases too we can represent people through that process um where required and we can yeah even where in situations where people have settled their matter and they think that there's not much further that can be done in some circumstances you are able to go back to the insurer and ask them to review certain parts of the decision depending on you know the time frames and where you're at to in that claims journey so we hope that the take home message from this little spiel about insurance is that no matter where you are on that claims process if if something feels unfair or you weren't sure about something or you just wanted some further information or advice about your insurance claim it costs nothing to give us a call and we can chat through what your options might be with you and give really big legal issue that arises after disasters is housing or tenancy law so tenancy issues come up for people who are in rental accommodation that might have been damaged or destroyed in a disaster um and that's likely to throw up a range of legal issues for people it may be that those people have questions about do they still need to pay their rent during a period where their property's either been destroyed or or damaged um equally it might be people having questions about how to get repairs done to their property and how to approach their landlord about that if if the property's been damaged by a disaster and also people may have questions about you know ending their lease early if if the if the property's been destroyed or damaged and what are their rights and obligations in that situation so we can give people advice about what the tenancy law says in their specific situation and also advice and assistance with any dispute process that they might have to go through after a disaster financial hardship is another issue um is something that we see not just in the immediate sense after a disaster but also very much in that longer term recovery financial hardship puts in please just is where someone's having difficulty meeting their everyday expenses like their mortgage payments or you know credit card payments car loans or any other debt that they have if they're having trouble meeting those expenses and you've experienced a disaster you actually do have uh legal rights in that situation um and you know so often people I guess aren't quite aware of what their rights are in that situation and think that you know money stress isn't necessarily a problem a legal issue or something that they can get assistance with but to the contrary especially where people have experienced a disaster and you know that's a contributing factor to their financial stress um you actually have the right under the credit law to to ask your bank or your creditor um for financial hardship assistance after you've experienced a disaster and again I'd reiterate that's not just in the immediate after they've experienced a disaster if you're in financial hardship you could you can also seek this assistance so you can ask for help in in a number of ways it could be you know a reduction in the amount of payments you have to make for a period of time it could be a stop in in payments for a period of time just to allow you to get back on your feet um equally for some debts it might be a reduction in the amount of debt owed and in some circumstances it could be a waiver of that debt depending on the size and the nature of what that debt is so um that you can ask for this assistance from a lender and they're actually legally obligated to to properly consider that request um and if they refuse that request you also have rights to to have that decision reviewed at the ombudsman service known as africa as well it's not just banks that have these policies in place many utility companies also have financial hardship policies as well as you know know if people have fines that they're having struggle paying there are options for dealing with with those fines debts as well either repayment plans or in some circumstances work and development orders might be available which are schemes to help you either participate in programs or work off fines that might be available to people as well we work very closely with financial counselors who are wonderful people who are really experts in all things financial hardship they are both you know available across australia but certainly across new south wales we also have a financial counselor dedicated in our team at the moment working with disaster affected people and so if you are experiencing financial hardship issues we very much encourage you to either get in contact with a financial counselor or get in contact with us too and we can talk to you about what your what your rights are in that situation and also you know help you talk to creditors as well to figure out what might be a good solution in your circumstances so the take home message with financial hardship isn't options available to you and yeah it's very worthwhile engaging with a financial counselor to to help you work out what those options might be uh another issue that really pops up certainly sort of in that immediate aftermath of a disaster is employment related issues so people might have questions about you know what what happens if you stood down by an employer and whether that's lawful in in those circumstances equally people might need to take time off work to to care for a family member or friend or in some cases to volunteer for certain agencies like the rfs or the ses we can talk to people about what their leave entitlements are during that period after a disaster so that they're informed and can make the correct decisions in relation to their employment so they're just some of the legal issues we can help with there are many others that pop up another one that's you know very present uh after disasters and in the and in the longer term recovery is issues about payments so that can be both centrelink those payments and equally we know that there are a lot of government grants that become available and again we can help people understand the eligibility requirements of some of those grants and give them some further advice about their eligibility and help direct them to the right places if that's a an issue that they're experiencing we can also give advice on you know issues with neighbours a really common one that pops up especially after fires is fences whose obligation is it to fix the fence and and how do you go about you know getting a fence fixed if you're having a disagreement with your neighbor about it we can give people advice about you know what what the law says in those situations um equally replacing important documents after a disaster I know it's a really practical one but um you know it's something that obviously needs to be addressed and many government departments now have processes in place to help people replace those documents either you know at a very low cost or for free and we can help people having trouble accessing those those schemes and really sort of any other everyday legal problem that might pop up after a disaster as I've said before if it's not something that we have the expertise to deal with uh directly we always try to refer you to the most appropriate place so that you can get that legal advice that that you need after a disaster um and so very much on that point um we also have the bushfire legal aid grant scheme which is still available and probably quite relevant for for your community um so that this scheme is for primary producers and small businesses who have legal issues resulting from the 2019-2020 bushfires you can apply to this scheme and that allows you to get a grant of money so a pot of money to pay a private lawyer to represent you in those matters so they could be legal issues like fencing matters again it could be property issues like easements over property retail leases contracts disputes or business and farm insurance disputes that this scheme is available still for people with those want more information about the eligibility requirements or applying for that scheme to get a private lawyer to to represent you in those matters um please do get in contact with us with the number on the screen and we can talk to you a bit further about those requirements and and applying for that scheme so look in summary the best way to get in contact with us if if you have a legal question or you wanted to talk about your matter even if you're not quite sure whether it is a legal issue just get in contact with us anyway the best way is our hotline so that's 1-800-801-529 as I've also said we we have our website there on the screen which has a lot of fact sheets and you know further information about legal issues that you might be experiencing after a disaster so please do access that if if you'd like and yeah hopefully today I've given you a slight insight into what are some of the legal issues that might pop up after you've experienced a disaster this recovery process is long we just want to reiterate that we're still here we're still available to give legal advice about any issues that you might be experiencing and I guess the take-home message is it doesn't cost anything to get in contact even just to check um and you know at the very least hopefully we can just give you some information about your situation um and and you know it could lead to something more so if any questions at all please do get in contact with us and we're here and available and I'm willing to help thanks very much kim I'll throw back to you thank you so much alex that was a really great presentation some really helpful and useful information for for residents um we'll open the floor now to questions if anybody has any questions for alex otherwise we do have some um that we have that we've been provided with to ask today as well also we'll have alex's um fact sheets up on the web page as well like for it will be easily to access sure and look if anything pops up after the presentation I'm more than happy to if people could send their questions through to kim or to natalie corrin and forward them to me more than happy to to answer those later on if if they come up so one question I did have for you alex was that a number of residents across wall and delhi and winter caribbe have unfortunately had experience with fraudulent tradesmen following the period of the fires um so we had one we've had a number of residents who've had to go through mediation processes or other processes to try and reclaim money that was paid for work that wasn't delivered for a person experiencing a fraud situation or who suspects that they might be unfortunately being a victim of a broad situation how could legal aid support them through that process yeah certainly and I mean it's so disappointing to hear that those situations are arising but unfortunately we we know that they do so certainly again as a first port of call us through through that hotline we can help explore with them you know what what their current entitlements are it may be that you know that there are issues with the way in which their insurance payout was made we could talk to them about that but then certainly you know if there's issues with the quality of the work that's been done we can talk to them about about their rights there and perhaps refer them to a private that might be able to take action um against you know a building company if required but equally if it's a situation of fraud um you know again we can talk to them about what their possible entitlements might be there um you know referring them to the appropriate bodies which in some cases might be you know referring them to the police to make those appropriate reports um and then you know looking at their situation as a whole to see whether there are any other rights that they might be able to um to to exercise in relation to other bodies so it's really protocol we'd really encourage them to get in contact with us and then we can work with them to find you know what what might be the appropriate and best referrals we can make for them um to get for further legal advice if there are sort of other actions that they might be able to follow through on another question that has come up several times it relates a little bit to what you're talking about with fences earlier as well and disputes around fences and replacement offences is around trees and trees on neighbouring properties that people might feel are a threat to to replace fencing or rebuild buildings after fires is that another matter that people can seek advice from legally about yeah certainly so um tree issues equally we know that they they pop up a lot as well and we can certainly give them that general information about what the law says in their situation um and you know talk to them about what um what are the appropriate dispute processes that they can go through um with their neighbor if it's taking those next steps so we can certainly give them advice about what the law says in their specific situation thank you so much alex that's great um some lovely feedback in the chat from kerry about the presentation um well thank you so much alex if we get any further questions we will definitely be in touch and thank you for providing your information I think that's invaluable so not only for our residents who've been impacted by the fires and the floods we've had but also our recent storm event so if anyone who's listening today was impacted by our recent storm with ben infillment is looking for some assistance as well legally it could be a really great contact for that situation absolutely yeah we very much want to reiterate it's not just firefocus it's any disaster issues that you might be experiencing so yeah please do get in contact if you have any any issues at all we'd love to hear from people that's great thanks alex thank you okay I'll now like to welcome liam council of australia in october 2020 providing operational support for catastrophe response and was appointed senior advisor mitigation and catastrophe management in august 2021 liam has over 18 years in insurance claims management and insurance catastrophe response experience and leadership dating back to tropical cyclone larry in 2006 liam brings an interesting perspective to insurance catastrophe response having been personally impacted by the brisbane flood in 2011. I'd like to welcome liam next speaker thank you g'day_''_6858.159 can you see me and hear me yes we can yep excellent terrific just let me uh share my screen everyone got that well not yet yep we can see that now thank you liam excellent um g'day_''_6888.0 everyone thanks so much for um joining everyone today um just a couple of things um first off um a really excellent presentation from um alexandra there from from legal aid legal aid provides such a critical service to community especially um you know on the back of events and certainly um you know all of the information that alexandra provided in relation uh to insurances is bang on the money and aid does or we certainly support what legal aid does um you know for communities also and I'm very mindful um you know that the timing of this event um in fact you know falls right at a time when you know your community has been quite significantly impacted by some very severe weather and I've had the pleasure of of dealing with a number of folks from the wallanderi shire council and it really has been a pleasure and it's you know really terrific to see folks that are you know so dedicated to helping uh helping out their community um my presentation today is um I i pivoted um a little bit um given the the recent um severe event and I imagine there's quite a few um quite a few questions um in amongst the community and and uncertainty so I'd like to dedicate um as much time you know as I can to to fielding you know those questions and providing answers um as far as I'm able but some of the content um I think is still really important just want to give a brief um overview on you know what what the insurance council is I want to talk about the events of the of the last couple of years and and you know put some numbers um around um the cost and impact of of those events um I'll talk a little bit about risk and insurance in the context of resilience or a concept of resilience that I'd like to to talk with you about and and then sort of you know pivot a little bit more into some information you know relevant to where many of you are at at the moment um having uh you know experience some pretty significant um losses uh I'll talk through the claim process I'll talk through some issues unfortunately that that are playing out related to covert 19 and then happy then to really get get down into the detail of things and and understand how things are going and and and how you're moving forward through from the severe weather recently so the insurance council is the representative body for the general insurers um that you'll be dealing with at the moment or the the vast majority of those insurers are members of the insurance council and we represent them on a range of fronts one is you know at events such as this we provide operational support and coordination during significant weather events as well and we believe it's an insurable australia is a resilient australia and it's our purpose to be the voice for a resilient australia this purpose articulated in this way has really been solidified in the last sort of 12 to 24 months and a significant portion of the advocacy um which is you know really important function of the ica is focused um around um resilience related initiatives um mitigation related initiatives and climate change related initiatives um so I just wanted to I guess give everyone a sense of the scale of natural disasters you know nationally I know you've been you know you've been impacted locally but there's any number of communities that are that are impacted by um significant events at any given time and over the there's been more than 9 billion I know it says greater than 8.9 billion but it's it's greater than 9 billion dollars in damage covered by an insurance annually the cost of events is estimated around 18 billion dollars so that takes into account um all events that occur um and follow-on uh impacts not just the sort of direct property um damage impacts um that 18 billion dollars is expected to actually double um into the next decade and then in fact double again um you know beyond that um to 2050 but it's a huge drain um frankly on um the economy our society our communities um and this ties into the advocacy work that we do around resilience and and mitigation that this these sorts of losses nationally are sustainable um and that there's work that we can all do you know at the federal government level at the state government level at the local government level and as individuals um to you know uplift our resilience mitigate against um you know these events so that we don't have to deal now so I guess this was you know the crux of what you know I wanted to to talk to everyone about and and it's really important for you to know your risks sort of put that in italic there it's not just the risks it's really knowing your individual risks there's any number of hazards that you might be exposed to you know natural hazards of of course you know depending on where you live flooding may be uh bushfire cyclone um severe storms uh you know are a hazard um for anyone it's really important to to understand what you're exposed to in that regard near and far is also an important thing to think of and what I mean there is that you might be directly exposed to a flood risk for example but there could be hazards that aren't right on your doorstep that can create issues for you for example a fire risk that exists away from your property might create issues for you in terms of access to your property or if you're a business owner in delivery routes so it's important to not just think about those risks that are right on your doorstep but also to think about those risks and hazards that are you know maybe a little bit further away and oftentimes out of mind but can actually quite significantly you know impact you from a distance plan plan plan I'm a really firm believer that a form of resilience is is knowledge and planning and thinking about the risks and how you might deal with those risks to put you really in the best place to to protect what's important to you most so how will you protect the things that are most important to you first of all is you know getting informed being informed about what your risks are second is around having plans in the event the unfortunate event that one of those risks arises if you had to evacuate your property where would you stay what would you take with you what's the route that you would take the safest route um you know these these sorts of things and this is sort well is that insurance is a is a tool that's available to provide you know financial protection um in the event um of one of these risks um coming to pass another really important uh point and I can't really emphasize this one um enough is and I've and I've put it this way for a reason how much would it cost to start from scratch what I mean by that is if you think about all of your worldly possessions and I'm talking um you know sort of insurance here think of all of your worldly possessions and your home if your plot of land was just a vacant plot of land how much would it cost to put it back to where it was and I think this is a space where there is a risk of significantly underestimating those costs the cost to replace your home for example is not the valuation of the home it's the cost to in the event of a disaster potentially remove all of the debris remove the damaged elements of the buildings that might be to prepare the site it's the cost of course to to rebuild but it's also some additional costs um that don't automatically come to mind um for example building codes change over time so the the method of construction and style of home that you have right now might actually not be feasible to build back in exactly the same way because of changes to building codes also things like bushfire alert levels and other similar requirements there's similar requirements for flooding you know also should be taken uh into account or must be taken into account when considering the the cost of of rebuilding the other the other one which I mean arguably is more consistently underestimated is is actually the cost of replacing um all of your stuff um it's a real eye-opener and I've sort of put the challenge out if you've got um you know if you've got um some time over the weekend to go for a walk um through your house you know go into a bedroom go into your kitchen doesn't need to be go through every drawer every cupboard and put a value to everything that's that's in there uh you know of course all the furniture and appliances and and that sort of thing as well and I've done it myself um and it's quite mind-blowing when you start to think of every knife fork t-shirt shoe when you start putting values to all of these things it can really it can really add up and that's empowering because you know you can then make decisions around you know the the level of risk you know you're prepared to to take um there third point is so you understand what your your risks are now the hazards that you might be exposed to near and far you know you've got some plans in place you know how you want to protect things that are most important to you you know for those physical things the the costs to replace those things so if insurance falls into the into your plan then you strongly strongly recommend exploring the market the insurance council of australia has a you know with any um you know insurance brand at all it's it's really just a repository of insurers that provide covers for for certain you know different types of things um and if you felt you know the advice of an insurance broker um would be of benefit to you then visiting the national insurance brokers association website at neiba.com.ou they've also got a tool very easily accessible from the home page there where you can find a local broker that might be able to help you out with your insurance needs but to lift it back up to explore in the market there's other services out there as well there's compared to market and choosy and you know any number of different services out there where you can compare different products but the overarching theme there is to explore the market get some quotes you know read those policy disclosure or product disclosure documents rather to to make sure that that that coverage lines up with your knowledge of the hazards that you're exposed to and you know the level of cover a little bit of a a shift um into I guess some um information that you know might be of value to you right now given um your experience over the last several weeks um this is just a a sort of a generic overview of the claim process these steps largely apply um in in any claim the significance of each step you know will vary depending on you know depending on your specific claim situation but generally once you've you know lodged your claim whether that be on the phone or online if you have um building damage um that that is unsafe or is exposing uh you know your home to to the elements your insurer will look to arrange and make safe and and generally that will and should uh be arranged with quite a level of urgency these are generally temporary um type um repairs if you like uh that the intention is simply to to make safe um block from the elements until such a time that uh um you know an assessment can be completed and repairs um you know can start's in the in the lingo if you like make safe this would also include if there's any concerns with um electricity uh whether that be you know exposed exposed wiring or damaged electrical component tree including solar panels these these things would be made or should be made safe at that time the next step is um assessing the damage so this uh could be really one of three um people that might come out to do that it could be an insurance assessor that's directly employed by the insurance by your insurance company many insurers have partnership agreements with third-party um insurance assessors and and one of the reasons that they they do that is so is that they can scale up um their response um as needed so they can you know use those third parties to increase the number of assessors that they have in the field uh at any given point in time and it could also be it could also be a builder depending on the sense you know and the extent of the damage it could actually be a builder that's about is it's about understanding what happened in the first instance it's about surveying the the property and then the the actual damage and it's at this point often times where um specialists it becomes clear that some sort of specialist needs to be involved in the process so that could be you know an engineer if there's suspected structural damage for example uh it could be a an asbestos um clean up specialist um although you know that that could well be identified much earlier in the piece as well um during the make safe moving on from the assessment then the next stage is um the scope of work or statement of work um it's called sometimes that um that's the stage where the information that's been gathered through that make safe process through this through the assessment process and from from you through the claim lodgement and the conversations you know that you will have had with the assessor for example that's where all this information essentially sort of gets put together and a scope of work or uh and specific for for building work is is put together this should be provided to you ultimately in writing it's not uncommon um that that scope of work will need to be iterated through a number of times there's a couple of reasons for that the the assessors and builders don't always you know pick up the finer details um you know that are really obvious to you because it's your home so those those things can be missed from time to time so certainly um providing that feedback through and getting that scope of work updated and iterated through is is um is not an uncommon thing and absolutely is is what should be happening if there's um you know items that are missed from that scope of work once everything's um sort of in order in terms of the scope of work then the claim will sort of move into that repair repair stage but also um cash settlement stage and I um I just made a note there in um alexandra from from legal aid um her presentation there's or cash settlement is a really um is a really important stage of the of the claim and it's a really important a really important decision to make and I think you know the advice to seek advice if you you know if you feel you need it and certainly um you know for that independent view um you know is is really something uh you know to consider particularly in that decision around to have um you know the insurer manage the repair versus accepting um a cash settlement or requesting a cash settlement rather if if you're requesting a cash settlement it's important to understand that you know compliance with you know regulations and and building codes you know using of course using a licensed builder all of these things that the insurer would would manage where we're there managing the overall repair ultimately falls to you and and the builder that you would appoint you know to to do the job if the job isn't done properly or it's not done completely um then that can have implications or if at well uh that can have um implications in the insurability um of of your home or that building moving forward so it is a really um it is a really important um really important stage and something to really consider um deeply there there are some situations where um you know a cash settlement is the only um mode or or option for settlement and the sort of number one example there is um where um it's a total loss what we call a total loss so it's a sort of a very um harsh uh harsh term but uh essentially if the the building is completely destroyed or um or the sun insured um is um exceeded in terms of what a repair might cost uh or and the same applies for contents then it would be deemed a total loss and a cash settlement and I think the in those situations um the the advice that alexander also provided around um you know seeking some financial counselling is a really really um sensible piece of advice you know to consider if you find yourself in in final stage I guess if you like and isn't applicable to everyone is the um sort of feedback and complaints process so any decision that's made on a claim can be disputed so nothing in that first instance is is final um and um in the first instance let your insurer know that um you're not satisfied or you don't agree with that decision and that will trigger uh that that review process and then beyond that the australian financial complaints authority or afka as it is referred to is is the completely independent um review of a dispute if if it can't_''_8402.96 be resolved before it gets there um covert 19 so look this is a this is a tough one that there are some um there are some consequences of of the pandemic that are impacting um the insurance industry um at the moment um and this is um impacting the insurance industry it's impacting more than just the insurance industry but of course in the context of the insurance industry and these these are national issues they're not specific to they're impacting everyone nationally um the first is um global supply chains uh are impacted and in particular in the building um you know building materials um space but even more broadly you know in some electronics items and these sorts of things as well this is having a two-fold um effect first is in in pricing so in many cases that the prices are going up um and the second is just in the availability the at the outright availability um or the the lead times for some items the other um impact uh relates to lockdowns and border crossings so um as I mentioned before you know there's a number of of significant events that are occurring and under management at any time nationally the insurance industry workforce can almost be considered as a national workforce and and insurers you know will will sort of move um their teams uh around to to respond where where they're most needed and that model if you like has been really really challenged um throughout the pandemic with either the inability to to cross the border into a other way is often um an even more significant challenge so uh when you know we would cycle um you know people through in sort of two week or four week sort of blocks uh getting getting them home um has been a real um challenge or just impossible um as well then uh you know the the actual might not be the border crossing that's the issue but um the the lockdowns that might be in place you know a perfect example is the construction industry lockdowns in victoria earlier in the year so an industry specific lockdown you know created really significant challenges for for the insurance industry and the supply chains to respond we've been doing quite a bit of advocacy um insurance council has been doing quite a bit of advocacy in this space um and we have we have made some progress in terms of the the emergency management protocol being um updated to include insurance disaster responders we're also mindful that this particular issue will start to become less of a factor as as borders start to open so for example are on track to open um the 17th of december and these issues you know start to start to go away for us I'll stop there I hope there's been something you found insightful and useful in amongst there I'm really keen to hear questions and and feedback that anyone has thank you so much liam that was a really great presentation and some really really useful content and I think like I said it's so important not just to think of insurance when we're in recovery mode after a disaster but also to think about it beforehand so that when disaster does arise we we can be as resilient as possible um through having the means to recover with insurance with support from our insurance so really really great content we do have a couple of questions in the chat and the first question was one that came up yesterday um and this resident is online again today um so the question is in regards to the pitch of the tile group of the home it was deemed by the assessor inspection at 18 correct build to code the house was built in 1984. the assessor from the nrma has said that they cannot warrant the repairs we don't understand how we could pay for 35 years insurance and it all comes down to the pitch of the roof that's uh sorry that's uh that's a pretty technical question um thank you look um what I would say there is that um if something was built so there's there will always be an issue if something's not being built to code right so as at the time it wasn't built to code that that has the potential to create issues straight up the the second um the second point to that is um or that comes into consideration there is well did did the home owner know about that or could they have reasonably you know been expected um you know to know about so you know for example if the owner was the person that did the building then they there probably would be a quite a high expectation they would have known that but the done the pre-inspection uh you know the inspection report on that kind of thing and you know that didn't raise any issues you know as has done what they could reasonably do if it's built to code then of itself you know shouldn't be a problem um in terms of in terms of the insurance per se but there can be some issues that arise with new building combined with old building to to put it that way so where a structure was built to code um you know at the time but then there's some new building that's sort of going to that that that can be an issue for builders so my my advice on on that one is wherever your insurer is making a decision they should be explaining that to you the basis of that decision in the first instance and you should feel absolutely entitled to ask as many questions as you need to um in order to fully understand um you know that that basis right so in this case they've said it's it's 18 degrees _''_8868.56 question that sort of you know might flow on from that is why why does that mean that it's that's not that it's not warranted so I think um digging digging a little bit uh deeper with your insurer is really really important to really get to the to the bottom of why that decision is being made and then at any point during that process if if you if you just don't agree or don't accept that decision um then you can you have access to to the complaints process that you know that both alexandra you know and I have have spoken to beautiful thanks so much um another question from community is there a checklist that people can use when considering insurance for both residents and businesses is there a benchmark or framework for home and business replacement for example per square metre for understanding that contents is different yep um so so I'm sort of interpreting from that sort of a checklist of like how to figure out what my some insured might be um yeah look this is a space and there's not an ideal I'll just be you know straight up there's not an ideal there's not an ideal solution for this um the you know the square meter one that is so so fraught because it's an it's sort of an average of averages right and almost no individual property will be the average you know what I mean so that's I would that's that could be quite dangerous and unfortunately many of the calculators that are out there um sort of are at that really high level uh a number of the insurers or all insurers will will have some insured calculators that will sort of guide through the the the difficult part with that is where there are those bal um considerations um and and the flooding considerations so yeah look it's not a great I don't have a great answer for that one and I think it's it really um is a great question because it it highlights that there's no sort of simple there's no simple solution for that I though that I can I'll take a note because I think ica you know can have a can have a role in this space and and if it really is you know a need well it it really is a need I think is the point um you know to help folks um understand you know what what sort of coverage they need so it's a really good question it highlights there's no simple solution that's great thanks liam um the next question is what is being done to advise people around under insurance and is there anything being done to eliminate around people with no insurance what's being done that's a that's a tricky one we acknowledge that there is a a broad issue with with under insurance uh nationally it's not a um it's not a um you know it's not isolated um I think part of the solution uh part of the solution is around education so um you know part of what you know what I spoke to was um you know to try and bring of mind um I think that the question around um you know are there calculators are there tools to help us I think that draws out that there is a bit of a deficiency in that space and an opportunity um to build tools um and it it wouldn't be appropriate to ignore um the fact that in many cases the the reason there is under insurance is because of the affordability of insurance and that really links into sort of my first comments around the cost um the cost of natural disasters and that is a cost that's increasing year on year uh it's quite you know it's quite breathtaking it's just super critical that um we're advocating for change in that space and that there is a commitment federally and at stake at local levels to investing um you know in in resilience and mitigation and I mean what we're doing here today is is absolutely um you know absolutely part of that I know that one's a little you know that's a a little bit further removed from really really important critical part of that conversation it sort of has a bit of a flow onto that liam so one of the things that we have seen in some of our recent disaster events he touched on uh with your answer there was around the fact that we're seeing people with very high excesses that people are setting their excess quite high to bring down to make insurance more affordable for them um I've one question that was asked to me recently was around whether or not that excess if a person does need to make a claim and having issues with paying their excess can that be deducted from a cash settlement amount or an insurance settlement um if they go through that process yeah so look where um and again this is this is in general there's a sort of a general statement the the policies and I don't mean the the product disclosure statement I mean sort of the internal policies and processes will be slightly different at each insurer but in general terms if a claim is um going to's the the standard thing that happens I mean it would you know it would be sort of inefficient for someone to pay their you know excess and then get another you know sort of check so that's pretty well you know pretty well standard if someone is has challenges with paying their excess then it could be the case that you know they're suffering some financial hardship um at that point in time or in fact you know the requirement to pay um the excess you know would put them in financial hardship and there are provisions set out in the general insurance code of practice that talks through if someone is experiencing financial hardship um what insurers will do and are required to do in those situations so very simply um you know the advice to everyone is if you are in that situation is to contact your insurer and and talk to them about financial hardship that's great thanks leonard that is something that comes up um has come up quite a bit in our recent storm event another question that came up in that was frequently asked during the 2019-20 bushfires as well was around where there's wear and tear on a property so what we have heard from some residents is that they're in older buildings and they had um obviously an insured value of the property and agreed value of the property that they've been paying their insurance for but then um when the assessors came out um there's sort of a question about what damage was wear and tear on the building from age or um property maintenance is another thing that we've seen referred to as well lack of property maintenance in some insurance documents and that bringing out the bringing down the cash settlement amount if a person feels as though they've they're sort of an unreasonable amount of costs that's been deducted for wear and tear or age of the building how would they go about getting support to to advocate on on their behalf for sure so I think that the first thing that I'd call out is that there's a um whenever an insurance sort of you know questions that are asked and some of those questions will be asked again um at the renewal or through the renewal process uh and whether that's you know phoning up to to do that renewal or in or in writing and it's a it's a general um sort of expectation that the property that's being insured is sort of maintained you know in is reasonably maintained to to use to use that language now that's going to be different for different types of property right the the condition or the expected condition you know of a home that was built two years ago um is going to be different than uh you know a building or a home you know that's 70 years old for example right so that but the expectation is different but the the principle the the property is sort of you know well maintained and properly maintained for its age is sort of an expectation that that sits there um the uh so if there has been some adjustment um of a of a settlement um because a sort of alleged lack of maintenance then if if that's not reasonable or customer doesn't deem that reasonable my advice in the first instance is always talk you know is talk to your insurer um about it and I guess back to the point that I was making before um you know don't ever you know don't ever feel like you shouldn't ask clarifying questions right often it'll be statements like you know where and terrible what do you know what did you mean by that what you know what would the expectations have been you know to to dig down into it but um certainly the the complaints process so I think the what I would say about the complaint process is is that doesn't have to be that's not about being a um a combative uh process it's not pistols adorned with with your insurance it's a process it's a formal process that exists specifically for the situations where there there's a disagreement and it's there for customers to access where you know you any reason so um I always you know always say have that open line of communication ask ask questions um to to really clarify but that complaint process ultimately the reason that it's there is if you you can't get on the same page with your insurer then look to access that that process for um you know sort of a you know a review and and that can then potentially depending on you know the how that progresses that you know potentially leads to um you know being able to access um the external uh process with africa excellent that's a that's a great response um that's very helpful I had another question the two that sort of relate to each other one is around a scope of work so a question that has come up a few times in the last couple of weeks is around where a cash a proposed cash settlement is maybe going to take place and a resident is given a scope of works for the insurance company but the quoted amounts for repair are redacted is that common where people are asked to seek additional scope of works before making a decision about a cash settlement um yes yes it is it is common um so the the reason the reason for that is that in most cases not all cases in most cases um insurers have um um supplier panels so uh you know they go through a um you know a procurement process a tendering process to find builders um you know in engineers and any kind of other suppliers that they will contract with to um do the insurance repairs the the rates um you know the labor rates and the margins on those rates and even you know material prices in in some cases um are all actually dealt with in in those commercial agreements between the insurer um and the in that builder and are commercially sensitive for that for that reason so it's common that that type of detail is is redacted um from from um scopes of work um what shouldn't be redacted or or there's no reason that I can there's no reason that I can line item detail of a of a scope um you know so you know 40 meters of you know 40 meters of chip rock supply you know and install but that I don't see any reason why that should be redacted and in fact you know it being redacted is problematic in terms of being able to communicate actually what's in and out of scope or for getting you know comparison quotes um and also what um I don't see is a reason that should be redacted is sort of the overall price right um so um that ultimately is is important as well because that would be ultimately the number that uh that a cash settlement is based on um you know or in you know to come to be able to compare the pricing um you know with a with another builder so um yeah that unit that unit sort of level pricing so uh you know hourly rates and and those sorts of things will will typically be redacted because of that commercial sensitivity but the the line item detail um and the the be redacted and it would be counterproductive to do that so if if anyone is um you know receiving a scope of work with that information is sort of also redacted then I think that that's a question uh well that's a challenge back to to the insurer to sort of say well how can I you know how do I know what is in is actually in the scope you know and how could I uh you know get you know you know quote if I wanted to as well that's great thank you that that will be um that's really helpful information sort of along those lines too so we have people who've been asked to go out and get their own scope of works on top of their um the one the scope works from the insurance company and it's sort of it's creating a bit of nerves for some people because of the delay we're getting tradesmen out to do those scope of works assessments and the floor one from that is that people then become quite nervous rental property while they rebuild or repair is there any scope for residents who are facing delays with their rebuild or with their repair work to ask for an extension of that 12 months of rental assistance that's covered by an insurance company um look there is certainly always scope to have you know to have that to have that conversation um this is I've just made a note of of that um of that one in particular because it's something that I'll I'll take away um to have a chat with the with the insurer group about so I think um the first the first thing is um it's not it's not unheard of that um sure might ask uh you know someone to get a quote but I'm sort of inclined I i do understand in these current circumstances um that that might create you know a bit of a bit of nervousness so I think in the first instance again I i I come back to you know a point about asking questions you know don't don't't ask a question or you shouldn't ask a question the first thing that comes to mind for there is why do you want me to go and get you know why do you want me to go and get these quotes so you know can you go and get uh other quotes for example you know can you leverage your agreements yeah you know to make that happen more quickly right so that's sort of the first thing there um the second thing is yeah absolutely uh as part of that conversation um raise the concerns um you know about about that time frame and a question maybe to ask is so if it was the case that um because of some because of this delay and the size of my repair that it was to go beyond 12 months what what what would you do what what would you do in those circumstances in terms of you know my temporary accommodation and at that at that point they'll give an answer um and that then becomes a sort of a trigger point potentially for for not a if that's not a satisfactory um outcome from your perspective then then that might be a trigger to sort of let them know that you're not happy about that and that you that you want um that you want it reviewed as a general statement um you know it is certainly not lost on insurers um the impacts in the supply chain it's really it is significant um and you know we are seeing pricing um as I mentioned you know pricing is changing um there are lead you know lead times are growing and growing in terms of you know supply of materials um the the border challenges although you know that will start to ease has meant that there's you know also been a real strain on just the availability of of trades as well so these these are factors that are well known and understood with insurers and they do understand the flow on impacts of that so I i can't commit them to anything and nor would it be appropriate to I just wanted to um you know just you know aren't ignored or lost uh on the insurer group but but certainly I've made a note here myself I think that's a really that's a really good question to be asking and I love the forward thinking uh you know uh uh element of it as well uh it's something I want to raise with with the insurer group certainly so we've got one in the chat but you've largely answered the majority of it so it's more about the the scopes of works um blacked out um they've been told to go ahead and get their own builder contract reports but there's no builders available so you just touched on that answer there I guess the one that's remaining for this question the quotes then get forwarded to the insurance company do they meaning the insurance company pay the higher value or hand over the low adult dollar value do I have a choice yeah this also adds the anxiety of getting my house back to normal sure um the first the first part of my a little bit sharp um but but I hope um I hope um it it's taken uh taken in um no one um no one would would pay on a like-for-like basis so I'll just call that out first critical like for like basis no one would pay the higher amount I i wouldn't personally I challenge with it with it whether anyone would on a like-for-like basis and that's the that's the critical point to it and that's why it's really really important that that line that line item detail is available in the scopes right if one scope of work is just you know numbers for the sake of numbers you know one scope of work is 150 000 and another scope of work is 120 000 but 120 000 only has two thirds say of you know the the scope um called out and that other third is actually required you know in order to rebuild the property then that is um totally not appropriate that the settlement you know would be based on on the lower amount in in match a hundred percent in terms of uh you know in terms of those uh line items you know they're both reputable licensed um you know builders essentially the same and one is you know quoting 150 000 and the other one is quoting 140 000 then then 140 000 will be that will be the basis of the settlement if that that builder can do that is prepared to do that scope of work for that price then that's what um you know the basis of the settlement will be but it's it must be like for like um that's the the key and you know a an indicator that something's not like for like as if there is a huge difference in price I i have to say um if if it is all on the same basis um you know someone's not going to be able to you know build a rate quotes for 150 build a bees you know quotes a hundred thousand I mean you're not going to be able to do the same work at that sort um you know something to be mindful of is if there are two quotes and they're hugely different in terms of price then that that is a that's a pretty solid indicator that there's they're not on the they're not on a like for like basis there's something there's something not right there so um like for like basis has to be like for like basis but the the lower um the lower the lower price um will will always be the settlement I challenge you know anyone really um to on that one that no one would pay the higher price if if everything is if everything is equal just one more question before we wrap up liam and it's a question that comes up I think after all different types of natural disasters particularly in rural areas like holland delhi and which caribbean is something that people never think about with their insurance policies quite often around trees and they clean up the dangerous trees after so one of the questions that we get asked a lot is around I ground or clearing of fallen trees and things might be considered by an insurance company a lot of people are told that it's only trees that will be a threat to structures or neighbouring properties um is that are you able to give a bit of query about what people's expectations might be around cleanup yeah yeah absolutely um so as a gen you know so this is general right I have to say you know you you have to consider your specific um product disclosure statement and if you are you know shopping around you know you have to consider those those different product disclosure statements but in general um uh home you know domestic home insurance policies don't cover um the land and uh in the um flora that might be on that land so gardens and trees and that sort of thing just as a general principle right then they're not considered part of the building or part of the contents which is you know the two sort of top level um you know categories of property in a home insurance policy in called removal of debris right so uh in the context of of trees um what that generally means is that if a a tree or part of a tree has cause damage to the property to what the the what's called sort of the insurable property so that'll generally be the you know the building and the contents and and and fences like boundary fences are generally you know included in that definition if a part of a tree or a tree has fallen and caused damage to those um items of property um and that and that that was caused by an insured event so it didn't just sort of fall you know of its uh own volition uh you know because it was um uh you know unwell uh then generally that that will be covered uh by the removal of debris will be covered um under the policy um that's that's really it uh in terms of in terms of the coverage if um there are and sometimes it's sort of referred to you know sort of trees in the field fall or or are damaged as a result of an insured of an insured event if they don't um cause subsequent damage to property um then then they're not they're not covered um under the claim um the other one is um is dangerous so in the example where a um you know large branch comes off of a tree in a big storm and lands on a landsat of homes that causes damage you know that's sort of cleaned up and removed but there may well be that that damaged tree there that's much more of a much more of a gray area and insurers will typically you know consider the the imminent risk um that that sort of exists there to to damaging um the insurable property but is really sort of a you know a case by a case-by-case proposition there are some um and not not many um but there are a couple of products um in market that um offer um I suppose you'd call them you know premium products so they they extend the cover in some of sort of buy an add-on you know to to extend the coverage for those benefits but as a general principle if it if it hasn't sort of fallen onto um the insurable property uh and cause damage then um then it's it's not um covered under under the policy great thank you so much liam that was so informative obviously it's a hot topic um if there are any more questions what we'll do is we'll forward them on to you and provide those contact details yeah beautiful so thank you so much thank you to everyone that's joined us today um we appreciate your time thank you for taking time out of the beautiful saturday um tomorrow we do have ann ledbetter and the recovery support service joining us tomorrow from 10 a.m so please make sure you tune in grab a cup of coffee and spend the morning with us um but again thank you so much for having us today anything else you wanted to add no just a huge thank you to all of our speakers today I think it's often the first time that they've made an insurance claim or the first time that they've maybe needed to access legal support or other support services so just to have more information about how to go through that process is invaluable and I think it's going to be yeah really valuable for our residents that were impacted by the fires and storms beautiful right well thank you and see you tomorrow thanks everybody thanks everyone how do you catch

my office our contact details are on the website reach out to my office and we'll make the time for you to come in and have a chat for me the most successful councils are the ones where there's a strong working relationship between the ceo the executive and the elected council and my role as I see it particularly over the next few months is to prepare the organisation and and to really work in partnership elected council deliver on the priorities next slide please so a brief introduction now obviously you all know um that wallendilly's a beautiful place it's full of natural beauty it has a warm and generous community it has a rich history as well um and to me for for someone who's coming relatively fresh to walla dilli I've been here for almost two years um I really believe it's a land of opportunity and and council's role really as custodians the land is the is to grab these opportunities with both hands and make wall in delhi hopefully an even better place than it is today um but you know also that we've got some big challenges ahead of us um as the shy grows and changes you know the population is growing now um decisions made over the past 10 years mean that the population is growing and more people are moving in in towns and villages all over the shire from silverdale to the oaks the victim tamil thurby and dan debargo and of course we've got wilton as well families moving in every day and we also have some some big challenges ahead with landowners pushing hard for further growth in happen you know for me council's role in this growth journey is to shape it to work hard to create beautiful places and secure the infrastructure we need for our community roads public transport schools health services the locals the local facilities like open space sporting fields community and aquatic centers libraries you know our job really is to build community and to create a way of life so I think it's a real honour to work for council or to be a council law because you you have that opportunity to really shape and build a community so congratulations as I said earlier for putting your hand up um and considering running for council now this council I think has made some good progress um on wilton for example but really um the next council term will be the where the rubber hits the road and where the population does increase dramatically the other area in my view that this incoming council has as should so as I said earlier my role is to work in partnership with the council um and to enhance the organization to improve its efficiency and do it in a financially sustainable way but but more than anything to set us up set us up properly to successfully manage the growth that's that's upon us now you know our our priority really our focus is creating a high performing organization and and one that I think our community expects and deserves um but that'll need some investment it'll need some critical thinking around better technologies around efficiencies around improved customer service and also investment in operational facilities like new depots for our recreational staff and offices for our office staff because we'll need to grow the organization if we're really gonna effectively service our growing population another key challenge I think for for the incoming council and it's not all challenges a lot of its opportunities but a key challenge is also the creation of local jobs uh a whole lot of our population leaves the shire and the creation of local jobs I believe should be a key focus of the future council as well my job is to lead the organization on your behalf and to work with you the elected council if you're successful in getting elected to make the most of the opportunities for boris um you know for me um the way we deliver services is relatively straightforward um I work with you the executive works with you the management team works with you as the elected council if you're successful in getting elected to set up what's called the community strategic plan which is our 10-year plan for the for the area the four-year delivery program and the one-year operational plan and these documents these plans will be developed in the first nine months of the new council and it's these plans that will determine where we spend our funds where we allocate our resources and the structure of these documents is built around five key themes which are there on your screen right now so sustainable and balanced growth the management revision of infrastructure caring for the environment looking after the community to the next slide for me please the council has approximately 300 staff that I lead to deliver on the priorities adopted by the elected council in those documents and we have an organizational framework and that organizational framework is designed to effectively deliver on the key priorities that council sets it's made up of four directorates and I've asked each of the directors to outline their role and key priorities for you now so first of all I'm going to hand over to ali dench executive director community corporate to kick us off ali over to you well thanks ben this is a great opportunity to have a chat to those that are running and it's just wonderful to see the number of people here this evening to find out more information um about how how we can work together to do that so yeah my name's ali dench and I'm executive director for community and corporate uh and this particular area uh looks after lots of of the back office stuff I suppose you could say for council around information technology our experience function we have a graphic geographic information system which is all the mapping and looking at how how all our areas are mapped across the shire and we also um in this director look after future innovation and a lot of the smart cities initiatives smart shire initiatives in the area as ben said uh our role we have a big role to play in building communities and part of that is around community development so we work very closely with lot of local organizations and groups in the area such as men's sheds and run the seniors cafe connect and youth advisory committee we also at the library which continues to provide a really wide range and variety of support services to the community and part of that library service is also our mobile service so as we reach out across to all different parts of the show we provide children services in the form of family day care across the shire and year-round care services and we're also preparing in the future looking at a new preschool service to community based style preschool service we run every year and also to we're looking at running in partnership the uh thermi festival of steam in the future and we run a whole heap of other local community events we're looking at a summer festival event we've been running a whole heap of community recovery and resilience events after the the um disasters that we've the bushfire disaster that we had to develop community connectedness uh my area also looks after communications and engagement and advocacy work so which is a very important part of the council's function is to advocate on behalf of the community to state and federal governments around lots of important issues such as health and well-being public schools and has been highlighted around business investment and jobs health services and also improved telecommunications in the area so as as the shire is growing our challenge will be to opportunities and make sure we've got connected communities we have a number of key focus areas to enhance service delivery and organisational performance that we are looking at and one of those areas is around our recovery and meant that our focus has really been on how we assist our community in recovery and resilience journey for this reason we're looking at how we have implemented things we're doing a continuous improvement review on our actions and also to we're like making sure that we're implementing best practice approaches to emergency management and disaster recovery uh we actually have just adopted the activate woolen deli 2021 long-term resilience and recovery plan which will guide an action-focused approach to programs and activities across the shire and a lot of these programs and initiatives have been identified through community forums and residence feedback which is again is a big role for council to ensure that residents voices are heard uh and incorporated into the development of these pla plans such as this uh we support and promote small business and tourism activities across the shire we're implemented I'm sure you would have heard about the love to dilly campaign encouraging people to shop local we're about to establish a smart working hub at the old post office and launch a new visitor guide supports and information services such as our community newsletter our business newsletters and and facebook page we're focusing on technology into the um our key priorities we're focusing on technology improvements uh to improve customer experience and our community engagement and communication processes as the community grows it's going to be really really important for council to maintain and encourage more engagement and participation and recently we have taken a big leap forward I believe in online customer service with the introduction of our new customer service portal and other online service opportunities such as our payments online and da applications and lodgements online we have online engagement tools and a facebook page and other channels that we use to ensure communities are engaged cohesive and also included in giving feedback and information to to council particularly in decision making processes we are improving our customer experience through the development of customer experience plans across all our areas of council and also we're looking at how we can enhance the customer service portal that we have in place and also implementing a range of proposed initiatives of council and making sure that our systems are integrated and we're looking at how we can implement community uh continuous improvements in this area it's a journey as we grow as a as an organisation and one that we really welcome the input from councillors and community in in assisting us in that journey thanks ben thanks very much ali um that gives you a very quick um whistlestop tour they're counsellors of the community and corporate directorate um and I suppose you can see very clearly how many things it is that council looks after this is just one of our directorates and as you can see there's a bunch of roles there that we we play in the community and most of you know alI's focus is internal but also very much community based um so I was remiss at the start actually that um I was going to I'm going to stop after the presentations from each of the directors um so if there's any questions that you have on those specific elements of what we're doing about or about the specific roles um that we're playing in each of the directorates then I'll actually ask you to bring them in after after the fourth directorate which is matt tara so um right now I'm going to hand over to tony avery to look after planning thanks ben good evening everyone and it's a really great opportunity to talk to you about we what we do in the planning directorate picking up on a couple of the themes that both ben and ali touched on it's all about growth we have our major function in planning for growth to ensure that that growth is sustainable and well-serviced with infrastructure and to look after our community and our environment so they're the main driving themes for what we do our directorate has three branches it's just strategic planning is called sustainable growth development services and our health and regulatory services area which looks after a range of functions including compliance but also things like environmental health animal management functions our animal shelter and of course our routine registrations of such things as the health and regulatory services area does is statutory in other words it's set by legislation and it's not something that we have much discretion about it's something that the state has a has required us to do in terms of strategic planning our function is largely about planning for growth and we have a lot of that coming to us now and into the future as noted there our current population is expected to double by 2036 and we need to make sure that we're ready for that growth and we have a sound blueprint for growth our growth is our vision for growth is set by our local strategic planning statement which is called wallendilly2040 and there's a an image of the front cover of that publication it was finalized in march last year a massive piece of work to set the vision for walnut shire for the next 20 years it sits alongside our community strategic plan to provide clear direction and inform council on decision making going forward to look after our population now and as I said into the next planning statement is an enviable enviable lifestyle of historic villages modern living rural lands and bush I think what's really important about that document is that it actually values what we have now and what makes walindilla unique while planning to accommodate the growth that is coming it provides I suppose ground rules for what we want to see in that growth and how we want to see the new communities develop our main growth area is wilton and I'll go on to talk about that now mel could you please move to the next slide thank you so we're we're planning for our growing population at wilton so the wilton growth area is a a it's an area that's been gazetted by the state government as a growth area the population for wilton is estimated to grow to about 50 000 people so when we talk about our population doubling by 2036 most of that growth will be in the wilton area it's an exciting time for wilton we have a town centre that is about to be re-zoned the minister for that it's re-zoned in spring which could be any time between september and november what's really important to um council in terms of that rezoning is that the infrastructure to support it is guaranteed by the developer by the state and we're in the process of continuing our advocacy and negotiation around that to make sure that new town is going to be a real opportunity for employment it's going to be an opportunity for community activities and a whole range of recreational and community facilities as well as a great place to live another exciting point about wilton is that council had a strong vision that wilton would be a unique place a sustainable place and set a model as an exemplar of new planning we've been working with the state government to ensure that those principles are enshrined and that wilton will have a an extensive tree canopy and it will have areas for community to recreate and enjoy blending in with the natural environment I'll just move on to a couple of those other points there the first point on there was noted earlier about the importance of creating jobs and supporting employment and business within the shire and these changes are designed to facilitate that so lep stands for local environment plan and it sets our planning rules our framework for what happens in development this is another statutory document and it's a requirement that development complies with the provisions of the local environment plan if we want to change the rules around development we have to change the lep and we're in the process of doing that at this very moment to achieve those outcomes that are noted there our first lep change is really around celebrations and community events it's about facilitating the opportunity for community events across a wide range of different land types in the shire and it's also about supporting activities in the rural areas that are also celebrations things like weddings and also tourist accommodation we're looking at um bringing in the opportunity for tourist parks so that's that's actually in the pipeline at the moment it may well be that that change goes to the department been exhibited the second part of that change is about the visitor economy and that's about changing those planning rules to enable a whole range of other uses to occur within our rural zones again to help support the rural economy and to support our rural landowners and to bring people into the shire to enjoy what we enjoy about it and to grow jobs sec the third point down there is revitalizing picton we have uh exciting news to announce our pickton place plan which will set the direction for the future of the picton town centre was endorsed by council last night what that is um what that does is change the planning rules proposes to change the planning rules for the picton town centre and it will enable a lot of activation and again create jobs central to that of course is our picton precinct but I'll leave that for michael malone to talk about in his discussion in a few minutes economic recovery and jobs are a key platform for council and to that end one of our our priorities this year is to re-zone employment lands so that more jobs can be established particularly in our growth area around malden and around wilton we anticipate creating 15 000 jobs for fifteen thousand dwellings we're also focused on improving our development assessment processes and a lot of work has been put into this into recent times in the first instance we've been working on our planning portal with the state government to enable faster lodgement more streamlined assessment services we also have a da tracker on our website which enables you to follow any development application that's lodged in the shire we're excited about two new positions that were approved in the recent budget the first one is an executive planner and that role is to act as a facilitator a concierge a provide red carpet treatment if you like for development and investment in the shire the second one is a duty planner that's a position that will work with mums and dads it will help guide people through the planning process and support customer service in the work that um ali talked about earlier we're excited offer on the judy planner and it's been accepted so we hope to have that person starting within a matter of weeks in talking about wilton we have to acknowledge that a big part of our role is not only doing the planning but also advocating to the state government not only the department of planning but all of the state agencies for the provision the timely provision of the essential infrastructure to support that growth that's been a big focus of the council over the last term and it's certainly something that council officers have focused on in our engagement with the department of planning and other agencies and of course with the development industry wilton is a is an area that requires a lot of infrastructure we have many priorities transport is a big one education facilities community facilities and public transport and we'll continue to advocate for that infrastructure as the town grows and finally I mentioned about the health and regulatory services environment that's essential department that's essentially what we're doing there it's about protecting the environment in we are operating safely that businesses are operating safely and that our community is uh protected and preserved that's um all I'll cover for now but I'm happy to answer questions later on um thanks ben thanks very much tony uh much appreciated there's definitely a lot happening in the planning world so next move over to michael malone the director infrastructure environment michael thank you ben and good evening everybody yes my name is michael malone I'm the director infrastructure environment and I'm privileged to work with about 120 members of council's organization to look after nearly all of the assets for the shire for the community of the shire which is just over 900 million dollars worth and we do this across five main areas uh the first one being infrastructure operations which predominantly looks after the construction and maintenance of um our assets that's uh patching the roads resealing them reconstructing them the footpaths uh the drains the pits etc um and and they're the the main group that look after that 870 odd kilometers of roads that section they look after all those sporting fields the play equipment the two aquatic areas they have the pools the public toilets whatnot and they plan for the future as our as our community uh grows and changes in its expectations of how it would like to recreate and live in our environment uh the waste and environmental services team sounds pretty obvious they look after all the waste issues for the the shire so they manage domestic waste collection and processing they also run a landfill down at the bargo waste management centre where they're currently planning the introduction of a community recycling center that team also does the environmental sustainability and biodiversity planning and strategies for the shire looking after those big picture items such as the integrated water strategy and the shire wide koala plan of management the next section is our property and projects area they manage our property portfolio all those bits of land that we hold across the shire and those bits of land that we have to acquire sometimes to widen roads or or get areas to work such as allowing the manage our larger more complicated projects such as the image the showing on the screen there the the construction of the roundabout at the intersection of remembrance drive and finns road at the corridor uh the tarmal sporting complex the uh that that's the netball courts that were finished earlier this year and the athletics track um and the wallendilly community cultural and civic precinct and the pathway work that's currently underway at the old monagle school site an angle the next one means least section is the assets transport and engineering area they have the almighty task of trying to understand and manage those 900 odd million dollars worth of assets and have a plan to renew those assets and replace them or make them bigger to service the existing community and the growing community that's the team that put together that five-year roadworks program that's currently showing on our website but in addition to that they also do a lot of background work work in the traffic and transport area working out for example why do we need to fix that intersection of finns best solution for the traffic that we'll be dealing with over the next decade or so that team also looks after the subdivision process so we do the subdivision expect inspections and receipt those new uh road and footpath assets that the the developers want to see to council that team is responsible for making sure that we're receiving assets that are fit for purpose for the long term not just for the term of that development next slide please for the uh the next financial year 2122 some of the key things that the infrastructure and environment section will be looking after we will be delivering a capital works program that will exceed 33.7 million dollars in which we will be doing an 18 million dollar program of works to continue fixing the roads across the shire with that asset management focus will be maintaining our financial sustainability for asset management making sure that those assets are looked after the to the extent that we can with the resources that are available to us we will be continuing to deliver the voluntary community cultural and civic precinct arts center at the corner of banangle street and colden street the new child care building behind the shire hall and finishing the refurbishment of the shire hall so that if you are the successful new council we will have a suitable place for you to hold those monthly council meetings so you instead of the building that we're currently residing in which is well and truly showing its age we'll also be continuing to procure the next waste collection and management contracts because our current contracts fall due in 2024 and as you would expect that's a rather large and challenging procurement process to go to go through um this year with the benefit of some grants that we've just applied for that we are very confident we will be receiving will be finishing the next large stage of the tarmal sporting complex with the construction of the 4.6 million dollar multi-purpose amenities building to work right next to the new the 12 new nepal courts and the new athletics track thank you christoph thanks very much michael definitely a lot on in your space toro assistant director people legal and governance matthew thank you ben and good evening everybody and uh thank you for all the opportunity to come and meet you all this evening and I'm really here tonight to give you a very very brief introduction to what the office of the ceo being the people legal and governance function of council does so firstly the corporate governance function and some of the fantastic team members are here tonight hosting and what really the corporate governance function's about is about looking after our councillors first and foremost and to enable them to carry out their civic functions and to do a number of other tasks associated with that such as running our monthly council meetings our community forums our briefings and other formal forums of council we're also the team responsible for publishing the monthly business paper that's put out to the community and enables our councillors to make decisions on behalf of our community we look after the overall framework of the council as well when it comes to what our council policies are our delegations the other policies procedures we also look after our insurance and risk management portfolio as part of that team another area of my responsibility is our people and culture team and what this is is really our human resources and our people services function at council so this includes all our staff learning and development our payroll services work health and safety and our staff engagement which is very important as ben said in the introduction we have 300 staff and that's growing it's across what is a very diverse multi-disciplinary workforce we have field staff we have professional staff and a variety other different staff in multiple positions across the council so it's a it's a really I guess a a fantastic staff cohort that we have and um you know it's very much through our staff that we achieve great things for the community um the next part of my portfolio is the legal function in the city pretty self-explanatory it provides I guess a range of legal services to our counselors and to our staff corporate strategy and the integrated planning and reporting and what this is is about is I guess really setting out our corporate plans for our organization and the council so when the when we uh have the new councillors come on board after the september election one of the first things that our councillors will be doing is developing our new csp and our delivery program and our delivery program as ben said in each reduction is really about our aspirations and our strategies and our outcomes that the new council want to achieve over the next three years so it's our key document that is providing I guess guidance to our staff and our organization of all the things that um the new council wants to achieve so it's a very critical document and my team will be working directly with the new council to obviously formulate what their plans are for the next three year term over to the next slide please mel so some of the key strategic priorities for the years ahead for the people legal and governance function continuing to have a highly engaged and supported workforce we recently did a our council actually scored in the top 10 of councils for our overall staff engagement and I i put that down to all the the great work that all of our executive leadership team has been doing and our management team has been doing working with our staff to get those results as I said before getting having I guess a highly engaged and motivated workforce leads only to good outcomes for the community the next key priority area for us is developing a business enhancement plan so what this is about is really about I guess looking at all the growth that is coming get I guess setting out a clear plan for the future about how we'll grow our organization how we'll continue to provide high performing services to our customers and the community and what changes and adaptions that we need to make along the way and part of that comes as to the next priority which is about investment in our resources so this is about as part of the planning process for responding to our growth it's about giving our staff the practices to be able to continue to deliver for our community and through obviously that growth and that pressure on our services we'll need to continue to invest in our staff and our resources to continue to deliver for the community last but not least is implementing a variety of other local government reforms so the state government and the office of local government have introduced a number of reforms to the local government sector over the last few years and what this is about is about really enhancing the risk culture and also the the governance practices of councils across new south wales so many councils are going down the path of this you know introducing these new reforms um we're well our front of the curve of those reforms and we've implemented a number of key things in our organization to enable us to have good risk management practices our audit risk and improvement committee which is an independent committee that has oversight of our functions that's one example of something that we've already introduced which some other councils don't actually have our processes our improvement opportunities and as well as our finances as well so that's a brief introduction into the people legal and governance function thank you ben thanks very much matt um uh would you mind just turning the presentation off please mel and uh what we might do now for everyone who's part of part of this meeting it is a bit clunky I know I'd much prefer to be meeting us in person but um it is what it is so we need to follow the rules so um now no I'd like to just pause here for a second and open up for any questions um if you do have a question um and you're part of the panel you can raise your hand um not physically raise your hand because I can't actually see everyone on the screen um you'll need to press the raise hand button um and then our wonderful governance staff will identify you and and um and bring you across to ask your question question so while I do that um alexis is there a question no one at this stage with their hand up but there is one written question okay would you like to read that out for me please yeah so the question uh is from an anonymous person the question is how are we planning on getting enough water the plan is already a billion dollars short as stated in last night's meeting how are you planning on paying for everything when we don't have nearly enough money water or data okay good question um that's a great great for us um for asking that one tony can you answer that one please as the director planning yes thanks ben and yeah thanks for the question it's certainly a topical issue in the shire and and it was top of mind particularly during the doubt the drought period um a couple of years ago so as I mentioned earlier in planning for wilton a big part of the planning for wilton is planning for the infrastructure and advocating for the infrastructure the state agencies are delivering the infrastructure and it's all about staging and sequencing a key focus of this community and this council and it's been something that we have addressed with sydney water many times throughout this planning period for wilton sydney water is the agency responsible for the provision of water and sewage services to our communities it's not a council function it's a sydney water function so it's a state government function we recognize the concerns that community have and we've had a water symposium symposium very recently here in wallendilly if you want to have a look at the detailed information that was provided by sydney water at that water symposium and the answers to a number of questions which are similar to this question please have a look at council's website and just go into the search bar under water symposium and you'll be able to have a look at the answers they've provided and in fact the presentation they delivered at the time sydney water has a plan to service wilton for both water and sewage but the plan is in progress they don't have everything on the ground're in the process of finalizing their service plans for growth sydney water has been working on the greater macarthur regional growth plan so that will cover the wilton growth area and the rest of the growth area there into appen and gilead and they're also at the moment working on the greater sydney water strategy which when it's approved by the state government will replace the metropolitan water plan those documents set the strategic framework and direction to ensure that the water needs of growing sydney not only in wilton and greater macarthur but all of sydney are met thanks ben thanks so much tony uh is there any other questions from anyone in the group there's no hands raised at the moment ben and no other written questions okay no worries um so we might move on then please um the next session we're just going to go through which is a little bit of the headlines in terms of the role of a council law um and starting first of all I suppose at the high level which is the the government framework in charge of everything um the federal government has its role in terms of medicare defense immigration foreign policy the state is responsible for roads housing uh prisons public transport police ambulance services and the for all of local councils is often described as roads race and rubbish but really predominantly as you've seen it's a broad range of services that we provide for the community a key role as well of local government is really to work in partnership with the state and federal governments to deliver those big ticket infrastructure priorities and also the high quality services and community services that some that are delivered for the people of delhi so um it's important just to have that framework in mind when you're thinking about the role of council and the role of a council law move on to the next slide please so the role of a council law uh we've pulled the wording directly out of the local government act as the single source of true truth and I won't go through all of these but I suppose what I is very clear in the role of a council law is to be an active and contributing member of the governing body you are one of you will be one of eight um council laws um around the table uh plus the elected mayor um who will govern um the the the function of wallendale shire council and the the role there really is to make conceited and well-informed decisions and our job as the organization is to provide you with that advice um without evidence so that you can can make those well-informed decisions on behalf of the community as a whole you're also responsible for participating in the integrated planning and reporting framework which matt talked about so the community's strategic plan the delivery plan the operational plan and also performing a key role to facilitate communication between the local community and the council as a group as accountable as as a counselor sorry um you're accountable to the local community for the performance of the council and ultimately the performance measure is the elections which happen normally every four years next slide please the law but also under the local government act the mayor is is classed as the leader of the council and also a leader in the community they're the principal member and spokesperson of the council uh they carry out civic and ceremonial functions such as australia um such as citizenship ceremonies they preside at meetings of the council as as the chair they also under the act are enabled to exercise urgent policy making functions between council meetings other functions as determined by council and also work closely with the general manager or in this case for walman delhi the ceo to on to deliver the strategic direction of the council uh and and to guide um the implementation of councils policies plans strategies and there's a whole lot more that's contained in section 226 of the local government act but we just went through some of the highlights here next slide please and then the role of the governing body so as a council or particularly as I said you're one of nine members of the governing body and your role collectively is to direct accordance with the local government act and also other relevant acts to provide effective civic leadership to the local community and I'm just going to stop on that one for a second because those words civic leadership I think are a really key key term for a council law and I think one of the one of the key challenges as well for for someone running for council is is the transition from being a community campaigner which is the role you need to play in the lead-up to the elections obviously to secure the votes you need to become a councillor to transition through to being a civic leader and the role of civic leader really is to provide leadership to the community but also to represent the collective views of the whole of the voladilyshire your role as a member of the governing body is to focus on the financial sustainability of council and the development of communities of the community strategic plan delivery program and other strategies plans programs strategies and policies and there's a there's a big list there and the reason why key role of the council around strategic and policy making so your role as an elected body is to really set those strategies to set those policies uh and then my job is to deliver or implement the the the decisions of council as quickly as I possibly can as efficiently as I possibly can as the governing body the council also determines the operational plan which is the annual budget of council and the things that we do uh in in the year in the financial year as well as the revenue and rating policy and to continually review the performance of council and also its delivery of services move over to the next slide please the um the role of the governing body continues I'm still going because there is a lot of points in the local government act is also to to determine the process for appointment of the general manager or as I said before in the case of wonderly the ceo and monitor the performance um to determine the senior staff positions within the organization structure so for well in delhi it's the staff positions uh and then to consult regularly with community organizations and other key stakeholders about council's decisions and activities and to consult with the general manager and the ceo in directing and controlling the affairs of council and the way the the the local government is established really is that the role of the governing body is a collective role in overseeing and guiding the direction of council um move over to the next slide for me please and lastly the role of the chief executive officer and staff so my primary role is to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the organization and also the implementation of the decisions of council so myself the executive team and also the managers throughout the organisation particularly um provide a lot of advice to councillors we provide recommendations we provide information notes we provide briefing sessions and they're all designed to assist council with the development and decision making of its strategic plans and policy and then once a decision is made by the elected council our job is to implement those decisions without undue delay my role the appointment directing and dismissing of staff and also exercising functions which are delegated by the council so the council has the ability to delegate to me some of its powers to improve the efficiency of the organization such as the um the approval of tenders which are largely operational matters which can save us a lot of time and actually speed up the ability of council to deliberate services to the community in terms of staff obviously their role is the day-to-day operations of the council to implement council policies and other decisions as directed by myself because there's a lot more obviously to the role of the staff but as containing the local dubbing act um that's how it's defined uh would you mind moving on to the next slide for me please okay so we're going to jump here into a bit of a toolkit for council laws and also some of the the key capabilities but before we do that I might just um if you don't mind please bell turning the presentation off again I might just pause for a in the group regarding any of the stuff that I've just whisked through relatively quickly now there's no written questions ben and no one seems to have their hand raised okay I might just pause for a second if anyone wants to ask any questions about the role of council or the role of the mayor or the role of the chief executive officer and staff then uh please put up your hand now where we also can come back later on um but I just want to pause right this second in case you have any burning questions you want to raise okay good well let's move back on then if you don't mind putting the presentation back on okay so toolkit for counsellors nice nice definition um so for me the the most successful councils that I've seen and the ones that really thrive in the role uh are those that have a passion for social justice and particularly your community I mean the council laws really you are putting yourself into into a leadership role on behalf of the community and and ones that are passionate about the community and delivering really positive outcomes for the community that they serve good communication and interpersonal skills um strategic thinking and the ability to solve problems we spend quite a bit of time or the council spends quite a bit of time together particularly council meetings working through problems and solving issues to come up with the best possible solution um good organization and time management it is a big commitment I've got to say that it is a big commitment um as as as a council law it's a challenge and you need to be good at organizing your time and also your other skills there are you know the council meetings have big papers they're they're large agendas uh and you really your ability to manage your often work life as well as uh managing the council is is a challenge uh an understanding of strategic planning financial management governance requirements for local government and also strong leadership qualities now we put this together I suppose as a a toolkit of potential capabilities that council council laws might get a bit worried about some of these things to say that we're here to help you so if you are elected as a council law we have a significant induction program a whole lot of training planned a whole lot of support planned for the council laws to provide you that training we provide you that support and advice to enable you to be really effective in your role uh move on to the next slide please for me so the the um local government new south wales uh is the peak body for councils in new south wales uh its president is linda scott who's the councillor from the city of sydney uh and local government new south wales has a board of council laws which oversight oversees its policy and strategy and it actually sets out a capability framework uh and that local government capability framework sets out what the um what lg sw believes is the essential knowledge skills and capabilities to work effectively as a council law and the mayor I'm not going to go through these in detail but I just think that's a really good list of the sorts of capabilities that council laws can have now again you're not expected to have all of these from day one but what we'll do is we'll actually support those council laws that are elected to develop their own training plan and capability improvement plan so we can support you to be as effective as you possibly can be in the role next slide please so some of the examples you can see here on the screen where what they've done is they've actually pulled apart all the potential capabilities for a council or uh and the mayor and I've identified the real key ones that they believe or the core capabilities they believe the council law needs or a successful council that would exhibit as well as a successful mayor next slide please okay the time commitment I think right here I'm going to hand over to mr torreira so matthew torreira would you mind taking over from here yep thank you ben um so this next slide is I guess really from having worked in a number of councils prior to being at woollendilly so it's just my perspective of of what I've seen and getting to know many councillors over the years about what the what's actually involved you know what type of time are we actually talking about here um so the best way of answering it um is this so um for me um the core things that counselors do in a month so at woolander we have two briefings um one community forum and one formal council meeting per month and as ben said before with those type of uh forums that I've just mentioned there's a lot of reading involved with that and if anyone's seen some of our business papers we know that they can sometimes be very chunky and there's lots of material and information to digest in terms of other functions that you might be doing within the month there are many hours I guess really at your discretion about how much more time you want to put in and there could be a range of informal residence contacting you via telephone letter email and sometimes that might not necessarily be during a reasonable hour some of our councils get phone calls and emails at all sorts of crazy hours of the day um you may also be asked and obviously not during the covert period but you may also be visiting residents in their homes or public spaces to be having I guess meetings with them about particular concerns they have in the community if you do decide to take on I guess a more of an advanced role as an elected councillor there are opportunities there to chair special interest reference groups and obviously if you decide to do that there's the time commitment is um obviously a bit more we have a variety of different functions and events on at council throughout the year and these events are generally voluntary for councillors if they choose to attend them it's completely up to their discretion but counsellors are all invited to attend various events and other forums that we have throughout the year look if you ask me the question about how how counsellor I would say it's probably around between say 10 to 20 hours a week depending on obviously the commitment that you would like to apply to the role and I would say it's it's a lot more time if you are the poppy elected mayor um the mayor has um has been said in the in his previous slide there there's a number of other additional responsibilities for the mayor um a councillor um being elected as a council is a commitment in this term it's a three-year commitment due to covert um the the term slightly shortened um but it is I guess a significant commitment to be putting a hand up and to also be elected as a counsellor the good news is is that many of our counsellors have been able to balance the hectic life of being a counsellor with their full-time jobs and also the family and caring responsibilities so the good news is is that it is certainly doable and whilst it is challenging it is very very rewarding to see the the great outcomes that you can on before about there's about the support that we provide and um not only do we have a dedicated corporate governance team that provide a lot of support to our counsellors but we also have a number of other frameworks in place to provide you with all the tools and the abilities to juggle all the the hecticness of life and all the challenges that the role of the counselor does bring ben mentioned about prioritizing your time that's obviously a key skill and a key little trick for the role about trying to to balance everything but I mean ultimately I feel the the rewards of helping people and making a difference in the community I feel is is very much well worth the the commitment and the time commitment that you're going to give over the next three years if we can just go to the next slide please so this next slide is about the the council of support that's available um so um in terms of what a counselor receives once they're elected they receive a monthly electoral allowance and that counsellor um I know you guys are all doing it for the love but um being realistic as well in this day today there's there's obviously lots of things that um that need to be spent and um your time and commitment is is valued and I guess that's why that allowance is there um there's a dedicated um training and conference budget for counsellors as well and that's to help you with your ongoing learning and development as a counselor we provide the tools of the trade as well to councillors we provide phone computers laptops and internet access there's reasonable reimbursement for accommodation meals and expenses that's all your out-of-pocket it's expenses as well and we have a policy around that carer responsibilities um there is a carers expense as well whilst performing uh the council duties the state government recently has introduced as well from july 2022 superannuation for councillors which is a new thing for new south wales councillors there's a few other jurisdictions around australia have got that for councillors but that's a fairly um from july next year it's part of the corporate governance team we also have an executive assistant to mayor and councillors uh christie who is actually part of the audience tonight and christie's a fairly new role um that we've appointed at council and and she provides that dedicated administrative and executive support to our councillors and the mayor next slide please so professional development and our induction program um so it's not I guess the case when you're elected that we simply say to you okay you've thrown in a deep end now go for it it's far from that we have a an intensive induction program which goes over the space of three weeks at the beginning of when the new council starts and that induction program is I guess a variety of different things it's if I can theme it it really comes down to I guess the the nuts and bolts of being a council it looks at things such as how you can make the best decisions as being a counsellor it gives you information about all I guess a very very small high level information from each of our directors here tonight but we give you all the information and and hopefully teach you the ropes about the different areas of council and what we do we have the ability to set up a ongoing professional development plan for councillors and as I said before we have a dedicated training budget where if you identify that there are you know certain gaps that you have or if there's certain things that you would like to learn more about we can um provide a training program for you and also through the assistance of our peak body local government new south wales there's a variety of other council or training and networking opportunities there for you as well our counselor induction program isn't simply a three week and that's it it's really I guess a rolling program for the three years so we take the opportunity at some of our briefings throughout the term to really give our guests our counselors all the information that they need and also to get them them to make the best possible decisions at the council meetings itself the office of local government is very much focusing on council laws and their professional development so there's actually quite a robust framework now around council law learning and development it's an expectation of the role of a counselor that it's about continuing learning so it features very heavily as part of our ongoing program for our new councillors as the slide said you're not expected to know everything on day one and we're here to help you and we're here to set you up for the best possible opportunities for success to deliver for our community next slide please so what this is about is really I guess I've mentioned a lot tonight about frameworks and legal responsibilities this is just a slide just to let councillors know that it can be I guess a bit of a legal minefield when it comes to understanding what your legal responsibilities and ethical responsibilities are as a counsellor there's lots of pieces of legislation and some of them are just cited here to help you and to help councillors understand what their obligations are and to navigate through that minefield although there is lots there it's certainly not something that you can't navigate through with our help and it's really these frameworks are in place to ensure I guess the transparency and accountability of the local arm of council to our community but don't be overwhelmed by that we are certainly here to assist you navigate through all those pieces of legislation next slide please um this is just some information here from the new south wales electoral commission so the new south wales electoral commission is running the local government election and they're the first point of call for any information about eligibility to nominate we've got some details at the end of the presentation about how you can contact the electoral commission if you have any I guess questions about that but this slide just gives you a bit of a I guess an overview about are you eligible to nominate and put your hand up to be considered as a council law the first point of call for any queries around that next slide please here's some important dates again this is all on the new south wales electoral commission website so you don't have to write all this down we'll be sending out a copy of the presentation to you after the session this evening so it just really is a summary of some of the key timelines so the nomination period for people wishing to be considered for election is on the 26th of july and that then starts what's called the regulated period and that's really about the advertising and the electoral material which is the start of that period in there there's a candidate handbook available to anyone considering standing for council and that can candidate handbook is on the new south wales electoral commission website and it gives you a lot of information about the the rules and the do's and the don'ts when it comes to electoral material and advertising in there so I would encourage you to go and have a look at that um and then you some key dates and milestones right up to the actual election date itself and as we can see there we've covered as well there's going to obviously be a lot more focus on the electronic voting which the electoral commission has recently announced um and there will obviously be hopefully depending on the covert situation um the the physical voting at the ballot box as well but it's to be determined by the electoral commission there once the election is held there's could be a bit of a period of time before we know who our elected councillors are and the electoral commission make the declaration of the results around the end of september in there and that's when we reach out to the elected council and we all the elected councillors at that point and we bring you on board for the induction now what we do are going to do for anyone that wants the information on the what the proposed induction program looks like the governance team can send copies out to anyone who wishes to have a look at that I guess what the induction program looks like for the first three weeks so it's certainly some interesting reading and gives you a good perspective of the time commitment that you'll have to put aside if you are elected to participate in the first part of the induction process next slide some key contacts in there as well which I've already made reference to next slide please and here's just some links there electoral commission is one that I would suggest um you have to take a look at and the candidate handbook in there um and there's some other information there as well along with that as well such as our website and office of local government thank you ben over to you christoph thank you matt um so um for everyone who's thankfully joined us today uh we've bombarded you with a whole lot of information um we've tried to keep it relatively short there's obviously a whole lot more detail behind what council does and we're very happy to share any of that information you would like you're interested in coming in and having a chat um in the covered world we'll need to do that over zoom or over teams but I'm very happy to do so you just need to get in contact with my uh executive assistant deb hunt um her contact details are on the website so if you look on on council's website under the election page you'll find the contact details there so um here we are at the end so we're going now into the q a session what I might ask the hostess to do if you don't mind is turn the presentation off and then also put the um format can you turn the format back to gallery mode perhaps that's possible um so we can see everyone who's in the audience and then if anyone has any questions um please put your hand up um the only person in the audience I can see is michael but if anyone else has any questions please put your hand up and we'll jump in from there otherwise you're chat box it's not quite the same is it it's catching up in person not quite the same don't get to have a cup of tea don't get to sit down have a proper conversation you know we're talking over a screen it's not really the same is it so apologies it's out of our control but hopefully we can at least answer any questions you've got so would anyone like to ask anything if you would like to you could simply take your microphone off mute jump on in and ask away I can't quite hear you is it yeah I think brendan brendan we can't hear you can't_''_4296.96 quite hear brandon I can see we can see your mouth moving try again it's all right we've got time uh what about now yes we've got you yep all right go technology win a prize first question just wondering so we're talking about planning here right with realtor and so uh I know this is getting a bit ahead of myself but so what the council have for getting those things implemented such as police stations and hospitals and things like that so that's obviously beyond council's reach but there's still services that are going to be needed especially when you're talking a hundred thousand people in born dearly and we currently don't have either so good question um tony do you want to jump in and answer that one yeah thanks thanks ben thanks brandon for the question there's a really strong framework around planning for the infrastructure at both state and local level at the local level we have a thing called the development contributions plan and what that does is identify all the infrastructure at the local level so those things that we're responsible for providing and we work towards a sequencing plan so that there's you know reasonable certainty about when those items will be delivered so that might be things like local parks um you know the the a bike trail a community facility a swimming pool or something like that so those are the things that you'd find in website and it's it's okay it's digestible you could have a look at it it's um it's okay to work through at the state level they have special infrastructure contributions and a plan that goes with that so for wilton there's um significant um amounts of infrastructure and I need to just I'll just check the number and I'll put it in the chat in a sec 650 million I think okay thanks thank you ben uh wonderful yeah so there's 650 million dollars worth of state infrastructure that's been identified in the draft sick for wilton um you may be aware that wilton was established as a growth area on the basis of no cost to government now obviously that's a that's an interesting term but what that means in principle is that the developers are required to fund that infrastructure there are major items that of course the state will fund but the developers need to fund this the regional infrastructure that's specifically supporting the wilton growth area now there is also another document which state government on and it's an infrastructure phasing brochure for wilton it's a glossy brochure and it provides indicative infrastructure at both state and local level in five-year grabs it it isn't down to the level of detail say for example it provides force a land for a school but it doesn't actually go through and tell you when the school's going to be built and operational but it gives you a good uh overview of the sort of infrastructure that's planned for wilton it is a huge task to plan for a growth area and it's really important that we get that right and it certainly has been a strong focus of this council and I imagine it will be a very strong focus of the next council as well we've established a pretty close working relationship with the state because that's how we're going to get the best outcomes and we've we've had I think a lot of air time with the state and they've been very open to coming and meeting with our councillors state um council plan estate planners um so look we we don't have all the answers yet but we do know that um that planning framework is firmly in place and a funding source is part of that planning as well so um just to add to that as well brendan um the elected council has the ability also to advocate to lobby um directly to ministers to um to other other levels of government as well so for example actually last night council met council last night approved a um or resolved to write to the government to ask for the population trigger points as to when some of that infrastructure would be delivered and then what that means effectively if we write a letter yes but then um myself tony tony's team also work with the government agencies to bring forward that that infrastructure investment so if you're talking about fire stations so as part of the development there is land for a fire station and and plans for that on-site police station I can't remember exactly um so I suppose there's a in the state infrastructure contribution and delivered that way otherwise there is uh an opportunity for council to work with the state government with the federal government and lobby to see that sort of thing delivered so I might just I might just add just one more that uh to that um ben if I may um there is also another mechanism whereby infrastructure is delivered and it's through a thing called a planning agreement it usually has the word voluntary planning agreement at the front of that and so that's where the uh the developers um enter into an agreement with the council or with the state government to bring forward some of that infrastructure so they will then fund that infrastructure and they will deliver that infrastructure or pay a contribution towards it towards its delivery so that's another mean means whereby infrastructure can be delivered there have been a lot of changes over the last few months through the contributions framework and we're still working through what those changes will mean for council but it is designed to ensure that it's a fair and it delivers what communities need if I might be able to add to ben if that's okay one thing that we do do uh on the ground is we do a lot of studies a lot of gathering of evidence and data and through our engagement processes with the local community brendan and getting that feedback so we can ground truth what's actually happening at a local level for state and federal government to understand what the issues are and what the needs are and we bring that back to council in the form of our council reports and briefing sessions which also helps add to the advocacy role that we have so we're able to provide an evidence-based argument and also advocacy approach to what the needs are for all in delhi we also have partnerships in place with other councils and we can advocate on a regional level for what's needed regionally as well to ensure that wallanderi is not forgotten on a regional basis as well thanks ali does that address your question brendan uh yeah I didn't mean to just it was more was um it was more you know what I mean so effectively we don't have to really offer it but it's more that was my next question what you're saying is you know so when do you decide these services are going to go in because hospitals don't go up overnight you know what I mean and neither do police stations they take time so you know what I mean so off the top of my head I worked out if we're going to what uh 108 000 by 2036 that's 3 600 people per year on average uh you know so when when do you decide okay this is this this is the marker you know but you've obviously addressed that as well and like I said I'm probably just getting ahead of myself so yeah just just curious not at all brendan in fact um it's something that all of the community should have an interest in because all the community will benefit from those new services and facilities and in terms of hospitals we state government but we haven't given up on that and we're continuing to advocate to the state for a hospital there were two parliamentary inquiries last year into hospital services or medical services in the southwest of sydney and also at regional remote and rural medical services and facilities and they both highlighted the gap and we knew we've made submissions in fact ali appeared at uh at the inquiry um and made her her point on behalf of wallindilly that we needed the state to start thinking about a hospital out this way so we'll continue to advocate for that and as the population grows then we grow more evidence towards that demand yeah like I said the main concern was how do we address things obviously beyond our control you know what I mean for what you're saying there it's you know rates and rubbish but it's like it's there's so much more to a community than just rates and rubbish you know what I mean rates roads and rubbish um so yeah but no yeah thanks for that other questions um from any of our attendees tonight I'm sorry to say I can't see you all so if you do want to raise your question please take your microphone off and jump on in okay I might just pause for a second longer if not then obviously we've provided you a huge amount of information tonight what I might let you do is digest it have a think about it you're welcome to come back to us as always with any questions on any of the issues we've raised tonight as matt said we'll make sure that the presentation given this evening is circulated um to all the attendees um I understand there are a number of people as well who couldn't make it tonight who we provided with the recording um of the session too so if you guys have any questions um you're welcome to send them in to us as well and as I said earlier um you're welcome to contact my ae my ea if you'd like to make a time to come and priorities are and any further questions you have about the operations of council and the role of a council law if you have any questions probably the best thing to do is to email them directly as well to governance at wallindelli.nsw and we'll endeavor to get back to you as quickly as you can so um before we wrap up um just want to check once more that there's no further questions no brendan wins a prize great work man thank you well thank you very much everyone then for coming along we might wrap it up early tonight I'll give you back

Hi welcome to the first wrap-up of councils meeting from last night last night we covered a whole range of issues one of the things we talked about with the voluntary planning agreement for 55 to 57 min ago Street picton we've reaffirmed our position on the Wilton Newtown at this point in time we haven't received any correspondence back from the Minister for planning or from the premier council will also fund 36 community grant applications this is really exciting because the little bit of money that we give them gets expanded out and it accomplishes a whole lot of things for our community the minutes of the traffic committee rx were accepted and they also included a road closure for a cycling event that's going to be exciting in October the Razorback Mountain Hill Climb some of the notices motions that we talked about were the threat of the dam wall raising at were a gamba this threatens a lot of our indigenous art up in the borough Green Valley we also looked at the role of animal charities and their role in rescuing animals and the possibility of cat feral cat trapping how to minimize wildlife strikes on our area and we had a visit from wires who had a very special little bundle of a little Joey that had been rescued we are seeking community consultation with the Department of Transport yet again about the outer Sydney orbital because they haven't actually come to all Italy and discussed with any of our residents to find out more of these issues the minutes will go up on councils website later this week and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact council thank you
Um before we formally kick off today I'd also like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land of which we meet today um actually the many lands on which we meet today and pay my respects to elders past present and emerging so um to kick off um I'm actually going to hand over to tony so tony over is our director of planning here at council um and also a very experienced obviously um female leader from across the sector but worked in new south wales in queensland many many different local governments that brings a lot of experience so tony's going to host today so tony over to you thanks very much ben uh appreciate that uh that introduction and welcome um so look first of all I'll just uh would like to let you know about the format for today and introduce the panel members so we're we're going to have a series of um present we're going to have a presentation to start with just to provide some background um about being in council running for local government that and we also wanted to provide some information about well and delicious and then we'll move into a short break and we'll come back to questions and answers and we have our panel members um available to help us um provide you with some background from their personal experiences in local government so I think we can go to what's the next slide ladies oh okay um what I'm going to do is first of all I'll come back and I'll introduce the panel members and then I will hand over to councillor hannan who will um introduce the australian local government women's association and uh and thank them for their involvement today so first of all as ben said I'm tony abre and I'm just going to be hosting the session today and I really want to thank the ceo for coming along and and supporting women in local government I think it's really important that leadership at all levels and of all genders both genders actually support women in local government it can't just be women I i would like to uh welcome councillor judith hannan to the panel today um councillor hennan has been with uh wallendilly council for a very long time I think it's 20 years 17 years and she brings a wealth of experience and she'll be sharing that experience with you all a bit later on and I'd also like to welcome on the screen um councillor tina ayett and council ayyad is joining us kindly joining us online um she's joined us as a counsellor from liverpool council and we really appreciate her being here today councillor hannah is the only female counsellor we have at wallendilly so we've had to reach out and we really appreciate council age making herself available today she actually has three young children at home this morning so we all know what it's like to balance those requirements on a busy saturday morning so thank you very much councillor ayud and we look forward to hearing hearing from you a bit later on about your experiences in local government as well and over on my left I have as an officer for some 17 18 years and so she also has a wealth of experience particularly as a great knowledge about wallandale shire so we'll be inviting ali to share some of that she's worked with many counsellors male and female counsellors over the years and can also bring that experience into the discussion a bit later on so thanks um thanks for that what we might do is move to the next slide and I'd like to hand over to councillor hannan to to give you a bit of background to algwa and to introduce the alboe representative who was here with us today good morning everyone so when I first joined council I was unaware of any particular support for women until we had a little women's issue in council and I looked out to see what support I could get and came up with this amazing group of women called alvarez so it's australian local government women's association today we're really lucky we've got bev spearpoint here who was on the board for many years of the are you a life member yes a life member of algwah they're really an interesting group of women they range from councillors and staff mayors deputy mayors all sorts of women across the whole sector and they run some interesting conferences and they're different sorts of conferences to what you will get in the general area um but the conferences I believe are actually better for everyone male or female because they give you real stuff that you can actually incorporate into your life at council um so they they take an active role and they've developed a lot of presentations to try and encourage women to actually run for council because we're 51 of the population and that's what we should have around the table because council it's as close as you can get to our families and women should be perhaps even in the in the majority in that area so welcome but our is something and you can actually contact them even if you're interested in running for council to see what information they have for you thanks very much here and that we're able to have this the association support in running this session um as councillor hendon said women are 51 of the population we have one female councillor councillors really need to be representative of their whole community and therefore we need more women on council and in fact more women in government at all levels so that's uh that's a it's a great initiative thank you we might just move on to the next slide and I just want to give you a little bit of a history of voluntary a little bit of an overview uh those of you who are wallendale residents probably know all this but it's always helpful to just recap it and it's um it's it's it's important to acknowledge the fabulous history that uh we have in wallindilli and the values and um the attributes that we value in well in dilly the council was first established in 1906 but interestingly it didn't include picton until 1940 maybe a lot of people don't know that I certainly didn't it was amalgamated in 1940 so that's the the council um that we have today um the the size of the shire is is is quite remarkable too when you compare it with some of our neighboring councils it's 2560 square kilometers so it's a huge area it has a lot of natural beauty which we're very particular about protecting the um the shire is home to sydney's sydney's um uh water catchment essentially we hold um we have the waragamba and cataract dams we obviously have uh wonderful rivers and creeks and streams and they're all part of that important water catchment for sydney we've got an important role to play in protecting protecting those water services and storage areas for the whole of greater sydney and protecting the fabulous environment in which we live protecting koala habitat and protecting the cumberland plain woodland areas that we have within the shire at the same time we're growing and it's a challenging balancing act to ensure that we can have growth while still protecting all that makes wallendilly special forward council's role in the communities to represent the whole of the community and I think that's something that um may be discussed later on particularly from our representatives on the panel the role of a council area is important because you're so close to the council you're close to the community local government is the closest level of government to the community and it has an influence on day-to-day life in in terms of what happens with residents every day of their lives much more so than other levels of government and sometimes it's underrated but I think it's really important that we highlight exactly what local government does sometimes very seamlessly and and invisibly the role the voluntary council has a um a series of five key themes which defines how we deliver services all councils are required in local government to work within a a corporate planning framework which sets out our objectives and responsibilities out and it's in a framework around the community so key to that is is a process and document called the community strategic plan and council because we're going to be starting to refresh and renew that community strategic plan early in this term that community strategic plan influences our delivery program and our annual operational plan and budget and I won't go too much into that there will be a lot more information about that at our next candidate information session which will be running on a weeknight and will be encouraging all candidates male and female to consider coming along to that and there'll be a lot more detailed information we really wanted to focus today on the role of female counsellors can you move on to the next slide please so just a little bit more about wallindilly the current population as of the 2020 census is 54 000 it's growing significantly we expect to double our population by 2036 and that's largely around our major growth area which is wilton we're also investing in supporting our 15 towns and villages and in the first instance our focus is on picton we are looking at place planning for other towns and villages but at the moment picton and it's incredibly exciting again as newly elected councillors you would be involved in that process we're planning for a new performing arts center on the corner of coldhand street and banangle street we're refurbishing and upgrading the shire hall while preserving all of its heritage and history and that will be the home of the councilors that will be where the changes are located um back in in their home which I think is really exciting again it's something that newly elected councillors will will be able to look forward to the other big part of that project the performing arts centre is also going to have community space and we're looking at a new library facility gallery and community meeting spaces we're also building a new government services building which will be the home of the administration centre for council this is incredibly exciting and it is about transforming victim and we're not forgetting about the rest of the picton area because we're undertaking a major place planning process which will set the vision for the future of picton by private and government sector areas and bringing more people into this town centre and providing more things to do more activities more business opportunities and somewhere to meet somewhere to be entertained and somewhere for families and I think important to note in that key to that is the uh the essentially it's uh the town square which will be a green space for meetings and gatherings I might just mention the local strategic planning statement which is a document called wallendilly2040 a lot of information today but just to note this sets our vision for planning land use planning this is what we build what we support in the shire and it has a wonderful vision statement which is captured on that screen and it is about trying to blend the balance of supporting the new growth and the opportunities that that brings while at the same time protecting all that makes swollen dewy special and that's the historic villages the modern living rural lands and bush it's an exciting time to be joining council what I might do now is hand over to ali counsellors and give you a bit more information about the governance framework around being on council thanks tony yes thanks welcome everybody and those online welcome everyone here in the gallery it's really really exciting to see so many women here this morning interested in running as a candidate for dilly my role here I'm actually executive director for community and corporate and have been in this role now for oh since 2009 so it's quite up quite a while working in the executive level um and that's something that we've been striving for all through our goal is to get more women voted not only in council as a councillor but also in some of the senior roles within council so very grateful and privileged to to be in israel alongside tony on the executive council of responsibilities is what I wanted to have a little chat about this morning we often wonder why we don't we have more women running in the roles of councils sometimes it seems to be very overwhelming and and look as though it's a difficult role and a wonderful experience to be able to take on board and those responsibilities are supported by a whole framework and a whole network of support to enable you to be able to do your job and your role as as efficiently effectively and also as fulfilling as possible so community advocacy representation is one of the biggest part of the role passion being passionate about your community passionate about what the needs are looking at how we can advance things in the area and also too how can we maintain and keep a hold of our history our culture and with that growth that's coming that tony was talking about so the role essentially is about how you advocate for your community how you advocate for what the needs are in the area and being this as we've said this morning the closest level of government to people it's it's a really really important role you're there to have a say and you're there to represent the views particularly of those that don't have a voice so you become that voice for's a strategy so when we talk about strategy and strategic policy it's about the vision it's about where we want to head what we want to do what we need to focus on what are the key areas that we need to be looking at wallindilly does have a very big history of rural living of being an agricultural community but it's also always a hidden gem it's not been one of those areas that's up on the spotlights like the highlands or the mountains or or the hawkesbury it's one of those little hidden gems and and I think that's been one of the secrets of us being able to continue and maintain some about the cultural uh history of the area but the strategic policy development with growth we're looking at how we're going to balance how we're going to grow because for us to be able to develop the infrastructure that's needed we have to grow there's got to be a certain element of growth but how do we then balance that to maintain's a strategic policy overview which has been discussed through community strategic plan now the community strategic plan is the whole community's plan it's not council's plan council has a role in which to develop that plan and our delivery program is our response as council of what we're going to do but as a councillor the role is to advocate for that plan for other levels of government other agencies and other people to help implement what that community strategic vision and view is so as a counsellor you have oversight of that strategic plan and the delivery program and also looking at our operational plan a delivery program is a four year view and our operational plan is up one new view it's virtually about the budget it's about how we're going to spend the dollars where we're going to pop um how we're going to focus on those key areas looking at where we're going to get dollars from um so the operational plan sets out how we're going to get income and also then how in line with what the community's needs and views are the other role is around service delivery priorities what's the focus one of the one of the biggest areas that challenges that we've we've faced a lot is in our roads while in delhi has over 890 kilometers of road in which to to maintain to rebuild to look after but also and amongst that mixed we have other obligations a library children's services waste collection our garbage that's one of the main roles for council looking at how how we're going to be providing planning services how are we looking after the land and environmental services so yes the roads are a main focus because we have poor public transport uh it's the way in which we travel the way in which we connect and it's really important but it's also important to remember the other types of services that council is responsible for delivering as well and that can become a bit of a challenge when you're looking at how you disperse the dollars that you've a team and looking at how we can meet the needs and how we can can provide for the community so it's around funding allocation projects council applies for grant funding external from state government and federal government and also to from other areas such as we're a mining community so there is grants available through different types of like resources for region programs of where we can actually add to the budget to get people's needs met we consult regularly with community organizations number case holders around decision making so as a role of the council you'll have a leadership role on how we engage how we run our forums in the decision making ultimately the way in which decisions are made it is as a team nine councillors led by a mayor we'll we'll be uh every every month have a meeting to discuss those decisions and you'll be a a part of that decision making so there's quite a lot of responsibilities there but there's lots of support in place to help as council officers we're here questions um and one of the biggest roles and responsibilities of the council is to be asking those questions and asking what it is what it is we need to to to be looking at and if you're not sure we're here to give you that support so a bit of a toolkit here for perennial role as a counselor passion passion for social justice and your community is is is is could be the essence of the role of a council because it's about the community good communication and personal skills it's about the ability to be able to listen learn how you advocate negotiate and mediate and we can also help any potential new counselors uh in in in helping you to develop those skills don't feel as though you have to be perfect you don't have to have all those skills refined ready for you to jump in it's about your journey and about how you support the community and we're here to support you in that role and we can help provide training with information to assist you strategic thinking is about the big vision and where we're heading and how and where we're going to um council offices implement the operational side of um of the business because it is a big business run council um and the council's role is about the strategy and the big thinking where we want to go what we want to do how we're going to get there uh is part of that big strategic thing so it's about uh thinking outside the square and how do we solve some of the issues and some of the problems that we have in the community but it's also looking at opportunities and we're here as council officers to assist you in that role good organisation and time management well I don't know who else would have good organisation and time management skills I think as women we are constantly juggling constantly looking at running the household and working at the same time the organizational skills and time management is something I think a lot of women have wonderful skills in um but again we to assist you with that such as um we've got lots of systems within council we can provide you with equipment computers phones all that sort of things are provided for council in your role to enable you to manage your time and organisational skills as much as possible I've already talked about a good understanding of strategic planning and financial management um there is lots of governance there's lots of rules and regulations within councils a lot of people think oh this red tape what's it all there for at the end of the day a lot of that is there to help protect you as a counselor in your decision making and also protect the residents as well there's got to be a framework there's got to be a structure from which we actually make our decisions and implement decisions because that enables fair and equitable distribution of resourcing and also to it enables a framework for um for when things go wrong that you're protected so but there is a whole system in place around decision making to assist you up front you don't have to be an expert in that particular area we have a government section within council that can help explain we have policies procedures in place that we we are trying uh to make as plain english as possible for people to understand um we also have access for you to legal advice and legal support in assisting you in any decision making or understanding I think one of the biggest parts in this particular area which prevents a lot of women from running as a counselor is thinking that you need to know everything and you need to know what all those rules and everything are you don't you just need to know what questions to ask and not be afraid to ask questions and because the question you don't ask what was the silly question it's very important to to ensure that uh you keep an open mindset and and not not to worry about what questions to ask um because we're here to support and here to provide all those resources for you uh the one of the that we can assist you is in your leadership around uh confidence energy enthusiasm really that's all you need uh honesty resilience and of course humor is a really good part of um becoming part of a greater team so they're just some of the things that maybe we'll talk about when we're on the panel as to what why it sometimes can prevent women from wanting to run as a counselor when really there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to because there's so many supports in place now to enable women to be able to to take up the role of counsel plus also to continue in whatever role you want to do whether you're working full-time caring working as a volunteer in the community we're here to help support you in doing that as well so yeah cool so that's some of the um some of the the the toolkits that we've got and supports we've got in place thanks ali I think um I think that's a great overview of of the only in um in terms of um our democratic system in terms of running for office uh but or even in in terms of applying for positions um qualified positions we often find that women I suppose they underrate themselves they don't see themselves as competitive as their male colleagues and we really want to turn that around we want to turn that around in terms of the positions that we advertise for staff here at council and certainly we want to turn that around in terms of women putting themselves forward to run for council I really like the image that's on the next slide because I think it it sums up some of what ali was saying there and certainly what um our councillors hannan and councillor ayud can attest to when we get to the panel discussion I want to ask them about that in particular but I know that they've both had experience juggling children oh that's quite awesome it's all right I just went off for a second thank you okay we're back my technical issue yes I know husbands outside interests whether that's jobs or volunteer organizations or or any other commitments as well as being a counsellor and so I think it'll be useful to draw on that because I know that's sometimes something that may help women back from putting themselves forward but you know there we have the uh the young mum maybe she's a counsellor and she's juggling her children and her ipad and her family commitments and certainly councillor ayat is doing that today and we really appreciate her um putting the time in to be with us so there is a lot of support available so ali has gone through a lot of that but this is some of the uh the more formal support that's uh available to councillors there is an allowance we won't go through the detail of that today there's obviously going to be training and induction sessions for our our newly elected council you will have tools of the trade be it an ipad or a laptop or telephone access to internet support with training our wonderful it officers us and making all this happen um we have a great help desk and everything is digital and we certainly will support any councillors in um in working through those um new tools if they're not familiar with them the there's also other provisions around reinvestment for other expenses that may arise we do provide the opportunity for training that's covered by council as well there's carers expenses available while performing council duties from july next year there will be superannuation for councillors and there is a newly appointed position that hasn't yet started but she'll be starting in the next couple of weeks I believe and we've got a dedicated executive assistant for the mayor and councillors and that's part of our commitment to growing our organisation to meet the growing needs of our shire and we're really excited about that role because it's going to provide a much higher level of support to our councillors thank you lexi so this is just a a diagram here about the government framework just to give an understanding that um there the federal government state government and also local councils so just to sort of give a little bit of an overview of what the actual levels of responsibility are so federal government they're matters that they deal with the things such as medicare defense immigration and foreign policy so that's that's in the realm of federal government that's their responsibility to ensure programs and resourcing and and everything's in place for those particular areas when it comes to state state government but yet there are there's a little sometimes a bit of an overlap between local government and state government but the roles in state government are things around such as roads and that's I'm talking major roads state roads like highways and and major state roads housing in prisons things like public transport is is the role uh police ambulance services education services hospitals health services so that's the realm and the role of state government to provide local government is very much around I suppose you could call us really more so local administration for the state government in policies so local government is responsible for the on the ground towning town planning matters looking at place space so looking at areas around the wallander local government area so things like happen and how how that townships to be shaped as tony said picton and main hearts or center of voluntary's depicted film in tarmor areas so council's role is looking at land use issues at a local level there we also some councils are responsible for sewage this area we're not some councils are responsible for their water we're not in wall and deli okay so sydney water it is a state responsibility the sewerage is so that's where there's some sort of overlap and misunderstanding could be sometimes from people in the community about what council should be delivering or could be delivering we look after local roads and we also look after the rubbish collection a local government historically erodes rates and rubbish is really has historically been the core essence of what local government does that however has increased over the years where it is a lot of around right to the bridge where we we have library services we have children's services we have services with our animal shelter and looking after how we maintain our companion animals act is the responsibility of local government so when um you're out there campaigning and someone says right we want a hospital and you we want you as a candidate to get us a hospital that's something that council can't actually physically deliver we don't have the budget for it it's not really our responsibility however it's our role to advocate for the community and that's where we look at that strategic view and overview of how come how can we get those those issues into our community strategic plan so as we can advocate for that on behalf of the community to state and federal government it's like public transport our role is to look at a lot of our connections and connectivity issues um digital is a very big issue now that's becoming uh like a piece of public plumbing I suppose you could say digital is now our role to actually provide digital services again that's a federal government um issue but it's our role to advocate for that so it's it's done just to understand what how the three levels of government work together and how we working a collaborative partnership to do that so I'm just just bringing this issue up because if you're out there campaigning um or out there wanting to support the community be very careful not to make too many promises that you might be able to keep um it will make your role really difficult if you are successful on counselling in delivering those promises so it's good to get a good understanding and again we're here as council officers to help assist you in the understanding of the systems our roles and what we're able to do from there so thank you yeah that's great that's a great overview because I i know that many members of the community are a bit confused about who's responsible for what in terms of government services we usually get blamed's good to remind the community who's responsible for what but we're very happy to advocate to the right level of government if there's a problem we might just just quickly go through this one um I'll just jump back to that if I can this is a really important year again I said it was a great time to be running for council it's a really important year for a number of reasons so you might be aware that we actually had the last term of council extended by a year because of the covent scenario so the last term of council was five years it is a normal four-year term but it was five years this last term the next term of council will only be three years because it's going to be brought back into alignment with the normal four-year term so that's an exciting change so you you know run for council you've got three years it's a good introduction to see if it's really something you want to do it's also a big year're going to have a popularly elected mayor in the past the mayor has been selected by the councillors this year the community is going to select the mayor and it's the first time for wallindilly it's a huge step forward and I think it marks another part of our journey in in terms of growth we are moving from a a rural council we're still defined as peri urban because we're just outside the major urban centre but we're moving from a rural council to a growth council and part of that means that we've got to ramp up our capacity to plan for that growth and deliver for that those future communities and having a popularly elected mayor is part of our maturity journey I think it's also another there's also another change happening whereby council's um distribution of councillors is going from three wards which is where councillors are allocated to different areas of the shire to two wards and that's another change um it it's it probably moves councillors to uh to be um looking sure for some councillors it may um it may not be their preference because they feel very closely connected to their community my personal view is that that's still very possible we we can still have counsellors who are very connected to their to their particular town or village among our 15 towns or villages but they're also taking a whole of shy view and looking after the whole community so it's it's part of the change as well um the this screen there just gives you a framework for um you to determine if you're eligible and and they're they're not onerous requirements um I think most of us in this room are over 18. so that's a tick and and the the others are um our normal requirements for for office within within australia it's it's interesting the third god point there too we we've in the past had counsellors or actually had some some women who wanted to to run but thought they couldn't because they weren't a resident of holland but they're councillors who who aren't residents but actually have significant connection to the to the area that still makes you eligible to run as a counselor yeah good point good point absolutely we've got one more slide before morning tea I believe and this is just some key dates um it's a busy slide so um I'd urge you to get a copy of that from the um the handouts in the back of the room for those uh those people are here with us today and certainly we can distribute these to any of our online online viewers today so important to note all of those dates um probably the the dates around closing and candidate nominations the 4th of august at 12 p.m so if you're interested in in running don't forget to um to get your nomination before that date we then go into what's called a caretaker period here at council and what that means is that council is on the business of council continues but we're unable to enter into into any uh major financial obligations um for decision as part of that strategic and policy setting role of council and if we don't have elected councils operating at that time then clearly we can't make those commitments so that's an important one we'll keep the wheels turning but we won't be entering into major financial commitments um there's some other dates there around postal votes and so on if you're if you're voting the the election day is the 4th of september big day and the results will be declared progressively after the 7th of september we may not have a decision straight away and we'll obviously need to um respond to that as it unfolds but they're important dates to note thanks lexi I think that was the last line before morning team it is so look thanks everyone for listening that's probably the the most that we're going to do talking at you what we're going to do after a 15-minute break is invite um our panel members to tell us about their experiences and that'll include the ceo um mr minutes thank you here we are we all know we're all notice everyone and we'll just see if council aide is available to join us again here we go sorry I just I just missed that when you reconvened I was just downstairs with the little one that's all right thank you very much uh councillor ayad we really appreciate you being here because I think that what you're experiencing now is really important to um for us to explore a little bit more because we know that um women have lots of commitments and it's so important to be able to juggle all of those and we think that you've got lots of experience to draw on with what you're uh managing at the moment and obviously council hennan has too with what she's managed over her career so look we we're going to have questions and answers uh in this session now there won't be any more of us talking at you we're really keen to have a much more interactive session now we have um invited they have in a question box at the back of the room um so I'm not sure if we have any questions we'll ask the girls here to um to check for us and we'll also uh just to remind those people online that if you have any questions you'd like us to ask the panel members please send them through and the um the officers here will pass them on so we can have your questions answered too so thank you for that can we um and so yes certainly thank you uh thank you bev for asking that question we'll also hand over to the floor and uh invite questions from the floor um the written questions were really if people would prefer not to um not to speak on this this um webcast at the moment so thank you for that um so look I might just just start by asking both counsellor henan and councillor ayad about their experiences and we thought that a question that might be helpful is to uh start with councillor hannah and then we'll go week look like in the life of the councillor from your experience so we can vary you can have a very busy week or you can have a week with not too much on but every tuesday night I know that I'm going to be in council whether it's for a council briefing for a council community forum or for a council meeting and some of that comes obviously with reading the business paper and it does take a little bit of getting used to the business paper but in no time flat all of you will be able to do that um I still work as an optometrist so I'm lucky that I locum so I can manage time around any council events that are on in general and um yeah so a week is and lots of phone calls and emails from people a lot of people will tell you that they email or ring a counsellor and they don't get a call back but I feel strongly that if they've contacted you you should you should respond sometimes I can help them advocate between the community and the general manager and the staff to try and help them sort their issues out um I'm also happy to say if anybody wants to follow me around for a day I put the offer out there you're most welcome to come with me for a day it might be to attend a morning tea it might be somebody with a fill issue might be somebody with a planning issue it might be about a master plan somewhere but it's very interesting because it's very very diverse and you learn so much just before I hand over back again I looked around the room and I looked at the things that ali listed as you know things that you should have to be a counsellor and the women that are in this room and online and many of the women in our area already do all of those things you're all active community members you advocate for people um you try and promote business and things like that so you're already doing those things and I see council as family and you've got to get you've got a certain amount of finances you can plan where you're going to go but you know you've got to get food on the table she's on the the children's feet first if everybody might want you know a certain toy and you might not be able to afford them all at the same time but you have to work out how you're going to manage that and that to me is what council is like it's like my family and getting the fairest best outcome for all of us at the end of the day but anybody that wants to follow me around or see what my emails are for a week or phone calls you're most welcome to follow me even for a couple of hours thanks thanks councillor hannah yeah day in the life of a counsellor there's the offer I know that um that the ceo has has also taken on that with some of the staff here and and uh he's uh he's he's been and uh the mowing crew so um it's a it's an excellent way to actually um gain some experience about what it's like on the ground um council ayud we'd really love to hear from you about about uh your what you would say would be your week and and your experiences so so over to you thanks thank you and thank you again for having me um pretty much it's the same as um counselor hannah not second everything she said and usually my work is made of made up of events briefings a lot of advocacy and communication we have a lot of team meetings um so I'm part of the bible team on liverpool city council and we have quite a few meetings so this is my first term on council and although I'm going into my fifth year there's still a lot of winnings so we um like to have the team meetings just so all the counselors are on the same page we're all very well informed because we do have some counselors that have been all lot of the issues that are ongoing for council because there are many issues that are like that namely in a growth area like liverpool um and a lot of emails for myself I don't advertise my phone number because then it would be never-ending um so I find that it's better for me uh just to manage my emails and usually I do emails at a very ridiculous hour usually it's like one am in the morning or six a.m in the morning while I'm still in bed pull the laptop out return emails direct things to relevant managers um and I also find myself just when I'm out and about locally um you know having lunch at a local cafe or just picking up the kids from school that um I'm I'm continuously communicating um when people know you're on council they they like to have a chat they like to let you know what's going on with them they like to bring things to your attention and you know sometimes it's major things that aren't it's it's things that are you know um quite small maybe a pothole um you know and their wheel got damaged so um it really varies which I like very much um because you're not always doing the same thing day in and day out and you meet so many people along the way you meet so many constituents some are extremely supportive some not so much but it is very exciting thank you thank you thank you very much councillor elliot um I might um stay with the councillors for the moment and then come to ben and ali with the next question just to to build on that um what would would each of you say would be the most rewarding experience that you've had that you could share with us as a female counselor in local government so maybe start with you this time councillor ayud and then we'll come to councillor hammond sure thank you um for me I think it'd have to be two major ones um the first one would be seeing things come to fruition and forward after council resolutions it's something that I really love to see and when you see things come to fruition it's lovely and um you know um it could be something as simple as you know helping a smaller community within a larger community um because these things mean so much to these small community organizations and it might be something so simple for council it's just a you know resolution on the floor of council you know majority of hands go up and it's resolved but it's a major deal for um these individuals or these small communities so definitely things coming to fruition and it's nice to see it happen during your term of counsel you know rather than you finishing up and then you know it coming to fruition in another term and that's why I always say that council term is uh too short because sometimes things take years to to finish and to resolve namely in liverpool again because we are a growth area um so it's nice to see that and also I'd have to I'm proud of as as a woman as a mother um as a war as a as a local who's elected to represent my community is that um I became the deputy mayor my second year um after being elected and I was the first liberal female mayor in liverpool so this was a major achievement and um I actually had a lot of support from my fellow counselors uh directors in council and even just um constituents you know and a lot of the support actually came from male constituents it was like good on you you know great good on you for having a go so that's something that's very personal but I think it was an achievement not only for myself but all women and all women who are invo involved in their community and would like to see a change and would like to be involved in local politics thanks thanks councillor that's fantastic I understand that at the time um liverpool was actually leading the way um with a female mayor a female deputy mayor and a female ceo so oh thank you council hennan over to you please well and I agree with the instances of things not being delivered until the next term on that's sometimes frustrating but it's good to see them actually delivered anyway um I'd say to everyone here that there are nothing not one thing usually is one person's effort for me it's about the team it's about having all your counsellors working together and that's how you will actually deliver things much faster and with a much better outcome than if you try and run something individually some of my passions and things that I've really enjoyed over the time are not necessarily the growth areas I've got some particular issues on some of those areas but for me it's about the peripheral areas of our our council and certainly in warrigamba we've got a all abilities playground and I raised some money specifically for that and fought to get that delivered so that was really good to have appen now having its own skate park it was a thing that somebody together and and we delivered a skate park out there embargo there were other people involved but we certainly got the rfs shed re built out there um so sometimes it's about the periphery not necessarily um and it's not necessarily gender-based but it's about everybody working together and you've got to fight for those issues and get other counselors on board to to help you um I enjoyed some of the fundraiser events we've had we've certainly had barn dances we had a car trial and some of that money I actually donated specifically to prostate cancer because I wanted to show that it wasn't about me being a female it was about the entire community and I think you need to have that in your mind all the time I guess personally um one of the things that I can probably take credit for personally is that we joined up with the city deal the sydney the western sydney city deal and during that process um they talked about many of the things and and there were some big councils there campbelltown which are really big councils and they came up with some money for a livability fund um and this livability fund the other councils wanted to divide it up on their population or very many ways that really would have left us with such an insignificant amount and fortunately I had some support from the mayor of fairfield and firstly I said well let's not divide it up on population let's divide that up on land area and nobody was very keen on that you can understand why but at the end of the day whilst other projects yes they're getting more resources from it we actually got an equal share of that livability fund so we got I think it was 17 million dollars from the livability fund which has allowed us to add on and actually start to do some of the kickstand precinct some of the gym equipment and things everywhere else and our counselors as a group decide where that goes but personally I felt really great that we got an equal share and it did take some mediating advocating um to great outcome but the little things when you make somebody happy about you know it might be a pensioner with a driveway that they can't get somebody that hasn't got a phone or a light that's missing some of those things or one time there was a young lady whose father had died and she was really scared that santa wasn't going to find her that christmas and um yeah we got the christmas lights going in that particular area and I got this beautiful little letter back saying I know that santa will find our house this year so that that's probably one of my majors it was city deals western sydney city deal it was a special group that we're in yeah thank you council hendon thank you councillor that's uh that's great I think um the message is from there it's uh it's not just about the big picture decisions of council it's about the small things that mean so much to individuals or individual community groups and council is able to make those things happen important part of the role of the councillor is to be working in that big picture strategic space but also being able to connect on a personal level with your local community and with individuals uh really important skills and so and council staff can help develop um new counsellors in in those areas and make sure they've got the right tools and and the training that they might need to help them um fulfill those roles um what I might do um this time is ask each of the panel members um a question about their experience with with um female leaders and the sorts of qualities that have been brought to the role and and what I might do um counsellors uh hannah and aidan I'll start with ben and ben's um uh had a lot of experience in mobile government as well and I know he's worked with female counselors and I know ali has too and so I'll start with them and then I'll come back to the both of you so um so ben really would like to hear female counselor um and and from your experience um are there any female counselors that that you would particularly um that made a particular impression on you thanks tony um so I suppose we're maybe even take a little bit of a step back um what I i suppose what I love and why I love to support um women taking on leadership roles in local government is because women bring different perspectives uh and having a diversity of opinion around a table in my view is where you get better decisions um so the more that we can have women and men uh in in leadership roles I think that the more we can have robust discussions robust debates and make sure that we take in all sorts of different views before we make those calls um so I think that's you know really one of the really key reasons why we need to make sure we get women in local government as an example uh so uh in my former roles at pitt water we had a um a female mayor and deputy mayor at pitwater long-standing female mayor who was a strong leader for that community but um the one counselor I want to I suppose highlight was actually a young councillor from worringer council um uh it was councillor in law school who's very she was 21 she got on council if I remember correctly I'm probably wrong I think she might have been being younger she was 21 when she got on council and she ran for council with passion enthusiasm and drive she didn't know exactly what local government meant she didn't know about the governance structures or how to get things done but she was there because she wanted to make a difference for her local community very passionate about youth issues very passionate about environmental issues um and what I saw is that well first of all she got herself on council and I'm sure there was a whole lot of things that drove her baddie about local government because it can seem very bureaucratic at times but what she did was that she worked with the other 11 councillors from that council she talked across the line on some big policy changes for that council and as a result council resolved to go down a different path on environmental issues to engage more with young people and all of a sudden that council had a youth council youth advisory council that advised council on on youth issues issues all of a sudden that council was actually taking action on climate change and wanted to be a leader on climate change and a lot of that was driven by this one young female counselor because she brought different thinking different ideas passion and enthusiasm so um you know that's just one example um but I was so impressed with how she engaged and also not how she stood up and said this is the thing we need to do actually what she did is she worked so closely with all the other counselors to get them on board so that when the decision came to council it was an easy decision it wasn't her fighting against council to get her issue done it was her working with council with the ceo with the and really drive change so that was you know a really great experience thanks ben I think um I think what's great about that story is uh is how young that particular counselor was and you know some of her colleagues may have dismissed her as not having life experience not having enough knowledge uh what can she contribute but clearly she's brought that passion and you know some some real values to the role and that's what's made a difference um so it doesn't need experience and it doesn't need it doesn't need you to have all that knowledge in coming into the role uh just some passion and some belief that you can serve your community um so ellie just wondering from your perspective is there something that you know you can share about yeah in your in your career yeah definitely the one thing that has been a constant theme for me that I've seen from successful women counsellors has been the response what I found over time the only thing you can't control a lot of stuff can control is your response to it and how you respond to it and that's what I have seen over the years where the is is thinking outside the square and looking at how to tackle or how to look at an opportunity in something and the way in which it's responded to I've seen many women bullied I've seen many women harassed not only from within their own team or within their own realm but from outside from the community as well um and a lot of the time it's they're things you can't control but it's your response to that that's going to determine how you're viewed and how you're perceived out there which will ultimately uh determine your success in local government um one of my own little experience personal experience tony was when I was appointed to the role um in the senior executive position my title was assistant deputy general manager so I was too I say but everywhere I went I was referred to as the assistant to the general manager and often notes and the response to that was somebody thinking outside the screen at the time a general manager they said we're going to change that and a lot of the time it changes from just your language words you use so my title was changed to deputy general manager not a system and that changed the whole focus and skype and so something something really tiny a little in the response to that changes the whole perspective you'll have things come across with your successful becoming a counselor things come across your desk where you think and you want to just go oh you want to just you know really get stuck into it sometimes it's good to bite your tongue get your information put it in your back pocket get there ready because knowledge is power and knowledge is success so it's so important that if you don't know something you're not aware of something find out about it come and talk to us you can talk to us suspensive talk to your fellow counselors and try and and work together if there it as an opportunity as who else you can get to help mediate to try and build up that one team approach to delivering things because that's where you'll be more successful in doing things together but it's all about getting that knowledge and that information and using your resources wisely to get that knowledge and that information to help make you success and sometimes it's just thinking outside the square and being a little bit innovative and and that's why you do need that different perspective around the table totally agree with being about perspectives and being open-minded we sometimes come into it with a closed mindset when really we need to develop that growth mindset of of being open-minded and listening so as things come to you in a different way I didn't think of it that way and and that's where you can can come to a compromise on a situation or even and something reflect upon the fact that yeah this is a different approach a different way and all of a sudden things move and great outcomes happen important because it will define you thanks thanks sally it reminds me of stephen kirby one of his um he's a management consultant one of his um messages is seat first to understand um don't jump to conclusions don't jump to um decisions seek first to understand yeah thank you thanks tally I might hand over to the the councillors and ask them for their views perhaps um you're able to identify um a female leader that you may have seen as a a model or maybe you've had a mentor I would be really interested in hearing from both of you so um do you want to start counselling thanks I can I can think of two varied people that um for different reasons um certainly people here many of you would remember liz conahan and this did belong to a political party which I I'm independent but liz was somebody that everybody knew no matter whether you were in her side of politics or not you could go to her with your issue and be confident that she would treat you with was everybody knew liz and liz turned up to nearly all functions she could and yeah I can't change smoke like this rest her soul but I'd love that really integrated into her community so that's one and the other one and and I'm sure most of you will agree is the new zealand prime minister jacinta arjun and I've been reading a lot of things that she talks about and the difference is for her and I think this is really important she doesn't look at her political cycle to make decisions on her political cycle for her own agenda she looks at pushing strategies that are going to be long-term strategies for the benefit of her country and I think that's really important in council and I and I agree that some projects don't get delivered but the long-term strategy is really what it should be about it's not about your own personal agenda of some particular thing it's about delivering the best you can for the long term of our community I want in years to come frame that people go oh gosh you guys did a good job to get us where we were I don't want people going oh those people back then um I want to make it this we have we have all the basis for an amazing community and it's about looking in the long term that's great thank you I think um I think most um most of um the women that I talk to also see that jacinda dern is a is a wonderful role model and uh for me it's about her her compassion and her empathy for people um in on the world stage um yeah yeah thank you council henry council are you from your perspective oh I think we're on mutualism just to say we can't hear you oh that's better thank you can you hear me now yes thank you okay great thank you um I'd have to second everything that counselor hannah said certainly um for me three women I think stand out definitely jacinda ardern um the prime minister of new zealand namely um through she showed leadership and responsibility while also being compassionate so I found that to be very important um and also gladys berejikovan um gladys I believe has shown amazing amazing leadership throughout her term namely through covert and I just feel that she can really communicate to the people which I find sometimes politicians aren't the best at doing and she does this wonderfully uh with with a lot of ease someone else that stands out is actually um a senior lady in um a senior woman I should say in the liberal party her name is mary lou mary lou jarvis and she's currently now the president of the women's council um she's very very supportive of all women coming on board she's a very very active member of her community very involved in her community um she's currently on lara council but I do believe she's been on other council councils throughout um throughout australia I think she was once on adelaide council also um she's a very interesting character so she's a mother of two her children are right but she's an amazing amazing example because she's always been so active um she is till today like the amount of emails I get from her she's just so involved with everyone um knows everybody by name has everybody's phone numbers reaches out to everybody um and when she wants to get something done she gains support across the board and she's just so open and honest and she does it with compassion and that's something that I really really admire and there's just so much honesty and realism there um you know and and and I hope that she can attract a lot of women with um these same characteristics into politics because it's very important to you know bring bring along a different view but you also need to bring along this different view of course with with compassion with responsibility um and with an outlook for the future and I feel that she does this brilliantly thank you thank you very much um uh councilwoman that's it's fabulous to hear you um you're talking about perhaps in the past there's been a real focus on strength and you know gritting the teeth and getting on with the job and not showing the emotional side and I think what we're seeing is a change in that and I think jacinda's helped to lead that but I think it it opens up a whole new perspective on leadership uh which is about focusing on people and connecting with people and I think I i will go to um the audience and ask some questions in a couple of minutes but I did just want to carry that um that that trend through the focus through this discussion a little bit more um because I i think as part of that we talk about caring being having a caring role and you've both been through uh political um balancing acts um having young families and I know council hen and your children have come out of the other side and uh and you've survived it and councillor added you're going through it right now um I think it's helpful to just you in terms of balancing acts so so maybe if we start with council councillor because you're doing it now and we've already seen that um that jewel roll this morning uh and then I'll come to councillor hannah and how she she managed it too so so looking forward to hearing from you on that um thank you um it's very challenging I have to be very organized which look I have to be honest doesn't work all the time um namely during covert when um we were doing all our um communication via zoom and all our council meetings sometimes I'd have the three kids in here and it was absolutely ridiculous and I would be so embarrassed I've turned the camera off um but everybody is quite understanding um so I have three two three children um solomon who's nine jacob who's eight and even rose who's um two years old I had her during my term um during this term of counsel um and I have to say namely when I had eden rose it's of a sudden you know my kids had some independence are able to shower and feed themselves and dress themselves and I've gone back to changing nappies and I really forgot what it's like and how much time it actually takes um with juggling the workload um look it has been difficult and at times namely when um I first gave birth to eden rose I'd have to call up a fellow council and say look this is an issue that a constituent is having can you please deal with this like I'm flat out with the new baby and my boys and um look everybody was very very understanding um throughout the organization even at times I wasn't available I had to miss some things um but yeah everyone was very very understanding and now um after covert I believe um everybody has kind of found a new work-life balance namely for myself I do a lot of things on zoom via email I did say earlier that I don't advertise my phone number but um there are constituents that do have my yeah I'm kind of um how can I put this um never in a rush if you like I like to get the correct information before I respond and if this is going to take me you know a couple of days that's fine because I'd rather pass on the correct information to my constituents rather you know then be made a fool of and um kind of not know what's going on and try and get back to them without the correct knowledge or the correct information um and sometimes the state does take me a lot longer because I'm I'm a mother of three and I am their primary caretaker of course and the primary caretaker of the home as well um but yeah I think after covered everything's kind of settled down because now it's more acceptable to work from home or you know work via zoom and yes I do miss a lot of things namely things that are during school pick up or or in the morning during school drop-off um afternoons are quite busy for me's it snack after school um homework shower get dinner ready of course like all the most moms and most families but um it is a very very difficult juggling act but it is very enriching very enjoyable rewarding and I'm glad that I've had this opportunity and I'm glad that my kids can see me trying to make a difference um of course with with the team and the rest of the counselors and it's also made my kids like really aware so if we go to a local park and they'll see something that's not right or the footpath isn't right or you know the swing isn't up to standard they'll pull me up on it which I find quite amusing to be honest um then I find myself coming home and you know sending an email out the the the swing at someone so park is broken you know solomon and jacob weren't impressed and it's it's quite funny it's quite amusing um lots of fun but as well with the fun there is lot of stress there's a there's a lot to take on and think about and a lot of learning um although I am in my fifth fifth year on council I'm I'm still learning there's just so much to take on um there is one counselor that I'd like to mention counselor tony hachidi so he's been on local council for quite a number of years um knows that like the back of his hand um I actually bombard him with questions and I'd actually say he was my mentor throughout um my term and my time on council um he still is he's just so knowledgeable he's a phone call away always gets back to me um and that was quite refreshing um because I am the only woman on the liberal team I'm one of four I'm one of four women on the whole council but I'm the only one on the liberal team so it was quite refreshing to have you know a senior male who was happy to take on that role and outs um also of course the directors are always very supportive and understanding um you know and you know they're happy to even deliver things to the home mainly after I had my daughter they were very very supportive throughout that time so that was really refreshing to see um and it almost encouraged me to uh how can I say this to um to run again and also you know I'd love to run again and it doesn't mean that if I do run again or if I do want a career in politics that I can can't_''_4729.84 be a mum as well I can really have the best of both worlds but in that if you do want that you really need to have excuse me a very good support system I'm lucky enough to have a very supportive partner I have a lot of support from my mother and my mother-in-law and I couldn't have done this without them and I definitely would not have been able to do justice to the position of an elected official if I didn't councilwoman that's uh that's really enlightening uh so if we've got any young women online or or if anyone in the audience knows of a young woman who might be um thinking about running it can be done even with those family commitments so that's that's been great and I liked also the fact that you mentioned a mentor um you know whatever gender that mentor might be whether they're on council or whether they're not I think it's always helpful to have a sounding board in whatever role you're in whether you're an officer like ali and myself or ben but also as a counsellor yeah thanks thanks that's really helpful counselor henan what about your experience so um yeah you're brave and you do a great job it's amazing with young children um I certainly didn't enter politics of any description until I had primary school-aged children but and it's important to have a supportive partner that can sometimes do some of the pickups and drop-offs but I actually found that quite often morgan used to fall asleep under the under the table um but they've actually again like your children they're very aware politically which is amazing I've got one son who has taken his wife's surname simply to show support for the female gender we've got somebody who's a ceo of a multinational company and one young felt the youngest actually helped with advocating for the all abilities playground he helped them draw up some plans and did did a lot of work in that direction so I think if you've got children and actually learn from the experience and taking them along to some events and things is really good um I would relate one funny episode um of how my children are politically aware and we talked about this the other day when you meet somebody quite often as a woman they won't only shake your hand but they'll pull you in and I think you described it as the body hug and the kiss um and you know if you've got friends that you know that's that to intimidate to an extent and I was at an event in this room actually where somebody actually pulled me in and gave me this whopping big kiss and my son at the time was probably about 17 so he turned around and said hello shook hit the fella's hand and pulled him in and gave him a big kiss so I guess your children if you've got children and you need to manage it they will actually learn from the experience they will go places they never thought and see things they never learnt about I for events tend to try and take my husband with me I tonight is a fundraiser for children's research in the area and my husband will come with me council will pay for you to go to events but if you do take your partner you do need to pay for them to go but he's actually enjoys the social unfortunately for me I don't have it and quietly I don't have any grandchildren yet I'd really like that adventure to uh to come and I when it eventually comes but you know for me at this particular point in time my community is I have literally nearly all my time to devote to my community and I want to do that just for the next couple of years so that I can then go and leave it in the hands of all these amazing women that are going to run that's that's fabulous uh insight for both of you thanks um I will ask if there are any questions from the floor or online did you have any questions online thanks okay we do have a question from the floor um so we we're keeping the questions to um the generalized issues we're not going to deal with any personal issues involving any of the individuals here and obviously um we welcome your question thank you hi my name's tina and it's a question about how council advocates to state and federal government on issues that aren't council jurisdiction but moving forward is there a set process or is it dealing with the local members how does that yeah definitely we we're involved in different networks um the the fact we're involved is what council has saying before about the city deals um that's given us the ability to create great relationships at an officer level as well as a political level with all where there's eight nears fit together and discuss we're part of what's called the western parkland councils and those issues sometimes are well addressed if it's a one big voice that's talking so we work collaboratively with the eight councils to raise those there are often inquiries and we make submissions into inquiries if there's review of state legislation or review of policy local governments ask to to put in a submission and give feedback that's another way we advocate rerun campaigns at the moment we've got a couple of campaigns running one on the roads and one on digital connectivity to gather the evidence to enable us to have a good evidence-based approach for when we're advocating to state and federal government to demonstrate this is exactly what's happening on local government you can pass a resolution on the floor of the chamber or at council meeting where you get the support of all your other councils so it becomes a council position on a state or a federal issue we also have developed what we call the state and federal issues paper which is has been adopted by council there are briefing papers attached to that that gives you all the information and each term of council votes on what are the key issues that we want to advocate for there's been lots of advocacy oh that's another campaign I should have mentioned the picton bypass um that we advocate into state government so there's lots of different ways in which that we can support um council when I say we I'm sorry I'm talking from a council officer perspective here um it's been one of my greatest joys is being that piece of the jigsaw puzzle that helps to give the council the information and facilitate that advocacy on your behalf there is also close working relationships with the local member and done through the mayor uh who is the the voice of of council so there's lots of opportunities to be able to advocate on behalf of the community uh because like I said we ground truth at the closest level to be able to uh to put the perspective up there on the on the agenda and tina I would add as well it depends on the issue yeah so depending on what the issue is is the different tactics we might take so as ali said we work with the elected body and we'll advise so we'll say right if this is the issue we want to address then we suggest this is the way we advocate to get that done the other way as well is we also look to be a partner with the state or federal government so we're not going capping hand to the another level of government saying please can you give us something we're going okay we're a partner here we're trying to solve these issues together we have both have a role to play this by working together in that sort of fashion we can often get a much better stronger outcome in a quicker way um than simply throwing some advocacy from the side so it depends on the issue but it's something we're pretty experienced at uh and also something I think as we grow and change over time we'll get even stronger in terms of our advocacy particularly for infrastructure for the local area and some of those big ticket service provisions you know public transport is a is a key one where we are pushing every day for that um to all levels of government um and effectively our broken record in those conversations as well to make sure we get what we need I think I think the city deal shows that we actually that that city deal was local government working with your state and federal governments um stepping back from council for a minute my personal opinion is that we need to respect our members of parliament both state and federal and we need to work with them quite well for me personally I believe because you can give bouquets where they deserved but when you've got an issue that really affects you you can't you don't want to have to follow a party line and I'm sure that's different different council council laws but to be able to um advocate for things that you feel strongly about independently for your community it's not a political way but always happy to work and respect whoever's elected as our member of parliament both state and federal happy to work with them and um yeah we advocate strongly sometimes I mean you would have seen the koala petition that we delivered to state government mind you I think it sort of got through in a basket somewhere to an extent but we'll keep advocating on those things but you need to have that respectful um advocacy shall we call it but be able to give the bouquets but call them out when it's needed thanks catherine did you want to add anything about advocacy hope you're muted yes please I would just in regards to that question said um and also we've had instances at liverpool where we actually um there's state or federal issues that are very important and um um very important and close to our hearts and they do um involve our area our lga and our constituents so we'd actually move a motion on the floor of council or sometimes it could even be an urgency motion um now the mayor has to accept accept the urgency emotion but usually the mayor is on board um if it's a responsible motion and we many a time have moved to lobby the state and federal government um we do this lobbying through writing letters um campaigning bringing it to our local state and federal members attention um so they can speak about it at parliament and bring it up and maybe even move a motion um so yes although we are local local at local level you have a platform which you can use to influence if you like state and federal politics and to voice your community's concerns and even your your concerns and your team's concerns from both of you um we have one more question from the floor if we could have the microphone just before you um ask that question thank you and just identify yourself uh your name and um I'm rhonda vanzella and I'm actually not from this show I just want to congratulate you on what you're doing I'm from the shire you know windy caribbe um so this has been fantastic today but I just want to answer two questions I'm getting my girls to come across to some of these next time how many hours would you spend a week on average I know it goes up and down both of you and secondly more to the staff do you release or does the government release the electoral roll once the nominations close like state and federal they they do when you actually put your nomination in they ask you if you want it used to be a cd with the electoral roll-on and that will close a couple of weeks earlier but there are very specific ways you can or can't use normally not even taken it because I i but yeah you can answer that question and hours it varies so your your responsibility your legal responsibility on council is to turn up to a council meeting once every three months that's what you have to do to fulfill your legal responsibility um the amount of hours counsellors put in vary in a normal week from one hour to probably 20 hours it varies and you can put as much you can work at it full time I've had times when I've literally spent all week and I mean last this week I think I've been every night somewhere um but I didn't have to go so that's and sometimes that's the other thing for example last week we had a tourism conference that a couple of other councillors went to I'll rely on them sharing with me what they gained from it so if you've got a really good working council you can actually cover each other and you can share the information so that everybody is across everything thank you it um differs dramatically depending on um what's happening at council um if you have any as well any extra briefings or events and if you're going to attend all of these events I myself can't attend all the events um and sorry what was the other question I i think it's been answered by judy whether you get the electoral roll when the nominations close okay well I have to take that one on notice if that's possible that's a beautiful example of when you don't have the answer that's something to remember you don't have to give an answer straight away I'll take that on notice you know it's something that that that you you need the skill to learn yeah something you definitely learn in your first term of counsel is you know it's okay to use that line and get the information and then come back um you know with me usually it's a phone call to one of the directors an email or just calling counselor tony hechini because he knows so you their response they can you hear me now yes yes yes thank you yeah so they do kind of um give you a response in a nutshell and it's um really important to make sure you're you're well informed and sometimes for myself I found that I do know the answer but I just always like to you know go back and double check um namely again because it's been it has been my term on council and I think that maybe I'd spend a little bit more time just um navigating answers and um navigating policies and procedures than other counselors would but you know when you've been on council council longer you're on there um it just becomes second nature if you like um like when I went into my first council meeting I definitely wasn't as confident as I am now um now council meeting has become second nature I know the etiquette I know what's accepted and what's not and I had to move emotion on the floor of council whereas previously no I didn feel like I was chucked into the deep end but there was a lot of support um and a lot of inductions for those kind of procedures there's definitely induction on how to conduct yourself in a meeting an understanding of all the different terminology that's going to be another real confronting thing but again as women we tend to be perfect we want to we want to try and show that you know we know everything when we don't not everybody knows everything so there'll definitely be induction and how to how how meetings are run how they're held our governance team well certainly they're an excellent team here at council will take you through how to raise emotion how to how to respond to something um and understanding terminology one of the funny things when I first got elected I thought I was going to file everything and I bought this big file box and you know newspaper articles and and all the policies and I was going to know it all and after about two weeks the box was full and what you need to know is you don't need to know it all your staff and your council will you know if I needed to know a policy from or a meeting from five years ago they will provide it for you so you don't have to worry about those things yeah that's right we're here to help it's our job as ali said there will be a induction program so we'll talk about it a bit more at the candidate forum coming up um but the first few months particularly there will be probably an increased need to be to be present um just to take you through some of those big policies the big strategies and and to plan about where we are going and also provide you the training that you need to do your job effectively um and then from an officer point of view as actually council hannah said at the very start every tuesday night we have something so council meeting once a month community forum once a month um the other couple of tuesdays at the left brief the council on key issues that are going on at the moment or key strategic issues going forward normally they're in the order about two hours or so those briefings um and they're done in person but they're also done online so we have quite a number of our counselors who attend uh by zoom um as well so you don't actually have to come into the council physically to be part of those briefings um the council meetings however you do need to come in and be physically present unless it's an emergency or you have something else that's come up in which case you can ask for permission to zoom in as well so you know that's that I would describe as as minimum although your legal requirements are once every three months but really you know you want to do a good job so get in there and and make the most of it I think I live here more than that oh yeah and I think I think when you're right because what we're looking for you know they're going to want to be here and be able to participate in those decision making processes and and be informed about um the big picture strategic matters that are coming up we have we have so many issues I'm sure councillor during the same boat that um you know you probably don't really um understand all about flood planning but we've just had a presentation for councillors on on flood planning and changes to flood planning we've undertaken significant reviews of our local environment plan and we've undertaken studies to support that in in a whole range of of different areas um and this the consultants who've done that work for us have actually come to council and brief the councillors on the details so it's not expected that you have a full understanding of all those issues the information will be presented and shared and there's always opportunities for questions as well and continued learning just just following on from from that discussion about post covert working arrangements and the use of um digital technology in the to just ask both councillor area and councillor hennan how they see a councillor coming into a uh a new council in in september 2021 will will need to consider uh social media and digital technology in the way that they approach their new working life or how how you know whether that's that's going to be the way they interact with their community um the way that they interact with council and staff um or you know it might be just a great learning tool as well so um maybe start with counselor are you how about social media and technology for yourself mute muted there we go can you hear me now thank you um for myself um I'm actually not on any social media platforms I was in the past but just for personal reasons I decided to move away from social media platforms personally um but I do know that council has well our council has a very active um social media um lots of events are posted on there it's actually a very very important communication tool um and it's um you know campaigns spread a lot quicker via social media now it is something um the council social media is something that I follow but I don't have um any personal pages on there um and sorry what was the other part of the question I supposed to using digital technology you talked about the postcoded world and how you're able to zoom into it yeah yeah um I think it's amazing um namely for for people that have young families um you know male or female because I do know that there are men that are the primary carers of their children also and that are running the household or assisting to run the household so it's just nice to have um you know the electronic version available or you can turn up in person I mean today is the prime example I had um the opportunity to join this panel via zoom or or come in um considering my kids had tutoring and I've got my little one at home who my husband is looking after downstairs at the moment I thought that means during the breaks I can go downstairs check on her put on a load of washing because saturday is my washing okay um mainly for um families that maybe have a member of their family that have that need extra care um you know you can you can be available and still do justice to your role as a profession and it's very refreshing to see that this is now um available to us and it's unfortunate that we have to go through covert for it to be available but um it is it is and it's it's a fantastic work-life balance well here we go here comes my now because yeah well she's gorgeous and that's exactly I think that's what we've talked about um and we certainly encourage us to have a work-life balance and they can work from home some days a week um and it's rare that as officers we would actually go to the city or to um to parramatta for meetings we can do it all online and it's it's provide an opportunity for work-life balance it wasn't available before and I think it it helps to open up um employment to become more accessible uh for many people councillor hennan so I agree with what you're saying the difficulty across a lot of wallindilli is the actual internet reception that we have I can see some people nodding um so for me meetings council have worked to make it as as good as it can be but I always end up coming in here because I can't risk the fact that I'm going to drop out I would say that it gives an alternative so if you're away somewhere you can certainly zoom in um I'm I'm personally much prefer to talk to somebody face to face if I get the opportunity but that's my personal opinion a lot of other people like um social media and those those things um social media I watch I tend not to be on social media a lot um but sometimes I can pick up an issue that somebody's having that they've and sometimes unless I'm alerted to it I can't help so often I'll look at it in that regard um and I guess social media you need to use productively um and don't take things you have to be resilient with social media um I do know and maybe bev could say something about this that there is going to be a social media law brought in by the local government minister um for people who are on council about what your social media can look like and I think this is about being proactive to stop um false information and negative information being put out there is that correct I think it's minister hancock um she's putting out a forum and changing the way um particularly in local government that you can use social media they'll have a platform for um councillors uh which will um protect them it's a protection for counsellors um because I love social media I'm on it 24 7. um absolutely love it because it's interesting to me I'm a person who likes brain and how they act so um and you know I challenge myself uh with their attitudes um so yes uh I think that you'll be protected into the future uh social media have I got time for a question yeah he votes for those responses I think that's it's really important so so I believe that um just just before you ask your question what's really good is you've got some friends that can watch social media for you and alert you if there's a problem so you don't have to be across at all um I think that's really a good hit and texting is good too you'll see you'll see counselors there texting I've been texting it's great for um information and am I doing the right thing um so I've written it down because I think that's a good way to do and I was alerted when ali um posed her conversation um and minds uh going back to why we're here and supported women and why women uh and the like ben to jump in on this and ally and and the rest of the panel need they be I'm putting you on the spot then um and thinking of my experience I've found women need to have a seat at the table you alerted to this uh ally um and just before I go any further I'm an elbow member I haven't got any other elbow members in the audience I know ellie and um judith sorry it's my age um uh elba members in fact um ellie has been absolutely brilliant in the past she actually did our um a strategic plan for us as a member of elma a brilliant young woman absolutely brilliant so thinking my experience I've found women need to have a seat at the table of knowledge and decision making and importantly networking and the starting point of the role of being on a board as a learning tool I found because I'm not educated believe it or not so for 25 years and I've even worked in this uh wallendally shire council for a industry for 25 years my last job was in the planning department so I understand a little bit of what you're talking about all those other things um but the important thing if the women here and women who are online here I'm sorry I can't see you um is that you need a peer group behind you you can't do it on your own the first peer group is your husband or boyfriend if they're not on board we'll forget about it because if they're not on board you're not on board secondly you need men we advocate to have more men participate with elba while I was the membership officer I had associate members and they were men I took that I've been the secretary and the membership officer of elba and while on the board and wallanderi I believe is a member of elba which covers all the councillors it doesn't give you a seat at the table of um being on the board so you have to be an individual member so I suggest take a really fair dinkum then we need people like ben and other men influential men to be beside us not on the other side of the table we want you right here we want you sitting at our conferences you are allowed to come we actually like it and some men really like it because they get to dance with all the women because there's not very many men there so you know men we need you we want to be partners we don't want to tell you how to do it we want you to ask us our opinion and work it out together so importantly if you can get on a board if you're not going to run this time then use the time to get on elgaboard they they choose a board every 12 months you have to be a financial member by december and you can put your name up and nominate so it's not hard to get on a board sometimes it's hard for them to get you off the board I know I've been censured on one of my because I have men beside me and they're the power brokers so you know that but my question was ellie and I know from your experiences and anybody else can answer this as well and particularly ben ali I can see can you see any problems in getting women into leadership roles should women look towards peer groups for support and mentoring because I know in the past and you alerted to the fact that the name change and the tea making I don't know how to make tea I don't know how to do any of those things I don't do any women things and I don't do it certainly don't do any man things my husband has to be home on a monday to put the rubbish out that's not my job um so you have to be a dominant but empathetic and female leader you don't have to be a a female to be a male leader you don't have to take on the male role um you have to have strength so in your experiences ellie and your career what do we do wrong or how do people perceive us that we can't get into leadership roles so easily as men I know it's about the male going to the golf course going to the pub I've been in all that that thing um it's about how you network that's right it's about putting yourself alongside others you want to be like and putting yourselves into making sure you get involved don't stand back and wait to be invited in you've got to actually step in and be involved but it's also about your response I've talked about response before to certain situations to be able to do some of that education around we're all in this together it's not about being a man it's not about being a woman it's about how as you say how we work together to find those solutions and moving forward but it's also how you question sometimes it's just changing the way in which you question because that can sometimes be taken as you women can be seen that way when really all you're doing is trying to gather some information so it's about a bit of reflection on how you ask those questions and also again about being a bit innovative around how how you can resolve a solution like just the name like I said before title change um I was in a situation I'll give you a little example here I was actually the director for works for one area we actually swapped as deputy general managers our portfolio so I i then had the responsibility the outdoor staff the depot and and it was certainly very male-dominated area I didn't perceive I didn't come across as knowing everything I didn't know everything I had to ask I had to gather a knowledge and it was interesting one of the one of the fellas out there one day I rang up about seeing a piece of the uh machinery was no there was no safety equipment around it around and I said to this fella oh I've just gone past this yellow digger thing have I said you know to someone about you couldn't even he said to me you've got to learn how to name those pieces of equipment ali my seven-year-olds even know their names I thought and I felt real deflated now I could step back and not uh you know and and and felt so inadequate or inappropriate but no I reflected on it and I came in the next day and I said I went through those catalogs and I learned the names of all those pieces of equipment I said there's larry the long arm reach arm mower I said there is douglas the digger you know so I made it a bit humorous and it broke down those barriers and from then it's sort of oh come on now let's go out and have a look get yourself immersed involved so it's it's how you you think outside the square and use those situations so as you don't you're all working together and yeah it's about responding at those times you don't know everything you don knowledge um and asking the right questions in the right way to work together and work with each other so it's not about thinking oh I failed at this or I didn't do that right and we sometimes not sometimes a lot of us as women do that it's it's about our response to it and how we actually can work together so just just one sec we need to use the microphone if we're talking from the floor thank you I think there's another side to that don't think to start off and do the problems um you may all do that women don't necessarily work well together um and I think if you go into this um saying to yourself I am going to work with other women because if and when you get onto council it could be the woman sitting next to you who will support your motion but she's not going to if you're a beforehand is that right and we've got an incident in windy caribbean where one of the cat one of the sort of responses she got for the other women are appalling um they see her as their opposition um not wanting to work with her so what are you doing when they get on council and I think that's a big thing for women and I've found that in all my life get on with your women work with your women because they can support you when others won't carry on with that um carry on with that one too the fact that and that's why I mentioned the fact of elbow um we have a young a very young um counselor in uh fairfield by the name of sarah yourmas I've got it right sarah um and um she became the deputy mayor and she belonged to political party but she didn't agree with all the political views and so she challenged them and she went through a terrible time of bullying and harassment by her own members by other people and she sought help from elba now she's a strong vibrant young woman on many many outside committees and advocating things so I would if it's not elba um we've got if you go onto the elbows site and see our members you'll also see they're also members of um local government association new south wales with linda who's just I think stepped down um and um she's from sydney city as the president I think um daria turley has put a hand up at the conference just recently uh to be going forward as the new president hopefully so women do sit in really good positions I now um and as I said I'm not educated I'm a nobody I have a problem I can send a message through to the parliament to parliamentarians and say what's happening here and get a response because I network I know several people around new south wales and local government in high positions not because I'm anybody because I network and I think that's your important thing it's not about whether you know the policies and the strategic plan I know nothing truly I don't but I wonder now all day um I'd like to bring bring ben in as a uh to asking ben uh how men perceive women and how um in his role uh how council can help uh in the in the community to bring women forward into leadership roles as in your community committees all those other things so thank you thanks for those questions I think um and counselor hannah had uh um so um there's a couple of questions in there just a couple um so first of all algo sure I mean sounds like fun um second of all in terms of women in leadership positions so I suppose I can predominantly reflect on my own personal experience and my personal approach I mean for me what my job is I feel is to give people the opportunity the environment that they can succeed no matter who they are and so for me I'm very proud and happy that we've got two strong female leaders on our executive team um and I want to I want us to enable and empower women across the organization to succeed day we had a forum actually in this room right here um with staff who are in non-traditional roles um ali talked about leading the works team our current manager for the infrastructure operations team which includes all the guys with the diggers and I don't know the names either all the guys with the diggers um is a female leader um she's an experienced female leader but she's led that team which is predominantly male dominated um and she has turned the culture around from one where staff where morale was low um and staff weren't overly happy to one where they are happy morale is high they feel empowered and strengthened and the reason why I believe she's done it is because of her as an individual but also because of her style of leadership um and that's what I want to see more you talked about before women not becoming uh men women not taking on the male role for me I think it's actually a bit more about men and women taking on more of the female leadership capabilities um the considered and thoughtful opinions um and so for me personally I actually had some strong female role models in my life and I've um modeled their behaviors and I try and model their behaviors when we're making decisions and in terms of how I leave this organization we lead this organization you know the top things that we've tried to push in the last two years at council that we care about and are committed to ourself that trust is the first thing we do and when we make decisions we make decisions with our staff and our people first and that to me is you know the basis of female leadership so if we can espouse that within the organization I don't see why we can't at an elected council level as well because that's what I think we should be doing and trying to do so I hope that answers your question there yeah I think it does I think I'll be saying very much and particularly in interviews having a sorry smell out boys uh gender and neutral I um and and gender neutral is good in certain areas of our society and I think particularly when you're going for an interview it should be it should be based on um merit based and it should be not on gender um and I've found throughout my lifetime which has been very vast and had many many jobs um that in many occasions if you don't belong to the local pub or the golf club or wherever and it's not a gender neutral um interview you don't have any chance of getting the job regardless of what your experience is and I know that many um and just my personal um and not family or anything else just personal uh networking with ellie um several um people in in areas outside of wellington have missed out on her excellent experience and whatever um you've got a as you said two wonderful directors but I don't know um our other director unfortunately I'm sure I will get to know them um so one thing I forgot to mention actually is um something that you might be interested in um that often recruitment systems are all about capabilities right so are you a really good driver of that digger we're we've actually piloted an approach which we're going to roll out across the organization which has capabilities and values um and so we'll we'll actually have a whole lot of schools within that interview process regarding people's individual skills um on you know the key key issues they need to in terms of their job but also their values are they someone who really displays strong integrity respect do they look after other people and we score that through the process at the end of the process those values are a really key part about how we make a decision on recruitment and you know that is what you're talking about which is actually not making a decision based on gender or just capabilities but also their values and what they're all about because what we want is we want people who to come here who fit into the culture who care about each other difference for the local community and that's what that process is all about now I might just give over to councillor because I think you wanted to add something I was going to say I agree with all of that but the first step for women to get into leadership roles is to put themselves forward and that's what you're all doing or looking at by being here today and it's not about I can't or I don't have time or anything else you all have all the skills and I as I look around you don't you don't even have to run for counsellor you could all run for mayor and do a good job because you have the support you will have hopefully the support of your counselors and your staff you shouldn't undervalue each of you you can do anything every single one of you that I see can do anything you just have to put yourself forward and that's the first step and then you can take on working with everybody else and all the rest know you have every capability to do anything just put yourself there yeah I think this has been an excellent discussion I might just ask councillor if she wants to add to it I will be just before I hand over to you councillor um I was at a local government uh conference um earlier in the week and this is exactly um a trend across many organizations within local government and also outside of local government where there's more of a focus on on attitude and interpersonal relations and the view is that you can actually um develop the skills and train people in the knowledge but they have to have the right attitude they have to be the right fit and I think that's what ben's ben's focus is here with our recruitment processes we want people who are the right fit in the first instance and that's what we're saying we want people who are the right fit on our council and those people are the ones who are passionate about community and who want to make a difference um don start with cancer aid thank you um I'd have to agree with everything that's been said so far and I'd also like to say definitely um women need to lift each other up and support each other and encourage each other and it doesn't only fall on us it falls on men in our community our partners our brothers our fathers our uncles I feel like sometimes women need a little bit of encouragement and a bit of a push I know for myself after I had my first son he had some health issues and then I had my second son and I was at home for five years and then and I actually nominated the council in 2012 and after I put in my nomination I just um felt a little bit deflated and I thought you know what I'm going to withdraw and I did withdraw and then second time around came 2016 and I thought you know what I'm going to nominate again and I did actually consider withdrawing again because it is a male-dominated space it's a male-dominated all the support systems that were available to me professionally at a professional level level whether it be inside council or related to the party um anyway and then this time around I i stood my ground and I thought no I'm gonna have a go and I'm gonna do it and you know it was little things like I hadn't been on a computer for god knows how long while I was you know changing nappies and caring for my two my two children but um there was a lot of support and a lot of training um the induction is fantastic um and there was something else that I went along to that I'd really like to mention it was um a course run by the australian institute of company directors and I did the director course um and they do actually run a lot of courses that are open to counsellors and they're very professional and um they're recognized um and that really helped me a lot just to build confidence um build you know directorship uh vocab know what uh um so I'd encourage everybody who has the opportunity to do a course through the australian institute of company directors to do so um it's unfortunate I only had time to do one I would have liked to do to do more and that's something that you know is on my to-do list but yeah in a nutshell we do women have to lift each other up men have to lift their women up and we just have to support each other and get the right people with the right skills into the right areas and you have to have a go that's great that's great thank you yeah you talk about if you don't know what you're capable of yeah thank you and oops yeah I'm just losing you a bit then counselor just when you said you have to have a go we all agree oh we've lost you I think uh I think eden rose has muted you they know how don't they and this is one of the things we're still struggling with into um well I was just saying you you um you mentioned having a go and you also talked about the company director's course two things that really resonate with us um here because we're we're certainly encouraging our counselors in the next term I think to look at that company director's course I've done it myself and I agree with you I think it's it's a fabulous learning platform and it will help councillors um understand more about the the broader role of being a director I think councillor hannah was going to tell us I was going to say that we're talking with the ceo that that was something that they were talking about uh bringing two council laws um the company directors portions of that course to help everybody and that will not only see you well through um council but everything else that you do going forward I would highly recommend it great force really really good in terms of bringing that strategy to um governance frameworks the financial frameworks it really adds a lot um it is but the and algorithm I'll tell you as a member of elgua every year um elba run what they call a margaery propsting fund and councillors and staff can apply as financial members to win that they have one a year and that goes towards any improvement within your capacity as a counselor or as a staff member so not only did the council have to provide training for councillors but if you're on el where you do and every year um my my staff at um penrith council were always in the mix and most times unless they didn't apply they got that scholarship and we've had councils that have benefited from that scholarship that's that's great um look I think we're um we're looking at um coming to a close now so I thought that we might wrap up by um asking each of the panel members with some closing remarks uh you know what do they think would be the key messages for a potentially aspiring candidate to take away from today's session um so I might start with ali whole panel oh thank you thanks tony look key messages today knowledge is power educate yourself grab uh ask questions grab a network a support system around you um there are resources and there are contacts and we've got lists of those available here today for you if you're not sure where to start I know we haven't covered the topic or mentioned about campaigning because that's what you're about to head on to um it's it's something that we can't really assist you with as council officers that's crossing the realm um into into that but we can provide information there are ways in which you can get information through formal applications for information if you need from your council you just need to put in what's called a gipper application to to get information but there's a whole table down there and there will be information disseminated to those online about how to campaign with key contacts and and what to do and what to consider so I encourage you to collect that information um and have because there is a whole framework in which you've got to work within as a candidate there's dates and time frames certain amounts of dollars you're only allowed to spend on your campaign don't get tripped up by not having the knowledge and knowing what you need to do more importantly think about your response to things because it will define you okay thank you thank you ellie great great questions um ben um I suppose I would wrap up by saying it's an incredibly exciting time to be at well in delhi um sorry for when do you care be friends but well and deal is obviously a much more exciting place to be um look out australia is growing okay the growth is here um and we have a really bright future ahead of us and the role of a councillor is to come together with the rest of the council to lead that change to take advantage of the future that's ahead of us you know we are going to grow we are going to change let's make that a we can really you know bring to life the vision of the elected council which is an individual lifestyle of historic villages modern living rural lands and bush and what that's about is maintaining the special places we have but also embracing the future that's ahead of us um the other thing I would leave everyone with if you don't mind is also if there are people that are considering running um I'm offering to any candidate if they want to come in and have a one-on-one chat with me to find out any question they would like to ask or whatever that might be you're welcome to do so my contacts are on our website um that offer is open to everyone you just gotta make your time to come on down and have a chat as well because there might be things you don't want to raise right here or things that percolate through your brain that you want to ask come and have a chat and happy to talk at any time and the third thing if you don't mind in local government I hope to see more women on wallabelli shy council next time around um to me diversity diversity brings great decision making so I hope to see a great council of us great thank you thanks very much ben um councillor hennan on councillor you will ask you for your um your final messages um do you want to go first council or area yeah will do um I'd just like to say that more recently there's been um you know a political awakening if you like across all parties um recognizing that more women should be involved and need to be involved um namely women from you know all walks of life um professionals mothers um and I do believe that this is needed at all levels not only at local I think of course um yeah we do need more women involved at all levels of politics federal state and local you know we're lucky enough to live in a country where we can be involved and we have the opportunity to so let's take it let's support each other thank you thank you that's great messages she's resilient and absolutely and we're seeing this message coming out of state and federal parliament at the moment aren't we in terms of female friendly workplaces and family-friendly workplaces and I think we've just seen an example of why that is look at um you know what uh a councillor is juggling and and and doing it well so yeah thank you so much for your your um contributions today we'll just start wrap up with councillor hanging well you all have it in europe you can all make a difference instead of people sitting back and and saying anything you will enjoy yourself so much you will make so many friends and have so many experiences that you just can't even believe down a mine up in a tower all sorts of things and meet all sorts of people interesting people from all walks of life it's your opportunity every single one of you have the ability to do it all um I have full faith in that I am happy to answer staff can't_``_8188.32 do if you're with me or against me I don't care either way um I want more women around that table and walingili is just an amazing place to be in and live in and by us all contributing we can make it the best we can for the future thanks very much councillor hannan um look I think there's been some fabulous insights today from our panel members about what it is to be a counsellor about what it isn't what you don't have to have and I think it is really helpful for us in our in our goal to get more um diversity into council and obviously into our organisation as well but in this case we're talking about council I really would encourage you to take those messages messages away um take up the ceo's offer if you want to uh talk with him about uh having a one-on-one and certainly um reach out to councillor hannah and I'm sure councillor ian would be happy for you to send her an email uh you can it's really helpful ali and I look forward to um the the election ahead and and to welcoming some new um called the council staff yes yeah absolutely uh welcoming councillors to um um and and thanks council hendon so not only do I want to thank the panel members I'd like to thank the governance team and our i.t team who have helped put this together uh matt toro is here he's our assistant director people and legal and governors and governors um so yeah thanks to matt and to all the team for uh your help in pulling this together and

Get a on Damien sterling from Melinda Lee Shire Council on the environmental education off somewhere out here in the bush today as part of the woollen daily koala conservation project now with this project in 2013 and 14 we're getting a lot of reports from the community telling us about koalas occurring around the apon area so we set up the wall in daily koala hotline and in the first 12 months we had over 60 koalas reported as a result we were able to secure a saving our species grant in partnership with the office of environment and heritage now we're in a koala habitat corridor that runs from apon down to wilton and through down to Avon Dam and we've got big forests red gums and stringy barks which are all primary food trees for koalas now the thing about those trees is that they occur on clay soils so it's a very small corridor that we're working and try and ascertain where the koalas are moving and how they're moving through that corridor and then from that we can start that corridor into the future now we've been working closely with the oeh and the koala health hub and 15 koalas have been colored for tracking so each time we catch a koala we put a GPS unit and a VHF transmitter onto the collar around its neck so the GPS unit on the koalas collar sends its location twice a day over the internet and then this website allows us to view the koalas position basically in real time so we can see here the last 10 days of movements of one one the koala and from the VHF transmitter that lets us track the koala in the field to go and collect information on the tree species where it's moved how big the trees are and that sort of thing now a lot of the koala habitat Oh areas of the corridor actually occur on private land so currently as part of the project we've been out to sixty different private properties and everybody who owns those properties has been really excited about the project as well if you see a koala hanging in a hotline so that we can come out confirm the sighting and add that in Mayson into our database also another way that people can get involved is with conservation volunteers Australia and you can come out and help volunteer within that koala corridors income and help restore their habitat and if you're just lucky you might get a chance to go out and go tracking and actually see a koala in its natural habitat one of the big issues that we have here is that koalas have been struck by cars on up and road picked and Road and also the Hume Highway with the information that we've gathered about roads strike of koalas we've been negotiating with the RMS to try and get some protected wildlife fencing on picton Road particularly around Allen's Creek and cascade creek well indeed Lee wires if you see an injured koala on the side of the road give them a call also sydney wildlife and also the south coast wildlife rescue the important thing about these koalas is that they're the only disease-free population in the state and of them so we all need to work together to try and save these koalas and make sure that the habitat is protected for generations to come

 I got into electronics mainly because of my dad and and actually my family and from about age 10 to 12 including actually a visit to sydney to a microelectronics company here and probably will be in 1963 so I was from south australia and this visit really you know they were making transistors at that stage and just inspired me to get into that area I'm obviously an old guy so I've had a long career so I've done a lot of things one of the things I did was write the textbook that people learn from even today to design chips that go in most of the products that we use another highlight was getting involved with early wi-fi startup here in sydney I came back from the us and we started a company was one of the uh the first wi-fi companies in the world I've also been involved in flight software for pilots so that's also something that I'm very proud of australia's the home of wi-fi technology which a lot of people probably don't know but the third generation company in wi-fi uh redefining wi-fi and in fact morsels started in picton so there's a kind of an interesting twist in history here that I'm here talking about this today and the company I'm working for actually was started in picton I got involved with morse 2016 working on the next generation chips to enable a kilometer uh wi-fi instead of your normal hundred metres so that's what we do here in sydney the other thing that we we do here is we kind of encourage new graduates into the area and we run a new graduate program where we take 10 or so graduates every year and kind of put them through the system and teach them everything they need to know about next generation wi-fi systems when you have a passion uh for something you actually don't really feel like you're going to work and you know in general that's just a message for young people is if you can find your passion you'll find that you'll have a path to greater things and you almost 20 years in the u.s and I decided to come back to australia you know deliberately one of the reasons I decided to come back to australia is that I think that first of all we're we embrace maori cultures and we do that in an honest fashion the second thing is that we have a balanced society in terms of looking after people who are not so well off so we at least try to help people all people in australia have a good living and I think that's you know the most important thing about australia is that it's a very balanced society and we gain a lot from our immigration and and the australians coming in as well as all of our you know existing people that live here you
Residents of one andouille Shire enjoy rural living and each day the 800 kilometers of Road play an important part in their lives the challenge for Wallander the Shire Council is to keep the roads clear of vegetation this offers motorists improved Road Safety through greater visibility it also helps reduce bushfire hazards along these roads and better drainage by cutting vegetation in table drains prior to 2011 council employed contractors to help with this important clearing work but rising costs and increase use of one and Dilli roads necessitated the purchase of a reach arm mower since March 2011 the reach arm mower has worked tirelessly to help keep vegetation back from the edge of our roads the work is ongoing with this machine in the last two years councils been able to undertake a lot more work than we ever could do with contractors before they often weren't available we try and get the machine on the road every week if we can and it's often hard going that we've got dead tough wattle trees we've got hidden obstacles such as star posts and get through quickly and sometimes it's just a heavy work getting through the setup of the mower allows it to safely cut vegetation less than 100 millimeters in diameter larger vegetation requires conventional chainsaws and chippers the reach our mower consists of a conventional tractor with a hydraulic powered mulching unit fixed to the back the unit is mounted on an articulated arm and it can cut at angles where other tracked or wheeled machinery cannot operate the reach arm proof work closely with counselors environmental section and before any work is undertaken the Rhoden area is assessed for threatened species but more recommendations affect the mine by if there's good remnant vegetation there we will take minimal amount so that there is a good line of sight on the road for safety reasons and if there is lots of weeds on the road we'll be taking it more of the woods yet to control the weeds will also be doing hazard reduction works to do with fire management on lots of these roads so in that case we'll be taking more vegetation off the roads distances from the road have been developed to minimize damage to native and established vegetation this machine has enabled wall and Dilli to improve the sight lines on our roads PPI drains working better but most importantly reducing ambushed fire hazard in critical areas the mower is able to clear approximately half a kilometer of road per day depending on the terrain and has made noticeable differences to the safety and aesthetics of Wallander Lucia if vegetation is causing a hazard in your area please contact Council
 hi my name's mary sonata and I'm a local wallendilly resident today I'm doing an italian version of an australian staple we're doing sausages with potatoes in a wood-fired oven the italian way and we're doing fritoli which we have with coffee today we're making saucy con patate alforno which is italian sausages with potatoes in the oven in a wood-fired oven so we've got sage rosemary garlic fennel seeds chili flakes salt pepper olive oil and white wine so a good glug olive oil don't forget salt this flavor you need flavor fennel seeds nice couple of pinches a bit of chili that's up to you how hot you like them lots of garlic sage freshly picked from my garden rosemary very very northern italian flavors just there white wine and pepper pork fillet sausages these are italian sausages potatoes in and we mix and we turn get the flavours going everywhere now this is going in my wood-fired pizza oven today but it can also be done in your normal oven on a nice hot heat of probably going to re-salt the top three pepper okay now we foil and she goes straight in the oven and we're just going to check it every now and then as it's cooking now it goes into my wood fired oven you've got all the heat down there that's it okay and now the door goes on to seal everything in now we're making something to have with coffee called fruitily we need eggs vanilla lemon rind we've got sultanas soaked with brandy sugar salt and flour break the eggs we're going to add the sugar you don't eat these if you're on a diet but be good they're very good for your soul and the vanilla and we're going to beat that and here we go I have been after this recipe for many many years no one shared so you're very lucky and I have my friend gilda to thank so now I have to add grated lemon rind don't go down to the white because that's bitter you just want the the you just get that little bit more flavor you can replace the lemon with orange if you like when they're in season or you can do a mixture of both this is yellow gold two cups of self-raising flour doesn't need to be sifted just start off slowly otherwise you're going to look like a snowman we're going to add our macerated sultanas so it's about a cup now you're going to find the dough very heavy we're going to lighten it up with a bit of milk just to loosen it and this dough has to be just so we can drop spoonfuls into frying oil so when I lift it will drop that's what I want because they will make the fruit chili and that's it until we heat up our oil my parents both came from italy northern part of italy called a town called paldova back in the 1960s they came here because there was no money in italy and they came for a better life my dad came first and sent for my mum later and history growing up we had a very tiny house that we rented three bedrooms with 11 people living in this little house so it was a kitchen stroke laundry and the dining table was in our lounge room because that's the only place it would fit something I would have from my childhood that I can't get now is my mum's chicken sauce with the pasta she used to make I don't know how she made it because I she was she passed away when I was young so I can't get the recipe but the flavor is still in my mouth that I would go back for any time okay here we go coming along nicely so we're putting sunflower oil into my pot which is being heated up as we speak so that's probably a good two centimeters in there what happens is as they cook they're going to flip we're using sunflower oil because sunflower oil tends to give it not much flavor so it doesn't interfere with the recipe you'll get the true lemon and just about there bits floated to the top now we're ready so now we're going to start frying so teaspoons at a time dollop them in keep them a little bit spaced apart so they don't stick together they're flipping as they're browning which means they're cooking well we want them a really nice golden brown we don't want them too light otherwise they'll be raw in the center a heavy dusting of icing sugar and you've got to do that as you go so while they're warm the icing sugar will stick there we go eat well so you

that you each will be captured as plot this recording if you object to being film please do for the council officer I would pay my respects acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which this meeting takes place and also pay respect to elder's birth pastor prison I'm attunements tonight and would like to eat you introduce you to your counselors and I might add that every counselor is here this evening the deputy mayor Councillor Robert calm but councilman Vanessa council a breeze counselor Matt Smith Council no Larry Council met DS Council met booth and council Sonia Lander also president the general manager Luke Johnson executive director alley ditch director of planning priesthood and director of infrastructure in violet light of my life I'd like to ask first any counselors will staff have a conflict of interest to declare in line without community forum violence we don't believe media without permission this includes devices such as laptops mobile phones recording somebody who knows who is tape recorders and video cameras please place your mobile phones on the side there are two parts to perform the first part is presentations the presentation tonight is on the review of counsels position on the world of Newtown the second part is the community question state that time and we will consider these items discussed miss pie at the extraordinary meeting tonight straight after lice councils are these are going to poppy and all the questions submitted to consider even if they aren't addressed tonight if time allows we will have some other questions from the floor mind you we've got quite a few questions to get through so we need to limit them to five minutes each so we're going to have a presentation person the presentation tonight on the review of counsels position on the world and new town big event event just as we commenced the presentation is one of the critically important issues in relation to run the booth in Newtown and the rezoning relaxed brief video on the screen in relation to the spracf bubbly get aiong Damian stealing from all in Delhi Shire Council on the environmental education off somewhere out here in the bush today as part of the woollen dilly koala conservation project now with this project in 2013 and 14 we're getting a lot of reports from the community telling us about koalas occurring around the apon area so we set up the wall in Delhi koala hotline and in the first 12 months we had over 60 koalas reported as a result we were able to secure a saving our species grant in partnership with the office of environment and heritage now we're in a koala habitat corridor that runs from apon down to wilton and through down to avon dam and we've got big forest red gums and stringy barks which are all primary food trees for koalas now the thing about those trees is that they occur on clay soils so it's a very small corridor that we're working and try and ascertain where the koalas are moving and how they're start to make some informed decisions about how we can conserve that corridor into the future now we've been working closely with the oeh and the koala health hub and 15 koalas have been colored for tracking so each time we catch a koala we put a GPS unit and a VHF transmitter onto the collar around its neck so the GPS unit on the koalas collar sends its location twice a day over the internet and then this website allows us to view the koalas position basically in real time so we can see here the last 10 days of movements of one one the koala and from the VHF channel that lets us track the koala in the field to go and collect information on the tree species where it's moved having the trees on that sort of thing now a lot of the koala habitat ooh areas of the corridor actually occur on private land so currently as part of the project we've been out to sixty different private properties and everybody who owns those properties has been really excited about the project as give us a call on the wall and early hotline so that we can come out confirm the sighting and add that information into our database also another way that people can get involved is with conservation volunteers Australia and you can come out help volunteer within there koala corridors income and help restore their habitat and if you're just lucky you might get a chance to go out and go tracking and actually see a koala in its natural habitat one of the big issues that we have here is that koalas have been struck by cars on up and Road picked and Road and also the Hume Highway with the information that we've gathered about Road strike of koalas we've been negotiating with the RMS to try and get some protected wildlife fencing on picton Road particularly around Allen's Creek and cascade creek well indeed Lee wires if you see an injured koala on the side of the road give them a call also sydney wildlife and also the south coast wildlife rescue the important thing about these koalas is that they're the a small population there's only 350 of them so we all need to work together to try and save these koalas and make sure that the habitat is protected for generations to come okay obviously an extremely precious and medical resource to have you know the enemy disease-free kamikaze the state dining at South Weaver's time you still use mister on the video is just going to talk a little bit more about it just for a few minutes then we'll have a presentation from still giving relations and strategic planning aspects and then it'll be over to the questions with Jamie right thank you I thought I'd introduce you to some of the local koalas we have two emails Londo she's a young three female three years old and she's actually been living down in the southeast corner of the reason the area she's had a GPS collar on her from the last six months has since November 1 1 there beside her he's been hanging around just south of the Wilton reasonand area there he his tenure on koala babies coming on but cabo marries particular interest because he traveled all the way over from athen over the last six months he's traveled all the way over to Wilton he came across the broad and Gorge and unfortunately late last year we lost him to a road strike on meteorite really highlighting the issues that were having in that area now Alan's Creek has been known to me a koala corridor for a long time professor Robert closely to peer review of some reports are associated with the Wilton parklands development and he identified that Alan's Craig does a primary corridor at that stage it was mainly males that were dispersing so when a man becomes two three years old they need to move away that's what Islands Creek was all about what they identified is there were twenty sightings within a five kilometer radius of the islands green corridor between ninety one mm for now as part of those records it was noted that there was a mother to koalas down it's Mary's site now gear which was sign that we had photo in the film that we just saw that pink area is habitat quality so I have attack models that were mapped in 2007 by the office environment heritage and I was identified back then all that pink area there was primary quality at attack you can see the areas where we've proposed putting some fencing in because of the road strike hotspots as well an RMS have been very amenable today now the project's been running for two years like I said we've got the Sun down one month now down in some areas late last year there were two females with backyard so that's a critical aspect to it being defined as a call to all the habitat but also in the last five years we've had a drone killed on the Allen Street corridor itself on picton Rome so again assign the quality using that corridor to travel between the Nepean River and down to the Nepean Conservation Area now all that's all the sightings from buying it as you can see this quail is everywhere a lot of that really so the koalas have been moving from athen and down to Milton and sort of back and forth but you can see if you track Allen's pre captain in the ping River there's been koalas side trip throughout that area for the last twenty years now the big thing for us is that except 44 which is the standard on mental planning policy for koala habitat protection the criteria on core habitat is that we have a resonant population of koalas and that's evidenced by breeding females and also recent sightings as well as historical records we have that information here at this point in time if this was going through council there would be a comprehensive quality management there to be put in place before any reasonings were approved and as far as we're aware this hasn't occurred yet you know this is a critical population this is part of Sydney's last population of koalas they go from here up to camel town if all the koalas and all the picked and run of the only disease-free koalas in the state and we we want to see the southwestern Sydney while conservation strips are put in place where the progress happens 200,000 worth of research has gone into this and if this is going to be inaud ignored then we need to question why thanks very much Dana all right just one quick question that circle is basically to the south to be derived that's where his own dough has been residing for last six months just to put the context we thank you now in terms of the significance of this issue and the reason we started with a presentation on this it's not only is it a critical issue but in speaking about it we're speaking about a lot of a community that can't speak for itself and I think that's particularly so now Stephen gather a strategic plan is going to be visual presentation in relation to some planning as fairly short so basically I just want to give a big I feel up lately on our lobby hates nor will the new Tim as you might know since about 2011 party peasants library announced other so that's just get up since that time two thousand twelve thirteen fourteen councils continually advocated that it's generally supportive of it providing that it's supported by the writing the structure and blocking his address so it's been a consistent message about till recently I believe the informations on the other side said that the message is being pretty clear the whole item will turn right down in my territory in terms of the amount of you ironically by bidding the most recent government the ring same 36,000 hazardous previously I believe it started off in about twenty-five hundred and then there's a three as ensuring exhibition it kind of physics hundred that's houses it's not including the population in America fetuses that there's a new weather development sign that wasn't exhibited as part of the exhibition launch B so it's nice to everyone it's a very very basic design so much depend on she needed to get bit inside it's very active engine it's not a cute prohibited man Jesus he made that was very is a place-- jazz intensities so I believe this may be somewhat consistent effectiveness I previously said 15 to 20 project has his good it did what that means he see the drones jewel occupancy as he said is slightly taller density then he's sucking up to twenty five to twenty five passes per hectare which is a much higher density again generally the densities what they would define for me a Savoy bought the right infrastructure and what services the building pods not shining this generally were made as possible there are pockets of 12 meters around two of the main areas that was magnets which I show see the same if you've got the playmates presentation where we have a circle with the city and surety around the red eye you shake down the bottom a of these is a really important hurdle the two just the context each another planner and then woman how do you love being out at water started get got a gorge and nearby sites a substantial that's one person Jeff what a lot of the criticism that when I government hasn't provided a job to seek for us here so the jerk Mary bloody miss Russia has been committed at this stage which pigs until these issues but another transport and I commend them to the public transports made in my jet the government tells us that there might be a shrimp us solutions etcetera we don't know they don't know if they're going to actually burn we've been told that they're probably going to happen I didn't we've been advocating a collection point gryal whole range of other public transport solutions but it's nothing big money for us yet visit a voluntary plan agreement that was strong durable is but be this especially with the structured contribution to see isn't they dropped a bit one information on the website it cooks about that time trying they need tonight in the city the department releases he 2101 you would think that you have been plans in the infrastructure look at a project delivered as chiropractors shall be neither to expect Jones took you've got a one to one those jobs on the ground what are the real jobs that we're gonna secure how did that a lot of thing through an integrated health care pray seems a hospital again they're talking about possibly providing this is kinda precent but we haven't seen that be consuming it's not to say as I said it's top counsel to this point have been generally supported the bulletin providing was done in the right way with the black beans I think from a castle emphasis upon a TV 31 I wanted to show that the playing style is the construction of white convenience my allergies thank you Steve 33600 ends in his reasoning council is a very clean and consistent in his advocacy in relation to write Newtown or none Channel and that concerns we've got a number of concerns and somewhat to his community question will state that time this is all relating to item gr one review of counsels position on will to Newtown an extraordinary meeting agenda we will limit speakers to five minutes and forums we hope to provide information will allow comment they are not a debate might convey and resume is a chair or counselors on all occasions and please stick on to the subject matter done make personal remarks about individuals general manager we've done so already at the executive summary from the council report for the agenda item discussed tonight so the executive summary reads his father's the purpose of this report is to praise the recent rezoning move to the southeast precinct under legislation a person who makes a relevant planning application or product submission is required to disclose any reportable political donations the disclosure requirements extend to any person with a financial interest to the application or any associate of the person making a public submission no disclosure political donation has been made in association with this application well now it's really an abbreviated version of the recommendation that's in the report because the recommendation report quite a lot but it aspires the council brought to the New South Wales period Minister for planning informing them that council intends to reconsider it's in including a business case for delivery of electrified rail establishment of an integrated health care proceed demonstrated compliance with job creation targets preparation and finalization of the southwestern Sydney koala conservation strategy and received a response from the fifth degree February 2019 that was super motion from the bottom of landing an environment so it's still a waiting game in response to the report also recommends a further it would be referred to an Audrey council meeting in June outlining any response from the South Wales government to the above Metis so that council can reconsider its invincible support for rules and actions that council writes to the Minister for planning requesting the emerging repeal of the rezoning of that portion of Wouter and southeast precinct that falls upon the islands credit chronic koala habitat corridor the council writes to the Federal Minister for the environment and energy requesting and speed knees last while popular should be particular the federal Environmental Protection biodiversity conservation act 1999 and finally the council seat involvement from interested community representatives to assist counsel in the further promotion of councils a great new town add that if you can just wait till the council meeting straight after this I suspect that whilst that's the recommendation council rules will probably put it alternate that's probably stronger than that so we'll see how we go can I have two speakers first speaker up tonight is Christine Nelson it's Christine use it Black's come up to the microphone the counselors thank you question there are a lot of things I would have liked or commented on but I decided to just go with one specific aspect if this detail is going and the one focused on is transport infrastructure and I won't go into rail because there are experts that will do a much better job than me on that but I would like to talk about funding for transport infrastructure and in particular the road network last during last year I made the button of mr. Jarvis discuss I've had the benefit of working out since for numerous years where people are much more open in their thinking to alternative ways of approaching something and one of the the bureaucracy and the can't_''_1404.39 do it that by attitude rather than the can do so my suggestion to mr. Ali is I've given a lot of thought grunting read through the API is an understand have been Theo's work so eventually developers provide all this family before it was all sort of into infrastructure but particularly to council of the roads so my questions mr. al was why can't the state government loan the money for the infrastructure to council the council roads prior to development starting and this money could then repaid as the BPA he wouldn't attribute so they're ultimately known as is that a profit people are happy you have the right infrastructure to start with and it particular community would be happy about that so my question is to counsel has council considered approaching state government for an interest-free loan for the development of rogue infrastructure prior to any development such a loan would be able to be repaid as developer meet the requirements of the ER triggered events very short and super idea I'm sure that's something that we thought you could do thank you this mysterious two methyls it was not possible they'd had to go back to answer any of these possible exactly thank you can I have a suit guy please that ridge line means critically endangered by both state and federal government it's just not a future count because we are the other best students others the developers to develop this is just another burden to overcome but the aliens lost that Darius take that take years to regenerate the critically endangered Cumberland lands males develop the samplers chippies on the McCoy door opening for purposes we will move them more likely snail bait if you ask me and a TAC meeting a planner for state government stated that any fire logs in the areas will be pasted with cement once Wow however system already appreciate that you briefly I will touch another Road only honor how did you tell your son as a as he has immersed a young lady that died in your arms that the nightmares will eventually go away what he said amor it has been used as a political football by both sides of state and federal governments and developers thrown into the equation headlines last week federal if they promising stump grinding and other things to the tune of 50 million dollars rector finally only 5 million up front we have thought concepts before an election time the February under humanoid m5 used for developers benefit instead of it's real purpose the important fact on up and Rodan paths to get a very small comparison of what world-ruling juror use happened as a president what other community have suffered is incomprehensible an example a developer going to adjoin or lady in a nursing home and asking her to sign there and over to eat on a dotted line bringing National Parks and Wildlife's associations non-compliance is another issue but we won't talk about that too deep in students in Adam has a da ting for demolishing at Council the demolition has already commenced the site is full of asbestos and made many varied illegal chemicals I wonder how long before we have another Camden High School debark work that and 8350 hun sites on this land what is very unjust about the entire issue is that there is no little plain bill developers and much multinational broadcaster they have huge amount of political influence as discovered under federal upward listing of power brokers the Western Sydney dialog first meeting for developers and council this company is the power broker for amongst others lend-lease Walker's and Kendall Town Council the definition of a power broker a person who deliberately affects the distribution of political and economic power by exerting influence or buying through and the judge has been critical of our mayor during the past week I wonder if that was because he's dealing with extant underground Richardson the tenth power broker for Walker developments Allen Jones you've made me choke we're caught out on that issue land banking is right on ready some submissions of the greater Sydney Commission despair groans I quote from Wegmans the draft plan recognizes affordability as a critical issue and six to address upon making housing housing more affordable in terms of increasing supply and diversity of type products 725 new plans to accommodate the 2.1 people million people by 2 or 3 6 that is 800 with 25,000 but if you're gonna come into a community and change things you need to change it this does not mean rush through and takes your cuts this does not mean in all rules we expect more from the developer wharf captain more violently and really Southwest we will be the ones that are left living with the increasing costs associated with your core planning we will be the ones stuck in the traffic jams you have caused by your inadequate traffic movement and by the absence of electrified rail we will be the ones coping with the odor and the environmental impacts of your multiple sewage treatment plants this is the legacy that you would leave us if you continue down this part we want you just stop take the time to do a proper business cuss work together with the other developers with government and with the community to get a combined master plan that is work for one that is integrated and worthy of the field you have think about the future of the environment of sustainability and about children that will grow up with the legacy that you are about to cook yet we expect more you need to deliver or cut your losses and get thank you you see the who do it please I like to fire okay I'm very uncommon to public speaking but certain cases need to be talked about I grew up in a very tiny country town call box in half just up the road from pornhub we all know what happened there it's a city of houses and traffic types this is what is headed this way I just read an article this morning said about 15,000 pounds of coming for this area this means for Wharton southeast but it isn't it should be treated as a whole the big picture must be looked at the brothel ingredient is transported its well-known fact the towns without row but towns with rail drive without stagnate and die for wooden southeast the Water Corporation we've just said that it will stick south 3600 that's a 5,000 homes and they actually think that is very conservative his love for the rail the Malden Dumbarton rather is not on the current matters why has it been messed up is it not coming for the rollers from the voluntary planning the green 10 million has been and walkers for the road connections to picton relative previous reports depict and rather from the a burn proposal the airport proposal was 46 million to bring picked and rode office standard 46 million who is kind of a collector with 5,000 homes that's our estimate our low estimate for books in southeast no trans fats at least 10,000 cars added to the already picked and rode must be upgrade to at least as I said who will pay for this 46 minuts 460 million that's a helluva lotta money for trains here is it something to think about how does a school ever get to walk on uni this is our local unit of technology the way of the future for this area to breathe intelligent productive mines educational is just a basic necessity apparently it would take seven right there by 10 minutes by bus depicted 30 minutes trying to count down and an hour minutes to walk that's a total of an hour and 55 minutes to get to Union de penny if the transfers we can't beat up to four and a half hours asking for my teacher or their alternative is to drive for 35 minutes and that is what young drivers mixed in with already heavy traffic trucks and they have no trains so you're putting young children in cars get into uni against the tram dogs that are out there no accidents morbo jokes not just the clothes training this would save lives now this is meant to be built in subjects but it needs to be sent as big picture do it also looking horse that's the bread court development there is five and a half thousand privacy the bromines board at the top that such why no train station with a very small parking station depicted and a non-existent parking station of Douglass park surely this is a no brainer we need a train station with no to be needs two exits from Baltimore's Walter North will be demand blocked by the developers access to picton road is at least ten years away the only access buyer coverage area on enough access will be by the front row to and from the north for one of the south this would solve all the issues become the residence in both are the major safety issue also for the emergency services so at least from both sites that 21,000 cars and no money from either developers to improve the main roads let alone any of the work of us we have two bridges in the area there are one car at a time that's brought in class being willing to advocate and Douglas Park Drive wheel the clip age in Douglas Park Drive it's probably now and you're going to add twenty one thousand cars to the roads just through these two developments on and there's a big picture it's not just looking southeast and it's not just look north there's more coming so my question is do you have an the traffic lights to vote no innocence we have no current study to the impacts of transport we see no commitment to any infrastructure and transport please please go to straight hands up in the air and say it's too hard duck turn this area into another Hoxton Park and our public infrastructure must come first you have the chance to plan this is going to be as big as the talk is it must be a unified plan please look at the big picture and give us a kind of a crowd of not foresee of mouses just to give you a little bit of concept to the size was at this point in time VR has 600 houses is there needs to be in a future proof like that it doesn't become a legacy to us of this love the developers in Southeast development and from what I could see the unified builtin junction selection new team clean doesn't exist in all the older studies that we used and put forward to the state government or the original government was on the holistic whole the can't discount will turn north plenty agreement has been published talking about development contributions it says that it's based upon five thousand five and a half thousand properties however if you get that will you go don't you the Brad Court website in one page it says five and a half thousand homes and another so other there is it says it's 5400 notes you know but it also stated be the same flyer that there is a three and a half billion dollar investment in the North Precinct now with the five and a half thousand dollar loss that equates to in order to recover that a cost report that equates to the cost of lockup later than six hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars at cost and yet the proposal states that this is an affordable so the question I put to the council is hell's a block of land that will cost more than six thousand and six six hundred thirty six billion dollars to be considered for the past does this mean that the developer intends to increase the number and is still happening even Gehrig old men emeritus stated that this counted six hundred women recently their developers has taken the state government to court and wanted to seek permission to increase the amount of loss there is no there's no transparency of discussion that can give this structure instead in being our Court is getting increased that is my concern about the fancier things and also Wilson month developments every step we're talking about blue but in order to get the best returns of up to the developer there's no identically the transparency in sleaze we're all concerned about lack of detail the lack of any answers to our questions about previous individual submissions for themself based on September last year Muslims have made a fool of it's been hours we decided to pull our resources and start action group was in the Turner department plans apparent desire that developers and builders and ask the questions later decide there's no response to our latest submission for the warm up this year the submission big file the popular privately along with protection the largest city in this have 100 years and beyond the sky the court the current proposals as my colleague Stuart positive might have a possibly different when the heart concept will conjunction plan has presented just a few years ago 2012 we now have four developers who are talking to each other running around separate shows there was another Commission master plan and real is already about developments Walker grateful for planning to silver sauce to a Chinese develop Moscow enveloped has been on the console ever since the freeway was built in the nineteen eighties developers and speculative and the six and was once food on productive dairy farm land has been like a waste but now the entire McArthur on the city girl is redundant because going to sell its outdoor space without pedicure provision of drops of public transport the state government now proposes to cut a swath even further through the district we have known over for what to follow the hundred thousand new residents of Mother Nature and after two jobs that provide exists types of batteries critters are all this analysis I have drowning reports of sufficient we plan on setting up some research groups that focus on key areas maybe this is one be informed context I want to say this is a greenfield site as has been said by my colleagues this is an exploring opportunity something Picard to previous abilities respects the fragile environment in which it is located wagons short aims to ensure this new town is an innovative sustainable harmonious community we do not support the kind of dormitory suburbs and then we see the developers promise we don't eat without service infrastructure education and employment we're also a dedicated environment the switches are dynamic voices the gentlemen you sit like the Lost Colony we believe that greenfield site scalability presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity create a city for the future and suggest that an international design competition should be held as was done to Canberra in the early 20th century now my question given the council when pursuing various sections that the rezoning of southeast movement appeal and the whole new town develop re-examine building actually request counsel they say action why commissioning a full hydrological the will the new town projected population of 50 to 60,000 people allow impacts like factors like climate change and future mine closures on that critical limited water supply from the local dams to minor testing the claim by the grateful that they have a perpetual commercial agreement to hold the local mining what are the implications of this agreement the cost of houses to be good like in addition to the spirit mr. Sherr can counsel out right before on the campaign to have the proper tool for future models of those three in a lot of planks but he said Wells government and media personalities that will the bottom is all about affordable housing getting certain for developers about the real number of toxic houses and apartments they were ability given the current median price of the house that was now a hundred ninety four thousand my colleagues see aborted Pacific's customer we know that the New South Wales government formal benches housing is community and social housing although it comes people and parents and in terms of making me tell it wasn't use our affordable what initiatives what the council itself take to help jobs be created in the northern Utah I'm thinking here councils demand at the hostel the ariseth fear isn't the fastest growing sector for jobs it's only canonic strategy in 2015 and the jobs for the future strategy of August 2016 which is a partnership between the usos government private business Mecca Davis model that could be considered critical Natasha this presence can be yes answers satisfactory council report on council support finally to everyone you know will be another solace cookie-cutter develop no real art will consume the beautiful place it could be a model develop those people not profitable then you need to make the voice know in every way we can live an action group thanks council this opportunity to speak if you are Shannon see because like why is this like now included you know recently released policy planning agreement if there's no bother wise up there we don't want to mess water like that it's a public notice this light will be filled with water mains more theaters soon it do you want to be sitting around sipping coffee around that why have it at all who knew is going to be the cost of maintaining the waking Harrington part which is actually own storm water not waste water has blue-green algae and health warning signs all around it it has rubbish but again it has very druggies tights in the past each is speaking some places and the month absolutely stinks when the water level is like water would be want peace in afternoon the most recent documents the will the southeast is even more confusing it seems they don't know be plainly the wastewater treatment plant one where they keep the oysters kind of guns what is going on pest cooperation between the developers breaking down are we gonna end up to be four separate waste water plants so that no matter which way the wind blows the smallest inch will drift towards us when he's the partially treated by supporting to go any plans irrigated onto the undeveloped land is this still applies is this environmentally responsible being on the boundary of the water catchment and other systems on some of my rides over thought it's possible to shut I didn't see the pledges being before it stops now if they did their company that was for it too might not have singing but that does not mean that they might not be there we do not need to add more pollution to the assistance what happens during periods of rain if you're going to irrigate the undeveloped land the land is already wet what do you do with one of them it's obviously going to end up in those first two your decisions you just cannot have this poor plan you can't not plan for where the wastewater is going to go do you all a play by for more other submissions that we're going to deal with women good evening mayor councillors general manager yes immediately results one of the resident of Wilton business I'm president of the school mentor this street of our committee was president of the I have no club and that has been very good points race to my upon us ever five years including interactions from the wolf injunction community group many letters have been involved in the process this entire time it is also believed a public exhibition and had six propositions which I attended to the public sorry public has been adequately notified of all this on myself handed at 350 flyers and spoke to parents at the local school informing them of the Education Department were attending one of the drop-in sessions I believe why not supporting this development this will set back the built the future of Wilton five years and be detrimental to the labor community this is there is urgent needs for a public high school which is one Avenue a public school is Demi look near capacity sporting grounds soccer and we don't know we've got their polls and we don't even network quasi-newton an AFL rugby league union hotels motels restaurants industrial areas so business can operate and provide work for our local community trans might come to population growth so this needs to be stopped being a priority topic for the commitment commencement of this development I recently't even find a venue he will turn to hold a meeting as everything was closed on Monday nights and we have had the same problem going forth trying to find venues that are open after 6 p.m. in Wilton there will help 30 or 40 people the spire is already gone broke because the population is too low and other businesses are struggling due to the delays in the development you don't even start a business because there is no industrial area in the Wilton how is the employment initiative to council when you're slowing down a da process in the east area where that is industrial and available hurry this along will provide more employment to local community as you can see I'm heavily involved in the building area and the community and a majority of people that I speak to just want this very long the secret of the politics and the misleading information and just want to marry up get started I also find a personally insulting the councillors has recognized will matching group when you council have not engaged with any other will is the negative minority and they are far outweighed by the majority that wants to happen ASAP the only reason majority are not Luisi is because they're sick of hearing about it and just want the development to start thank you marriage counseling thank you on am Ibaka Reza I'm interested in the society in which camp and pretty simple in the absence of counsel in the decision-making process or rezoning Milton southeast and the development stipulations that have not been met as stated in your counsel at four why has the business paper not recommended the complete withdrawal of support for Upton in addition investigations and submissions particularly non-black written were an intelligent group in terms of environmental planning change to the in the water now the project is not meeting a number of planning principles set out under the objects of the greatest city commission and we interact and the original district plans these objectives are not adequately they event for the project previously just said there's already problems in water so they that's a testimony of full plan it's to growling the jobs and building the communities we don't have connectivity here we don't have a right system to manage our residents to employment women should not be the sacrificial land for attempting to prevent further development elsewhere in the shot when the development and outcomes are unsatisfactory to decision making there are a number of objectives and evening representing Commission Act and the APA act this way it should provide orderly development in the bright city region integrating social economic and environmental considerations with regard to the principles of ecological sustainable development simply promoting the alignment of government infrastructure decision-making the managers planning the key weakness of the wharton proposal to provide increased opportunity to public involvement and participation and environmental planning and the region today the disrespect for the council and community in terms of transportation making in regards to submissions that are made is that absolutely important they talk about a 30 minute access to a metropolitan center will that be achieved with a 50,000 population we have across transporters talks about training for city support for infrastructure do remember infrastructure system talks about resigned until after missing consistently council and justify solutions and I can change the structure to make changing these things up principles of addressing the Commission plans to which mutiny is part of that plan and is therefore on the registration with watch agreement cooks about health on choice and affordability one of student use like that portability it's a joke because they're protecting and enhancing push my affordability and also reducing carbon emissions and energy waste efficiently and you only talk about that work so I can say that they remember about planning criticism and objectives that are within the legislation that the problems would go away and continue because it is poor planning so my question to counsel is has the council reviewed as legal standing in respect to rating the for planning outcomes including section 3.11 bracket 2 of the AP NIH and let's do a pony please mmm and general manager councilís thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight strength of character behind everything it's offensive this is not really an argument against the development data in fact it took some more about getting students involved with the Koala seven separate roofing project what we need is a satisfactory outcome so I think it runs a great debt to not we are a service provider at college ball in different colleges a service provider we provide choice we in order to do that had to establish a business plan and we had to establish critical parts for the business plan it requires a financial plan and a child plan and then he asked work and then he don't spin of course to create a second campus we have based that on the fact that we will be surrounded by communication and cooperation and you can make a judgment as to how much that has happened it would plan allows for delay of course it does and asked us to but the delay of got to say is placing more pressure on the project it's my goal for satisfactory outcome but also avoiding further delay there is a messy established just speaking prominent in the school point of view this a messy plate established through at a city a satisfactory outcome woody for the delay we are will really in this place I've lived in so so I'm going to do these two things I'm going to write there is a petition that we have organized and it relates to the clauses and about protecting them so this petition will be a vital item airing that awkward white pipe envelopes that are available as well now we can't have these done on the Internet to actually be able to represent it in Parliament they need to actually be filled in so people can get their building and take some photocopy Netta Philippines distribute eminence in the fact that would be really really useful and the stock okay it's a little around I'm also going to in famous for community coming out tonight I'm actually gonna shoot the council they mean forward a little bit so that we can continue with the evening and you can say the outcome of the evening if you can distribute those petitions

Shai is rich in natural heritage which includes pants port creeks and rivers like this it also contains a bunch of Sydney's tricky water catchment it's important to understand the significance about waterways to the community and to manage and protect these into the future huang zhilie is experiencing increasing development growth which will impact the water quality and supply as well as by diversity in climate resilience therefore council would like to know what you value most about our local waterways your feedback will informs a level of protection given to our waterways and world conservation from the development of our integrated water management plan council has developed a few survey questions to help with this which are available on councils if you'll say a website the integrated water management policy will aim to drive smarter what a management outcomes including the following protecting the health of the aquatic ecosystems adding value to biodiversity flood and drought management community livability and recreation including swimming fishing and hiking we also aim to minimize the long term resource and cost burden on council the community and other stakeholders resilience we would love to have your feedback

hold a community event to highlight the importance of Allens great corridor I Lobby the state government to preserve this critical corridor can I have a second to play city councilor deep I'm gonna give each councilor an opportunity to speak to visit this evening but before I do I just need to make a couple of comments I really think community for your coming along attendance tonight and the interest that you've all taken I need to ask you a question up by national radio media person I'm being told that the people of ebony Wilton are busting to get affordable houses throughout the net we'll check the other show of hands who it's not busting to get it thank you I just hate to be out there representing you and saying something when somebody else knows you better than I do I would start with the state with the government made all the time and it's at no cost to government what about cost to our community I don't think I have ever been so passionate so angry about something as what is going at this point in time when world against go to Newtown we want will commute now we wanted to be fantastic we wanted to proceed and we will we've been asking many questions over and over again we're not getting any answers not only are we not getting any answers but things are making redzone just a hit of a hit of what we would say is a reasonable time we're not saying delay this thing forever we would these master planning done let's get it planned correctly so when what against it but we have to take this strong stance at this point in time because otherwise we're going to continue to not get any of the answers that we need that's Mullen Lilly we know we're already deprived and really the basic infrastructure that one would consider is essential living so close to Sydney you know phone access I don't know that our here there's not even good phone access no electrified rail my hospital a high school for less than a quarter of our students in the area and no touchie education also and we have no democratic representation as we now have a house so every time somebody writes to one of our counselors about a DA that's really worried in we have to say I'm really sorry but we as council council laws can no longer help you because now our Minister for planning has given us independent hearing pedals you know I really really get quite angry about this and these are the minister's at our Member of Parliament but there's someone else we have a national radio host it's roasting myself and council for one in infrastructure one in infrastructure for a city the size of Port Macquarie he's saying that it should go ahead and we all want a portable housing I have to add if you actually look at ABC media watch the same media gentlemen some years ago is paid to according to them was paid 250,000 per annum to work with them as a consultant this is someone who states you're Mary standing for pre-selection which is absolutely wrong or a lie no wonder his priests election he's worried about someone who states that the people about that will turn are crying out for affordable housing wrong as we just saw at least yummy people that came to like the people that were worried about it I challenge you to come I'm not going to get on his radio station where he can turn me off or turn me down or say whatever he wants but I tell them to come in and look but please come by public transport also talks about affordable housing how we need affordable housing and as we see the figures tonight nothing there is going to be affordable I'm sure and we give affordable house and we could take the place in the desert that nobody wants to be and we can give people free housing but what will happen to those people when they don't have the services when they don't have the transport when they can't get two jobs what will happen to them will that be the right thing for those people I don't believe so this is our community and it's not their community I have questions and none of them are big answer why has this been resigned prematurely on a Friday afternoon just before a council meeting that was going to address it at the same time we've got Allen Jones County one about it most state infrastructures being signed up when it would only take a couple of months to get it all sorted out and that's let's not forget the to avoid new development so they're going against their own advice and they're taking the report commissioned by the developers sorry question 2 and it relates being my horrid or because I think the whole thing is connected and talk about conspiracy theories I'm sure the whole thing's connected just to be able to let developers stamp over us with housing why is it that the endline corridor was avoiding all developers land and hitting up here and why did developers get to see the plans having any confidence before council in the community we just had an update from transport this evening before we came here and I have to tell you I haven't know any better answers to that well we ask the questions that that planning is M night corridor for 10 to 20 years and I said well the people of will wouldn't town will be built if you have your way by then why wouldn't you be planning for something where you actually know development is happening right now but I don't really have an answer they open this area up to development question 3 state government what state government consider to be affordable housing and what the city did the rezone land is going to be affordable housing I believe that it won't be much of it question 4 what will the limit of the number of houses be obviously it started off in this particular zone area that's been resided at 2600 and it went to three thousand in 3600 where the increase in the jobs where the jobs the first 2,600 and as we all know there's a new zoning at snap on a quasi that will allow more housing and when you actually wait when that was on exhibition that didn't exist so people that make submissions were mine to make submissions of the grounds of the new housing development zone that's in place now so I think it should be resumed with that question by where are the answers addressing not only council submission but those of the community people take a lot of time and effort to put in submissions other submissions take it on board part of the process to seem accountable so what to say I'm pretty strong and I don't want people sliding me and calling me at dough or I'm talented but it does hurt I'm giving you saying that says I won't be trying to just using the towel to wipe off the sweat so Alvin Jonah's changed his rant today to say that I'm no longer running for reelection and I'm running as an independent maybe that's a good idea you know this isn't me I don't have a right to have my photo on things you know what that's the mayor I do because I'm representing this area Muniz got a good idea and it's about getting our community a choice not him I think my counselors you'll find will probably be unanimous I'll be surprised if there's not this is not about me this is about our community and every counselor here with her to say about this tonight so I'm gonna hand this over to Mac do and it speech we can agree with a lot of your points that you raised if you have been following avid follower council you will have seen many many times that this council has spoken on the number of issues in Wilton not only that I think you if you've been watching for a long time you will see the consistency with which this council approaches the serious concerns and assuring that we want to to deliver a great community out of Wilton so just as none of you it's just a quick snapshot of one of those things that we're looking for it's one we actually want to provide a great community and we actually see Wilton as providing housing for Sidney's ground the needs we actually want to see quality jobs at a ratio of one job per house we want to see strong public transport links we want to see infrastructure delivered upfront with clear thresholds of accountability attached delivered through the land infrastructure plan we want to see our road network planned properly we want to see planning for health services to be has been consistent since 2011 2013 2015 and 2017 and now 2018 at all the points have we never wavered from what we desire for our community so the question is why are we striving for the betterment of our community some receive the face Facebook message and the Facebook message read that the railway will never come through Wilson picton road is getting upgraded you cannot stop development or amended perhaps that comment is right but should that stop us from striving what we believe to be the best possible outcome for our community we deserve to know how our community's going to be impacted and how will be it won't be disadvantaged due to poor planning I hope the arguments tonight that we should just get on and builded don't delay any longer I think that we can all agree that we very much want to get on with the job but at what cost what will be the cost to our community the New South Wales government gets this wrong what will be the best possible outcome for we're talking about southern are will be here for decades and decades to come I personally don't want to see Wilton destined to become a substandard satellite suburb of character where our only hope for connectivity is sitting in congestion and a lack of opportunity for our children our children shouldn't have to settle for affordable housing with city with no infrastructure no public transport and no jobs what is wrong with taking a little bit more time to get this right so whoever we are we as a council do not have any skip game we've been cut out of the decision-making process and to make things worse the rezoning process has been structured in a way that I've learned what can council be involved in any amendments and we'll have looted involvement in even drafting the development control plan our submissions to date have been ignored and no responsibly received by any government department we have have countless opportunities for consultation and feedback the community is tired and frustrated and none of none of any of the consultation has even been answered or considered so snapshot of one the rezoning in southeast a couple of key points up no amendments or explanations being given to the communities about their submissions no state infrastructure plan is in place to ensure the right infrastructure is provided at the right time no funding agreement is in place with for community infrastructure by a voluntary planning agreement not a single response from the partner to counsel about the number of unresolved issues with the overall plaintiff or Wilson and the ruling for southeast precinct an increase in housing Disney and dwellings to 3600 and increase in expect a expected population to 9600 just in this one precinct a decrease in the size of the public school that is to be provided to maximize an increase of dwellings a lack of jobs for the population and woefully short of counselors bowl of one job per house a basic bus service with no passenger rail will be provided with no agreement to who will fund it up to the developers leave a urban development zone which has not been exhibited and has now been added and will allow flexible zonings and an increase in across the entire site on the edge of an opinion agree that has not even been resolved we are also kicking the can down the road on a number of other issues in particular our koalas council staff will need to consider the controls from the state Environment Planning Policy amendments in 2008 2018 in this regard applause six point two arranges for the designated state of public infrastructure states that development consent must not be granted for the subdivision of land and urban release areas if the subdivision would create a lot smaller than the minimum lot size to get it on the land immediately before the land became or became in heart an urban release area unless the Planning Secretary is certified in writing to the consent authority have been made to contribute to the provision of designated state public infrastructure and in relation to that all so what does that mean that means that this cannot go ahead until the seat has been resolved we don't have a seat how possibly can we proceed this is kicking the can down to the do stage and making of the Allen Street corridor which you've seen in the presentation tonight and in council's opinion the evidence from our save our species program and previous reports suggest that the area's core habitats and defined by step 44 and if this rezoning was run like molander the council 744 would dictate that council could not approve the proposal until the comprehensive koala planet management was prepared prior to the finalization of the rezoning this hasn't happened for this rezoning these processes it stands defers the conversation to the development application phase and what this means is that council will have to fight which means it goes to the land and I report it ultimately costs ratepayers rather than an issue being resolved prior between the developers and the state New South Wales state government therefore a direct social impact cost is incurred by our community council wants to see this the development of a South Western Sydney conservation strategy and clearly Wilton and the rezoning of any development be deferred until a comprehensive quality management is prepared and secures the corridors the argument needs to be or whether we stay outside the tent I think you will all agree that we have been inside the tent but a number of years now I haven't seen a single piece of evidence any piece of Correspondence from the department planning or the New South Wales state government that has made any commitment or has considered anything that the council has raised that we can share with our community that has been provided I think that the time has come that we need to think about our position outside of the team we have had a strong advocacy campaign that has had a far more impact and actually delivered more results than if we continue to be inside the tent working with a plan the other issue which is the elephant in the room is that we have the front-runner in the Liberal Prince lecture of Matt Smith who's previously a counselor on Concord Council we now is insane Suzy has had failed attempts to parachute into other safe liberal states and most importantly he is a staff up to the Minister of Planning near us safe seated while on duty to oversee the development of our party not only know the links to his former past and Department of Planning strike me as a clear conflict of interest in representing our community I would suggest the Minister of Planning and the factions driving this agenda need to stop playing games with the placement that we live we need someone that represents our community and our home at the end of the day we need to ask the question what legacy will we leave behind are we happy to stand by our decision to support the development as it stands what will that look like in 20 30 and 50 years time if not why would we consider it now I was once of optimistic that all stakeholders could build a city that we could all be proud of after all is said and done actually Fiona's summed it up really well and I've actually said it before it is our community not the developers the Department of Planning or the politicians that will pay the ultimate price for poorly implemented and rushed decisions Winston Churchill what is the use of living if it is not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who believe in it after many councils that want to speak against the motion Percy no I have to count slideshow I just pass the line for fight to be impudent negative you just say what you need to say very well firstly thank you everybody for coming tonight so really be attended well though it's a great bit of dispute though by the mirror the council of death and I think it's a really good emotion that we've got up and I just want the best feel a little bit differently talk about 4 of the issues that I feel are embedded in the report traffic was was mentioned before by a couple of speakers if by anonymous highlights you just go of the 3600 developments there is an average of 7 traffic movements per day from a high see--look yeah 20,000 it's ok maybe the 3,000 homes will take some time to come would you got the wait at least one as well which would basically triple in development would say our own partners vision before I still work we all know what's bad and the right house but if we don't jump up and down now we're going to get another old road out here clearly last Friday I have missed a few people this is from my spots on earth so to speak I was trying to beat didn't go through go through Wilton to head out down to water god it took four traffic light movements that gets through those intersections ahead fire at five o'clock and I nearly got to stop in the middle in the bus so you and all this is extra development clearly we've got potentially a Narellan driver Kevin belly white and you cannot have that sadly pretty good once the developments fully go probably have two traffic lights on the other side and up the to their existing there and one that I'm turning into olive will turn perhaps won't want it further down the plea of MacArthur bad that might be clearly infrastructure needs to come first the cultural things has got to change where with infrastructures not at the end it's at the beginning there happens in other states I don't know why the last part we have any vision with it the structure was probably when the hard the other one is really quite remarkable of my interest of my sister koalas and I think Damien for Israel's wooden vessel as an employee but I particularly affect the the community groups they're out there constantly send me almost twice a week we see a dead or other social media and those good people they go out and they try save them etc we've got a genie to do that okay so everyone talk about this more but the first is what the European quality was very close to here so we have a G to do that and I appeal to the young the walkers developers that they not bad people right that they like live their development but I asked them police to reconsider developing in a koala habitat to not money not develop in that koala habitat area the other one of course is is public transport was basically non-existent in Ayrshire we don't even have a street train service from PETA like the misspoke earlier about we had a presentation from about the airline and the general manager of camera channels anyway Marvie comedy at the moment of the car parks at the stations at Campbelltown that's basically growing MacArthur capital town lmao I think it was 65% of people apartment I'm not careful Catholic therefore waterlily or gender or whatever right so where are all the good people from Eve got to go they're going to go apart I over it over there so it's going to be yeah terrible for people to get to work with sanity 70% of em off our shark travel is very shy the last one I want to talk about was what you see is what you don't get so to speak right I remember it was there when we approved the big our government we didn't know about it actually my son wonderful people in there but they got approval for could be a few numbers out a couple of developers meals like correct me there's eleven hundred and twenty five Lots right well it's going to a lien hundred Lots developer a she took out at the port was a comment before this council we got down like a dinner but that's what we wanted the message that you know remained completely consistent we haven't_''_2040.28 said anything different really than what we were saying months ago and then brought many of us on counsel counsel before us you know I thought Department website and I've been up this been looking through it and I look at the issues that they had picked up they picked up on in high school capacity and I commend dr. Colombian and education withstanding ingredie to step in and provide a high school and then I'm concerned about transport well it's a little bit of a no-brainer they point out that the bus route runs through the precinct we actually set it on 15 minutes to Roger station ruining brianna and also it would be reference to all public transport meant about walking in off-road cycling as I mentioned so technology design a new at the end of the day if people have to fix things you want to build things we made the capacity to educate you know the next generation of Engineers and tradespeople I think the conversation you're gonna give few different things to obviously hood the cool we wish you were with you to try and get a great generation opportunity to get this right and there's a lot of very very passionate good working people within canceled that are striving for exactly the same things usually the only infrastructure came with now you could upgrade with me all right Victor Rudd Minister the demon 3x range to get my wife Esther in Port Isaac believe more traffic with this countdown finished leaked to me cancel them on board as long as it's done the right way I'm going to happen eight years ago with my I believe that the small communities you learn respect ten people a lot more friendlier than I see visit if we don't beat happens develop sit down we have a little belly and I think it's the entire community members of the people that's that the balance is happening I'm sure probably happy to be guarded but every time you jealous together so I'm supportive of small development not part of our present as it's in one piece and uh Loretta Bremen is local people local daycare people local shop kids here and yes we do need development to keep all those things going in people shotgun it is sad about the spa that services didn't do so well but news ever but it doesn't want house it's about that sort of sustainable to their craft box they don't kids okay from the community the infrastructure reading room again and see that the local the killed local artist and whether the room anymore carts the rotary the owners picked in road you might happen right notorious fatal car accidents and more cars on the road what we're doing is making volunteers go ahead there anytime and deal with the trauma of that and when I'll take that into account either it makes me look bad now the koalas funny enough I was driving out of the deed from Pete Sentinel and the NRMA had it was in the radio started with a koala that remember he came to death we had all our memories of koala and I'll see even Wilder so it's pretty tricky but it's obviously they're a hot coffee outlet and then what we can do to help them be sustainable and keep breathing and and become part of our community together the counsel attaches in media in the application including phones being a professional well you're right we just agree with needs to go we were not being listened to this is for you to ask questions without counsel support we noticed I've got a roll over the top of us but we're asking that we're begging them to history of New South Wales that never done it they've never got this is a brand new canvas to work and I respect every speaker his right and I was particularly impressed by Clinton Whitman where everyone I think that to stand up and to try to put a country into us because that was well done he supported his decision well the digital crown and the community respected that position as well I could just add that though the singer of the and the group that do believe that we should just play ahead and trusting God this is going to work out well it's nonsense it never has but we're to these questions we will get the netball courts will get everything that we want the bad planning resulted in not having their ball courts in Lucy bad planning causes a small business to go there this is good plan we're asking the right questions and other solutions then we are a supporter and we'll call another soft it's got a lot of amendments at this as well riding on the council written citizens position number eleven in bar urgently the Department of Planning and minister of planning to discuss Kansas position and work on a strategy to resolve council and the community's concerns so I can move from yes onto it my man's coming to the gym a anyways so he can assess what responds with class and we can make a judgement I've always been supportive of Wilton Junction right walk when they get government a lot of the studies faculty was too doesn't live in not available what about a little back then is what they were yeah we did that bail for the general magic you guys the primacy really as well is inherent beginning as well so there's there's a lot of history weeds with injunction Chelsea in saying that this is that we the people largest racial town in your several miles and that is exciting on its part there and excited me to be part of that journey as well so there are a lot of positives to be gained from this nice meeting new town can get a speedy response from the others the department and other ministers certainly we've got better to be held up and there's some of the speakers rightly said schools incredibly important and therefore the capacity and we do have a white board where we've got independent school that's ready to move off and and almost immediately so the sooner that these issues can be resolved but the benefit and they must be mostly devastated and covered as out of the D key points but I suppose I'm one of the many of the new councils the meanest certainly since I've been on council we've been negotiating faithfully both Department planning and the developers to try to deliver and I don't think what we've been asking for as a great town is actually really mean that much I mean we've been asking the basic things like jobs into destruction yeah that's not a huge hours kind of thing if we're going to have birth we've always been told that you have a the earth comes to services social contract really to the the developers actually provided a government provide the things that they said would be provided as also to this we've had the audacity to demand the development comes up with appropriate services and facilities and as a result of that and yet we begin the step down it's becoming very sadly it's become very clear that the developers in the department planning and love indigo she ain't good faith to be sure I'm sick of everything was they really only began after cramming in as many people as that possibly can without solutely mara God's the quality of life the people who live there oh the environmental devastation before they get through this process we've got one chance to get this thing right but one opportunity to do it properly if we get it wrong we're gonna end up at on the pod and we got the message irons are now trying to retrofit right into our pot it's costing them billions of dollars that they would have had to spend if that take the first developing right Canyon cookie cutter houses through the whole thing and the community of the monster suffer and terms for change my picks in this after the fact they've been really decent generous with this is what I decided we had a meeting with some fairly senior planning people a month or so ago and at no point did they mention in there that this was coming we have staff that were caught off guard when they were ready to make anything for dimension and that's gets turned on us they haven't been negotiating inside they've been looking out that develop do I expand that's not council and the community has been asking for anything unreasonable here holders and it's a bit stunning that the main circle is to insist on basic infrastructure for our community well because it said they're attacked up on the math because one who make sure they've got some basic stuff at the moment there are six to eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-four houses he wanted Lee that's the size of building will end up they hasn't it'll be the guy so what we're saying is that's the equivalent of putting every car that there is in the shire on the in my way and I'll be every day hey everything is there now take every car in the entire shot that is gonna be a bulletin if they don't get this right and I should have no intrusive right despite counsel I've seen again and again and again you know this about the community let's do the right thing you know we have no opportunity to get this right the rent wait mocking now these gentlemen where it where will these people gonna how are they going to get there the it's just absolute insanity not to have right and we not insisting everyone has to be there now we're saying has to include plans right you can't film the town the size of local quarry and go yet good luck I'm picky right under the hew my way off you you on your merry way well it's doing is entrenching back because it's a desperate to get a foot in the pocket that they'll accept services that frankly the state government should be ashamed all that they're willing to do that the other really big issue they've got it's the only committee of three population in New South Wales the oh he hates identify the importance and significant of the islands red coral that record is suspiciously disappeared they initially recommended that they needed to protect the entirety of the corridor the corridor is now but managed to be reduced down to one hundred meters and that hundred made a car door will be further reduced when they widened intro so you're taking the most important corridor for the long-term viability of koalas in the Shire and absolutely ripping it apart purely so that the developed my house is amazing they don't need to announce instead there are thousands and thousands of house coming in they could quite easily have known from there and protected discreetly important Cardinal but they didn't I also find it very interesting there was some changes made that does it has a much bigger focus on the strategic outlook and it looks at things like corridors for wildlife movement at the moment in volatility it doesn't apply we're in the transition and it's kind of becoming you know that the next few months that the city came he finds it very interesting that it's been the the rezoning here at Wilton has been pushed through before it's not applying here it seems an awfully convenient timing I also find it really interesting that if this was council considering it as council did say there would be a comprehensive plan of management for the koalas we don't have one it's been kicked the Ken's been kicked down the road it'll be done at the next act will be done there and yeah I'm quite sure that there would be a consultant family the result that they want despite the fact now eh identify how important this is but there's really something not right here the way I take my role as a council that really seriously I we're entrusted by its communities to protect what makes the show so special like I can't sit idly by anymore as a greedy developer because of nothing about nothing cares about nothing except maximizing their bottom line grapes and pillages some of the most important in critical while a habitat and entrenches disadvantage for whole generation of residents I didn't embedded vodka insist upon planning the developers in the state government had shown an urgent desire to make one a great town they just doing the absolute baby man they can take it most competitive service given that's the case we've got to move to the marinade or lotion if they're not going to give us the basic facilities that we need to make this work then I'm not willing to put my name to it and the counter shouldn't and the community just a few comments before we vote interestingly enough when we had a commissioner originally from the greater Sydney Commission they used Oran Park as a photo of what we shouldn't look like they used it as an a judgement now we actually have an appointment with the Department of Planning tomorrow and we'll be taking this resolution into them we will obviously we won't_''_3290.41 we'll turn to go ahead it'd be a great view chair but the question is what if and I guess the body is that council withdraws it in principle support until these issues have been looked at as community you need to get onto our website as a website what part of the web sites engage while and Lily if you put your details there we will be updating that with any messages as we go along you need to know that all your councilors are in this together so I guess you're probably authors don't use me and as I'm talented as me I'm sure we're going to spray tomorrow but you know what the powerful change cultural community I think the messages wall underling will not be stopped on through the m93 bed mining it will we just I don't know what's going on it just doesn't make any will you have either have wilton a great new town or will have no channel at all so I'll put that two councils the motion is oh just clarify do we need to clarify anyway it's all done yep I'll put the motion all those in favor aye and it's carried unanimously so thank you all for attending this evening as I said get on to engage volunteer so that you get updated as we go along I'm sure this yep get your petitions please send those even for us about koalas and about the raise ID and I'm sure the great city yeah I bet you you are or what your opinion is would love to have you help them get a bright new town thank you very much and have a good evening on the site

Hi I'm Judy Hannon the marijuana and early Shire Council today I'm out on a site at Wilton where we're going to have a town the size of Port Macquarie with 50,000 people living here the government talked about the agreement and the deal that they have in place the problem is that that deal has only been done with the developers it's certainly not been done with the community and it's not been signed off how do we have surety that we're going to get the things to make this a great community we actually have no guarantee of how we're going to give public transport to our community they're talking about buses but buses to where we actually have no electrification of rail and for 50,000 people that's exactly what we need a really good public transport system people talk about a 30 minute city well I'm not sure where you can get in 30 minutes from here so we need jobs on-site and we have no surety of where those jobs are coming from have other concerns families here mums and children and we have no surety of where actually we're going to have a health precinct so how can you live somewhere and not know you're going to get those services we have a koala population here in fact the only population in New South Wales that's chlamydia disease-free and right through where they travel we're going to have housing development there has to be a plan to protect our koalas we're calling our community to come on board and help us we're asking you to have a look at the council's website and there's a portion they're called engage while in Delhi please log on there and help us to help you help us to make Wilton a great new town thank you
G'day everybody and welcome to the may council meeting wrap up it was big night with lots to discuss following on from a very busy weekend with the hugely successful illuminate and thank you all the staff that were assisted with that one we couldn't have done it without you one of the things we talked about was managing growth in a our area is actually a really big challenge and we looked at the minimum lot size for the construction of dual occupancies and we've asked for a bit more information to just to clarify a few question marks that we've got we also discussed the possibility of a water park in Welland early again the challenge came around the ongoing maintenance costs which was roughly about 250,000 for our facility so once again that's something that we've got to really think through with our budgets so we've asked for some a bit more information we're going to come back to it traffic community there were two recommendations around our local schools including upgrade of Wonga road and around picton high also made some changes to the guidelines and membership of the tourism community Advisory Committee which is great and we are also be writing to Sydney water to us for some updates on water restrictions as you know our down to 30% there were also quite a few notice emotions so that were radius they were also including writing to our local member regarding the more than 20% increase in our emergency services levy we agree that it's really important for our rural fire services to have that coverage but it was lumped on us at the last minute and we're struggling to find the money at this stage so once again we want our stake to really work with us on that we're also looking at ways to resource and support small business in the area we've taken a huge number of steps in that area but we need to do more we're looking at continuing to advocate on transport issues especially rail and if you'd like any more information about what happened at councils meeting on Monday night you can jump online look at the the footage from the night as well so thank you everybody and see you next time
Hello and welcome I'm for a guard as the New South Wales Minister for women I am pleased to present the following documentary on women in non-traditional trades it's true that women's legal rights and social opportunities have grown over the last four decades equal pay anti-discrimination and maternity leave laws specialised services for women and changes in society's values have all played a part in creating a more equal society in New South Wales however there are still areas where the outcomes for girls and women are poorer than for boys and men women's employment potential is one of the great untapped resources for New South Wales historically women have chosen jobs from a narrow field of options industries that employ high levels of trades people such as mining and construction are experiencing growth we need to harness this growth and the skill shortages that come with it as an opportunity to support women and girls to enter these industries and careers as minister for women I want to see more women take up a non-traditional trade as we know women have traditionally made historically these have often been low paid I want girls at school and women changing careers or re-entering the workforce to realize you have more options to choose from for girls and women watching this documentary my hope is a Jubal consider careers in a much wider range of fields such as plumbers electricians carpenters signwriters motor mechanics worlders and painters this is only a small taste of the world of options available to you the new south wales government has committed to increasing the number of women in non-traditional trades by 2021 increasing the number of women and girls entering these jobs will result in a more productive labor force and in turn allow women to be engaged in interesting and rewarding work that's also higher paid I hope you enjoy the stories of for vibrant women who have chosen unique and fulfilling careers in non-traditional trades and supportive families and employers that have made a difference for these women I trust their stories will inspire you girls don't want to do it in a way like some girls they just want to stick with the flow you want to call that because they're afraid what people might think some of you girls like might want to do it but there's so much stuff going around and saying they can't_``_158.56 do it or they're not supposed to be some girls might be like oh yeah I really want to do this but then they hear a bunch of boys saying no girls can't_''_166.69 do this they can't do that so they don't do it because they think that they're not supposed to so I think or not I can't_''_173.44 so they could do something else that's more girlish they wanna fit in support sense of humor confidence and brave it was an unusual step for a girl to take and I knew was no others around that I knew of but I could sort of ask so that was it she was on her own I had personal doubts that did that she was doing the right thing women are very ambitious when they get the opportunity when I was at school I originally wanted to be to choose our electives and I chose metalwork automotive thinking I could probably get in and do a couple of lawn mower engines and when I started my class teacher got us to a bit of welding with an oxy-acetylene welder and I loved it and from that point he told me to go to TAFE and do a thermal welding cutting and MIG welding course so I went and did that and absolutely adored it some of the difficulties of coming into such a male dominated trade really it was the fact that none of that I was the only girl and coming into a male area I needed to accept the fact that no one was going to change because I'll tee off some of the things that I personally found difficult was the couple of sexist remarks why are you can't_''_291.11 do that because you're a girl you can't but you can't lift that you can't do this you can't_''_298.01 do that well you can and it takes a bit of effort like anything does but you can get through also help to lift something do if you can't do something don't push yourself and hurt yourself just to prove a point if you can't do it ask for help I'm not weird I love metal work I love my job and I do have a boyfriend and I do have a normal life in outside of work I don't dress like a man all the time I I do on the weekends and if I had my if I have to go out I do dress up and look like a girl and people think that just because you're in a man's job that you're going to be manly and that's not true you might have a few more muscles than most girls and has my bear beat rafa but it's all part of it proud as punch over couldn't be prouder she please well she had two big big head now if I say too much more she's a qualified boilermaker she's qualified draftsman so it looks like she's done the right thing he she can do what she likes nail you know I meant she did the world's at a fate they're screaming for blasted artisans and she's got that behind her and she's still only 22 0 means he's got the world at her feet she do what she likes when she likes hell she likes I love mostly getting a pile of steel and that is rusty like you can see around here and turning in to turn it into something you have a pile of steel and then you turn it into something of use something that makes something else work it's the fact it I like making my wells incredibly shiny I don't know if that's just because I'm a girl but I like making things look beautiful after I've made them it's a point of pride a lot of girls as well get students with like a different career like say I know like your mum would more like you to do I'm hairdressing or beautician or something like that when like they kind of see to do what you like but I kind of think that your parents stay in a different way well when I leave school I want to continue on with the fitting machining that I do now I want to hopefully get an apprenticeship out of it and everything else to do with that and I absolutely adore it I want to build Polly's chopper bikes or build cars and stuff and help repair cars like in a body shop um yeah I just love to work on Harley's to do bowling the frames the tanks everything I love to do that enthusiasm willing to take on a challenge and passion Laura was always a bit of a tomboy I suppose she's always sort of been an outdoor ish kind of a person there seemed to be a lot more opportunities for females nowadays than what there was year years ago in all sorts of trades and I think the girls are really out there getting into it now I was interested in taking on a career in horticulture because I love being outdoors I enjoy a bit that I could really get a challenge with so for three years I went to TAFE and I was pretty much the only girl in my class some girls came and went but they never really stuck it out so it was a bit of a challenge to prove the other boys in my class that I could do it they doubted my knowledge and ability to undertake the physical activity but at the end of the day at the end of the course I topped the class I received highest achiever in the course so I really proved them wrong Lauren won the my gateways Apprentice of the year she also got the new south wales Apprentice of the year for her field she won several leadership programs Awards got the opportunities you to meet the Prime Minister in the governor-general there was several things that she got she won during her apprenticeship she was just amazing I think if inside that person is are the capabilities to do something I don't see why anyone would persuade them not to give it a go I just I really um at the beginning I found that all of the uniform was made for men they didn't actually supply women's uniform so for a while there I was wearing men's clothes baggy men's clothes having a trade background was really the key thing to getting my cadetship in city parks management I think having the practical experience really put me above the rest of the applicants building upon my background in horticulture I went into city parks management and since then I've kind of had a bit of a change of focus into recreation planning in local government and this involves things like planning for playgrounds parks our beaches leisure centres and golf course now I'm involved in great projects like building a playground for children and it's a really pleasing experience to go through the process of consulting with children to come up with a design that they really enjoy you oh boy that seen my class that he wants to be a hairdresser hmm he cuts his own hair so and it it always looks really nice and he cuts other asked for a haircut he'll go sure come over you know and he'll cut it and it looks it actually turns out really really nice and he has no training at all it's the same guys as well like if they wanna be here dress I think they'll cut a little bit more stuff like off the guys as well saying why do you want to be hairdresser for like it's girls draw why doing that it's like a service like it's like Aspen I do immense job yeah against it being your girl you won't be able to do it but it'd be good to like show them up and say yes I can get it done yeah that's just my to be strong confident and most importantly to be yourself after school when we go to the shopping center everyone just like stairs and points because my mom has black paint all over and has it paint clothes on but I just can I just ignore it because my mum is a Peter whilst I was at school a builder or a painter so I kept asking and asking and the answer was always no so I did that nursing because that was easy to get into it was a female thing to do and then in real estate and it wasn't until I saw across the road that the builders were there that it renewed my passion to to be where I truly wanted to be and so much to my surprise I asked they a painter through a friend of mine and he said yes so just by keep knocking on that door and never giving up on who you really are and the passion on a career that you want to do it proved out to be rewarding and I've never looked back since and that was 14 years ago to the point now where I run my own company and looking to expand to help other girls pursue their dreams and so my advice is never give up again keep knocking on that door because it worked for me and it's been great I'm still irregular marshes she fixing stuff with that homework and she said when we need her over my time as a female painter I've had had some hard times where mainly with daughters where they're not exposed to having a girl on the job and they haven't been the best to work where they've made it quite hard so to overcome that instead of showing them that I've been upset by it I've just turned up on the job every day and and that's annoyed them a bit more and proving to them that a girl is quite capable of doing the job and can do it properly and I find that they they respect that the end of the day and I've changed someone's opinion on having a girl on the job I just love what I do I couldn't think of doing anything else my advice is the parents with young girls that are thinking about entering the trade is to encourage them and give them a go my friends think it's really cool that reminds a painter and decorator and I think else because she loves what she does and yeah I love the fact that you get to give a house another story another chapter in life especially in historic restorations you can bring it back to life and and create this new chapter for the new owners and create a lot more color and exuberance to the to the property and it gives me great joy in seeing the client and their joy in renewing their home because that's their passion it's the biggest investment they make in their life is their own home and I get that chance to to make a difference in the way that home reflect their personality and bringing it back to life that's my passion my best friend has a passion for would work um she goes to this school she absolutely loved can she loved like not really metal but more the wood based ones so she right now she's doing our woodwork and construction and she absolutely adores those subjects so she's gotten to the point in her life where she has decided to make a career like you have to make you small little projects her mom gets like she brings it home and her mom just has the biggest smile on her face like she's really proud of what a daughter's accomplished and its really it's cute it is cute boys long as you love it you can do it determined thick-skinned sense of humor when Amy first started for my shoes cashier and she she just talks me you know how do you make so she's had he do this had to hear that size at all coming out the back and I'll show you how to do it and I shot her and she done it and I thought she's not too bad at this and I thought you know and then she kept jogging around we kept saying something about apprenticeship an apprenticeship him and the wife and I we've got to get on how to talk and we decided that was like a four-year trade-ins full years we have to put her on four and we did and come out Dante me never seen won the lottery or something that's a fitting that was excellent man I'm a butcher I finished my trade last year in February so just over a year and a half I suppose being butcher I've been working at the shop since I was 16 so it was ten years ago I started as a wash up kid cashier and I just had a lot of interest in the subject so my boss eventually decided to offer me an apprenticeship so that took four years and I ended up topping my class overall so that was really cool there was one other girl in my class of about twenty I suppose and she ended up dropping out after about a month or so so that made me the only one and it's two and a half years of theory and the rest is practical to learn actually how to cut the meat and do all that sort of stuff so pretty intense but it's good it's quite interesting well I've had I've had three apprentices since I've been in this shop's been equally as good as the other two and it all the same there's no difference between either and when say one was better than yellow but it's no reason why a female can't_''_1142.279 do just as good as job as a mile in the butchering business you know so this it's funny because people walk in the shop as I you know and that they all say gonna excuse me can I talk to the butcher and and then I come out and I said well she use a butcher he has got a certificate to say she is a butcher and she can suggest to you exactly what I can suggest you and and in people do and have got used to it man most people are just amazed when they may find out that she's a butcher and she's wearing a knife she cuts made up on a sore and it is probably it is I do a lot of people but to me it's just a name it's his part of their job daily job huh it I'm I compare of her attention which is all but when I told my dad that I wanted to be a butcher he was quite happy because we have a few butchers in our family anyway no females but they sort of he wanted me to just do the best I could do anything I wanted to try out so that's pretty much what I did I've had a few people come into the shop and have a bit of a giggle when they've seen a female butcher there's also been times when people would rather the male's serve them because they didn't think that I could do it properly but now because I've been there for so long and I know most of the people there more happy for me to do it because they realize that I can now so it's not so much of a big deal anymore if you're a parent that has a daughter that wants to go into a trade the best thing you can do is support them because they'll have something with other people I was very shy when I started working here and it's really brought me out of my shell and it's made me a lot more confident to talk to people and joke around and in yeah just interact with people it's it's fun because I live around here and um most of the people I already knew anyway so it's good to see them every day and have fun at work if it's something that you truly love don't let anything stand in your way because that is how people end up with these lives that they aren't happy with if you love it then you just do it for other girls considering a trade I say go for it it's a great opportunity you get to meet lots of people and you end up with papers at the end so at least you'll have a career to fall back on if you choose to do something else most importantly never give up if people keep knocking on your back keep knocking on that door because one pursue it you'll be amazed how much support you do get once you're actually in the role in undertaking the work so we need to be stubborn drung minded and self believing I want to do something that's going to be good for me in the long run and put me somewhere where I want to be in the future I often feel a sense of exhilaration when I see young women working in non-traditional trades I think to myself wow that is such an achievement good honor and how hard must have been to do something different to what society expected it's not that long ago when we wondered if women could do the same work role as men quest questions such as how would they cope what would people think of them can women really do it such perceptions are based on the updated view that gender has a bearing on a person's capacity to successfully perform the work of certain jobs the greatest barriers for women in non-traditional occupations and those considering taking up these occupations are the stereotypes imposed by others I hope this DVD will inspire young women to consider their futures to think broadly and boldly about the career paths open to them and more importantly to follow their dreams you
 welcome to the wall and le Shire a little-known but amazing destination to visit and an even better place to live work and invest Roland Alicia is blessed with vast environmental and cultural resources our assets extend from food production manufacturing and an established mineral resource industry through two iconic water catchment dams such as Warragamba dam indigenous culture and natural bushland our rural landscapes and proximity to Sydney Wollongong and Canberra make us the perfect location for business including agribusiness and tourism located in easy traveling distance to the new Western Sydney Airport we are in a very unique position and we would welcome you to take a closer look as part of the greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area our ecological environment native fauna and river systems lend themselves to agricultural ecological and adventure tourism Wallen Billy is also home to many unique and diverse events and festivals and a thriving cafe culture this is a time of unprecedented growth for the area with major new developments underway at Wilton and across many parts of the Shire such as the towns of Tama and apon investment in for job creation increased infrastructure and access to all levels of education and diverse medical services our vision as a council is to create opportunities in partnership with the community business and government to promote livability productivity connectivity and a sustainable future at Wallin le Shire Council we are committed to embracing opportunities and at the same time building on the incredible sense of community that makes this place so special we make approximately 500 to 600 thousand litres of apple juice a year we grow necrons peaches apples in person we have a fourth-generation farm and I see a great future I loved the way the community pulls together I love being my own boss born and bred in Sydney have worked there all my life I just needed a change and found this opportunity and took it the less traffic quietness and the people very easygoing slower pace than Sydney that's all the space you want there's room for the kids to run around it's close to the city it's close to the country it's got everything you need I often joke with over CD purchases than the decision to come and move to the wall and early I decided to move to picton after spending just one day here now I've never regretted that the Farrelly family got here at 1855 and from every ever since we've been daring and beef cattle and timber and vegetables we employ about 25 people so that's supporting 25 families and we employ as many locals as we can we're only an hour and a bit from Sydney we're 40 minutes from Wollongong we're 40 minutes from Beryl and there's just so much to do in the wall in Delhi but the great little towns but we've also got the nature areas there's always someone to chat to there's always someone you know friendly people you won't want to move anywhere else you won't want to be anywhere else and this is the best place to drink beer but it's the best beer in you South Wales the whole areas grown substantially so these big potential for us to do and grow a back so I encourage you to come and to take a closer look you
Walland Dilli covers an area of 2560 square kilometers with over 800 kilometers of sealed and unsealed roads the same distance from Sydney to Melbourne these roads are constructed and maintained by one and dalish AIA Council and funded by Wallander Lee ratepayers with help from the state and federal governments the lifetime of a road depends on wear and tear both from the elements and traffic over time potholes develop due to water getting into the road and maintenance is needed to stop the holes getting bigger and becoming a major traffic hazard if a pothole is not filled and sealed it will deteriorate rapidly previously all potholes were repaired manually with Asheville this process was done by teams of council employees the process is more expensive time-consuming more of a safety issue and repair is not as waterproof as the current method of spray sealing both methods are used depending on the situation the paid line sealing truck or jet patcher as it is commonly known fills minor potholes with the mixture of emulsion and aggregate this is done via the front snorkel it can also treat larger truck spray selling by this truck has been great for woollen deli without it our teams could not keep up repairing potholes using the old manual system we have 800 kilometres of roads to maintain each team could only repair between 15 and 100 potholes per day depending upon the size of the holes where spray sealing has allowed us to repair próxima 300 potholes safely per day this means we can get to the potholes earlier which ensures a greater safety on arrows once a pothole is repaired it can take up to a day for the patch to settle down and any excess or loose stones to disperse the seal is very effective in most situations where a quick response is required the jack patcher is cost-effective without it road maintenance and Woland Dilli would slow down considerably at Council we are always looking at ways of saving our rate payers money the check patch has helped us do that please report potholes as soon as you notice them so we can arrange repairs each day thousands of cars travel on wall and Dilli roads and the jet
Hey everybody and welcome to the council wrap-up if you tuned in last night and stuck with us you wouldn't have been getting into bed until well over midnight but just a couple of updates for you the Macquarie Dale Road and planning proposal actually was not supported on the night due to a number of issues around infrastructure and p-ting growth and a few other things the cross street planning proposal in tamil and the north Silverdale planning proposal were accepted which is fantastic because the bago River Gorge will get a portion that is actually a buffer that's going to be provided for public access which is really exciting with walking tracks and North Silverdale will be getting the shops finally which is really fantastic and I'm super excited about that the other issues where tamil Town Center West filmy and ironbark road which council did not support have a look at the website for some of the reasoning around that the other issue was the Greater MacArthur 2040 plan which has a population anticipated of 54,000 for open area that's on top of major concern for council because the infrastructure is just not in the plan and we are calling on the state government to put infrastructure in before housing it's a no-brainer and we just want them to go back to the drawing board and deliver what is the basic requirement for our community notice emotions a couple of really great ones protecting the village of Minh angle from truck movements during development a community pantry trial to run in Warragamba which is really exciting I'm excited about that one local tourism information boards and as you know there's never too many signs in the wall and Dilli as Council of Banasik would always say and the interesting thing is we actually really going to support the water park and look at possible ways of how we could fund that so the great thing is the conversation is started and check back with us because we'll continue that how that could possibly proceed and the we're really calling on the state government to get back to us with the results from the 21 million dollars that they all it was a jam-packed night a lot of great stuff so check out the website so that you can get up to speed with what's been happening at Council thank you and until next time Cheers bye
Hi everyone this is our monthly update from the council meeting last night we talked about various things including the use of recycled water and talking to Sydney water about perhaps being able to use that on some of our playing fields and also for some of our farms we looked at their section 94 contributions and we discuss some of the projects including the silver dollar aid corridor investigation we are providing some financial support to the cellmates team festival and we also looked at dates for the council meetings for next year and the role of the mare during the period where we're all off during January Central Ward councils have been given a delegation and that's because in Buxton we have a plan to put a new toilet and a BBQ area there if we had to wait for the February meeting it would delay it so by having the central ward councillors do an approval during that time before the 30th of June those things should be in place there were lots of notices of emotion most of them actually related to the fact McArthur 2040 and we're writing to various ministers under the premier to put our objections in we're also going to alert some of our residents because we're sure that not all of them know what's going on we're going to write to the RMS and advocate for pedestrian crossing and some flashing lights at Buxton school and after a meeting I had at Durham green we're also going to look at putting some tree planting as you approach the township of an angle so we'll be writing to ministers and the premier also without concern that Wilton is not being delivered in the fashion we wanted and therefore we'll be removing our approval of that at this point in time as some of you already know that I actually handed over my resignation as mayor to the CEO and that will come into force on the 17th of December I'll still be remaining as council law I wouldn't send anybody to a by-election and I love being on this council more than you can believe this council is an amazing you to have a look at our livestream videos and we're all working to preserve our community and the values we all benefit from
All right thank you for coming why we go again we obviously have some key messages that we want to deliver to you and to our community the Wilton Newtown has the potential to deliver positive outcomes for our Shire and our future communities if well planned it is a unique opportunity to plan a great new community are we increasingly concerned that there needs to be a more coordinated approach at all levels of government all relevant government agencies and all developments or bodies if they're sudden that care our worry is that we will get any will to Newtown that is not right and our future generations will have to deal with the consequences of poor infrastructure and public transport limited employment lack of public education and access to local health services we do know people actually taking time getting here this morning because one little crisis means that the whole system comes to a halt why are we here and why are we advocating obviously we have a proposal of a huge new town a new town that has not yet finalized critical infrastructure for a to be clear we need to have a clear staging for public transport health and education infrastructure this approach runs the risk of leaving a legacy of social disadvantage and limited future prosperity we only need to have a look today at today's paper interestingly enough we've got the projects it's happening and if I want to quote some people out event they talked about the fact that a lack of jobs close to home and poor transport links means people in these areas can spend an average of three hours commuting or an equivalent of 20 working weeks each year now that's talking about areas that are closer to their jobs than what we're even proposed but how can we rock people of 20 working weeks every year which means is around to a we're going to promote a different slide in we're going to tell a story today and the stories about the D'Souza family this was not just a snapshot of our story about Wilton this is about this family so it's not about counsel this is one want to advocate for our community to the Future we talked about two scenarios for this family one in a not-so-great town and one in an absolutely fantastic great new town in a not-so-great town we've got flavor term right here over there they have long commutes that has experience where they experience higher living expenses since moving to Wilton and they feel socially isolated Jessica their daughter in the middle is David's daughter from a previous marriage and she lives unique due to the fact that transport is just so poor to get there and she was trouble finding a job and she feels directionless jack who's in the background there he can't go to school because there's no safety link over pictured road he's very bright he's keen to go to a selected high school but that would mean traveling over an hour each way for him laundry attends daycare this is Audrey on the end the really cute one and she tends daycare two days a week and she's on the waiting list for other days she's on can't get that unless she says thank you so his family and they leave his family with grandparents that we've at Carmel they try and help the parents who can't get to soccer training or can't get the children to appointments to get to from Tomball to will Newtown for these elderly people is also an issue but you know what in a great new town David works from home in the end hopefully or uses a local business hub Marie finds a close job to home and they save money on travel costs and they can work from home and they have a whole lot of activities that are close social activities just because there she enjoys going to uni because she's got to express but you're welcome down to what was on or maybe even a train she's got a part-time job at the town centre and her friends could all come around and go out to cafe in turbine evening Jack could ride his bike to school due to the pedestrian bridge on picture Road and he takes himself off know what even dad's at home and that can go to footie training and watch it he's not stuck on a road somewhere Jack's attending the orientation at the high school at Wilton and hopefully he'll make his choice of what high school he goes to soon audrey has daycare available five days a week and chance a special needs teacher assisting her with her integration she'll be able to attend the mainstream primary school next year due to the early intervention program the grandparents from Tomball they're able to catch public transport there and you know what theory they're thinking maybe they need to downsize and because there's such great health services at Wilton maybe they think something a little closer to the rest of their family into a smaller 2 and be able to access how services and help out with the children so this is in France between great town and a not so great town we want to talk about some other points obviously so clearly for growth on the fringe of the city must overcome several significant infrastructure delivery will new town will compound problems at Western Sydney communities already faced in fact because of separation in distance from Sydney's metropolitan area problems such as high private pendency poor health lower education high employment and social exclusion are hydrants we only have to look today we've just had some bad weather we've had a couple of accidents around and people are now running over an hour late for their acquaintance we want to talk about is this a solution affordable housing we've seen government at the moment both state and federal talk about the lack of housing and the need for affordable housing it is a significant issue for the people of Western Sydney however the response to this issue at this point appears to be solely focused on creasing increasing housing supply irrespective of whether these insufficient infrastructure to support the new housing the common response is that development has to be at no additional cost to government but that's a false economy as lack of investment in schools hospital and public transport infrastructure only creates poorly connected socially disadvantaged and government through a welfare dependency and the public health system why and what are we advocating for we believe that any release of land for rezoning and Wilson needs the state government to resolve many of the outstanding we need integrated healthcare facilities providing services from health clinics will be incentives and specialist centers which will give outta town a new town the size of Port Macquarie and we can't_''_483.48 be expected to rely on the health and medical services and distance townships such as cannon town which is approximately thirty kilometers away as Liverpool which is over 50 we need a provision of rail transport services we not only need electrification of our own but we need another jean-martin rail corridor to build a town with an eventual population of 50,000 plus on the rural fringe of Sydney and expect people to commute over 1 hour to work and at sometimes up to 3 hours to work and school is unacceptable we are asking the state government to claims a timely delivery of electrified passenger rail transport true depiction and a new train station at wealthy new town City the 30-minute City we were talking about this the other night is it's a some Italian context where people can access employment services and recreational services within 30 minutes of where they live and people who do not have that ability they think classifies it as a social deficit so the other thing that we need is another public primary and health high school currently we have local children traveling approximately to 17 different high schools outside our Shire everybody has to realize that's unacceptable and it disadvantages for learning and development of our young people it is a concern that the state government is expecting to double our population over the next 30 years without providing a clear commitment regards to investing in the education of a young people we need the New South Wales government to commit to finally deliver delivery of a k12 public school in Wilton as the only public high school in Wallander Lee is already over capacity I just know we had a paper that came out with this Sydney project and if I can quote Minister Rob Stokes he said good health and they can move around the community on good roads and rail well then you're doing your bit as government so I'd like to hold them to that I also note that there's a quote from the premium and it since we can't stop growing whether we like it or not but I think the biggest challenge for me as a state leader is how you do deal with that growth and bring the community along with you so that the community embraces then rather spews it it is my job to say to everybody and this is her quote yes we're growing of every government we're doing it responsibly we're doing it with all the infrastructure we need unlike the past where things just grew without schools and hospitals so that's telling you exactly what we need in this new town we need an access to a range of local jobs as part of the land use and infrastructure strategy to state that one that needs to identify an appropriate employment target to ensure that land is only released is at this moment approximately two-thirds of all the newly employed remnant travel outside the LGA to work and this is unsustainable and that's now that's not when it whole extra City happening on our border it has direct impact on the physical and emotional well-being of our residents and their ability to contribute to our local community we can't have the dads like mr. D'Souza going and healthy he can't_''_720.37 be the coach of the local football team or cricket team mum can't go to the canteen because they're all traveling so far to work housing choices needs it needs to ensure that as a vulnerable option for all people at all various stages of their lives from the first homebuyers treated as seniors and retirees like I said grandparents they need to have some option as well and needs need to be connected by cycleways pedestrian linkages to local shops and recreational facilities well we should have another slide up here now and this is called everybody working together and this is the most important state we've seen times where fragmented approach to the development of Wilton and the lack of coordination and that's what is the great concern at the moment to the council so we are advocating for a coordinated approach at all levels of government to align infrastructure investment we have early delivery they have done this before and I've seen there's an articles out there where they've actually led by example so certainly we've had a rail line going to lesson two and we've had rail lines go else where before there's been a huge number of houses there interesting enough two days ago as you can see I managed to meet with the premium I talked to her about the sacks that we're being asked as a council to take on the risk of allowing just a portion of his development to go ahead without infrastructure she said to me you shouldn't have to take that risk I then talk to her about the fact that we need this infrastructure to deliver this fantastic town she agreed with me she took the advocacy paper that we photograph taken with it so the premium understands what we're saying she said what a great document so they'll say the federal government working on the Western Sydney city deals at the moment and our council along with seven other councils and the state and federal governments are working on the Western Sydney city deals Minister Amos Taylor has identified the need for the city deal to an unlock potentially a hundred and eighty thousand baht for residential developments across those eight different council areas will turn Newtown will potentially assist in achieving this goal but it needs to be supported by the appropriate infrastructure investment to unlock that growth we have the opportunity to have an exemplar I think our general medical manager corner to edit and absolutely exemplify of a town it can be magnificent it can be a millennium an example for everybody else we've been it looked at other towns that have been developed we want our new town to be the town people are coming to look at to see what can be done delivers to make sure Wilton Newtown is a the minister federal and state members as well as the Department of Planning and Environment and key developers to meet with us and listen to our vision for a well-planned community so that we can all work together to create a great council we'll turn it can be amazing Wilson has the potential to deliver a positive outcome for all of our Shire our Shire that at this moment already has its own issues but we are willing to accept some of those because we are rural but we're not willing to fit more populations and another town without the increase that infrastructure we want it to be great for our future communities and we want to make sure this happens so our message and I had a council Banasik within and have counts for briefs with me I'll make each to everyone out there is that we're going to have a great new town or no challenge all thank you very much what's the biggest holdup I guess but like why did you decide simple this meeting and like what's positive it was obviously it's an interesting position there it's actually a very pivotal position if you think about it it's halfway between Sydney and Canberra and it's obviously the leap down to the Illawarra so we do appreciate that position is a very efficient position and originally when this was working being worked true we had everybody working together and it's got a long term process but now all of a sudden we seem to have people you know there were issues where people was doing their own thing that seemed to get solved a little bit but council feels that it's under pressure to accept some of those portions before we actually get the infrastructure promise and the worry is if we actually accept some of those houses and that's not the critical number to deliver infrastructure in the long run we don't want to run the risk of having eight a another three thousand of people out there still without infrastructure we know we've got to have a critical number to get what we need by just delivering another three and and no ensuring that we're going to get the infrastructure we're just not going to do that it's just not the right thing for us we want the infrastructure we want it to be a great town we don't want either a smaller town with no infrastructure we want a whole package we want it to be brilliant so how closely is under the proponent on board with this obviously they worked where you learn how they are so you just relying on the state government to provide the infrastructure nor do they have to provide infrastructure across so as a moment is a report called the Lewis report that we're waiting on which will talk about land use and I think that will give us some information about where we're going that is on somebody's desk at the moment apparently it's getting very close to being released but there is also the pressure to release a portion before that that before that land use study comes becomes available and really what we'd like to see is it just told us a done and let's release the entirety with the promises of the critical numbers of the critical staging of when all that infrastructure is going to happen I think that should be appropriate thing to do and the premier said we shouldn't have to take a risk and we shouldn't help them thereafter housing at the moment we can help them but we're going to have great housing not just not just a bad town we're going to have a breakdown something with an idea we've talked about a workshop we've seen a mistake something happened that candidate Carol tell that's not nothing those councils but we just start one another Narellan Rose in will and do it if they don't want this development they've got it not just provided the co-drivers at a rate summit on Monday and this issue came up seven other counselors with the can't_''_1178.9 say I will provide the corridor I can provide that corridor with Narellan road looks look what's happening every day we don't want that to happen to our log on Orcas only that there the infrastructure needs we don't now not tomorrow so I can scrutinize support me totally there's no divisional Council on this week we we wanted s to back up what the mayor says that I think it's probably been too kind the developers have got to work together and there will be our problem is we which sadly send the past promises of golf courses and other things that have not been delivered and then the five-minute speed now we have taught of 20 story buildings we the developers are going to be upfront work together otherwise if everybody thought working together that's the best service means no tell at all council briefs do you want to say something and I think you made a man really I want to reiterate councilor Banasik achieve and that is the councillors united and I aim to end up with an inspirational build in words a new town that has a past rational destination for all families that went down there this is a once in a generation opportunity to get it right have a good team of very very capable people around us the executive council and all that support them so this is an option on us now and it's incumbent on us to get it right so another question I'm sorry I'm sorry if you don't get this before what other commitments that you are clipping for all you majority support I think it's getting to that point actually I don't think we'll get there I think we'll be able to see the opportunities I'm sure with Department of Planning and the developers and the government I think if we all use a bit of common sense I think we can get something that will suit all of us you know really if we get a great town and we get this infrastructure we'll get some housing for state and federal governments that'll help the Department of Planning we'll get some great areas that the developers will be able to sell and you know develop and go out there with great great facilities it will be brilliant and the future and I think what councilor briefs just said that's another important thing you need to know that that advocacy paper was voted on unanimously and that every single councillor is on the same page Madame meeting the other evening with the Department of Planning everybody is saying the same thing a great new town or no town at all what do you think will be the next step after this meeting I expect that we'll be actually having some meetings I did speak to the premier the other day I do know that the Department of Planning will continue to work with our staff and our genomic developers will continue to work with our staff it's been a consistent message that's have been saying it for quite a while I think that we're not sure that we were being heard exactly and that's why this advocacy as out there it's just another story to make sure everybody realizes a united council they're saying that one message great into Al Gore no doubt at all I think it's probably gone why when I had the opportunity to speak to the program is was the the main issues that I'd spoke about with Italy open for anybody to give us a call at any point in time when we'll keep advocating you've got a copy of Gaza to see paper as you see our premium is holding it up there proudly for you all to see and you don't need to read at all it's not it's not a policy paper it's just a really good story about how we can have an amazing town out there and as I said surely will be things we will develop policy papers will probably you know put a lot more work into what we prevented ministers but certainly we're on we're not on the warpath we're on an advocacy to go out there were together to deliver this great new town thank you
In april 2013 one anjali shire council hosted a community forum on coal seam gas in walland dilly the forum objectives were to provide a venue for the exchange of information and views regarding the coal seam gas industry inform the community of past and future plans for CSG involuntary Shire and to provide an opportunity for council to engage with the community on the CSG industry involuntary Shire the community hall was packed to capacity to hear local dignitaries council guest speakers and residents shared their experience and concerns look I'm here to side with you here tonight and say I agree more can be done and more must be done in this area is a fact it's not an opinion this is these are bores down at Tom or where his longwall mining not chg but depressurization and I could take you to any one of ten people down there and I'll just take you to one he's Eric from Cyprus his his little balls just this little tiddly thing in his backyard it produced three liters a second and it's sustained Eric is sold to the city market one day it just disappeared and Eric from Cyprus has no water coming out of that board in wall when the longwall mining passed through underneath him so it's a reality that you can and you don't have to but you can impact on groundwater systems so whilst I may have reservations about using the chemistry to separate the upper and the lower aquifers I can only conclude from the analysis of this particular geological environment that if I were to pick an environment in New South Wales from which to extract CSG I pick this one at this point in time we're not doing any activity we'll wait to see what the new rules are and what we have to be able to do and then d determine where it is we can expand now the the coal itself and the permeability ability for gas has to be the right Cole we just can't go anywhere because we've got an expiration title and drilling spec the gas get gas out of the ground so that that's these water systems are going to mix what the volumes are particularly important though and we use that as one of our primary measures in the Camden field simply because we know as a will gets into its mature phase that the more the volumes drop off and if they don't drill after virtually nothing we know that there is more water there's a more permeable film formation nearby so tracking more the volumes is particularly important and I'll talk a little bit about isotopes just a goof is effectively what is left when the call is removed from a coal seam now it may be long or mining where this roof collapse and so forth or it may be old methods or different methods where tunnels and roadways are still largely in place doesn't matter the gas will seep into the voids or the cracks in the relax strata and holds that gas they're almost in a tank to be readily extracted to show you the extent of mining that's over in the Illawarra their massive you can see that five kilometer mark as they move from an older section of the mind into a new section they seal them off and they become a sealed tank largely your life nothing in nature is fully sealed so they're all these compartments containing very large amounts of gas down the Illawarra over here in the burg rang the same thing there are nothing very operating mines over here now but at the moment but there are certainly some very large voids and ghosts there they are a primary target of our projects even as a layman you would have to wonder they drill down vertically through fresh water and groundwater aquifers and then horizontally to the coal seam they accept inject under extreme pressure very large quantities of water sand sometimes chemicals into the coal seam causing it to fracture in order to extract a toxic brine which includes chemicals allowing the release of the gas they then have to transport that gas and toxic waste somewhere these wells can leak both into the aquifers and into the surrounding air concrete which seals them does crack somebody once said to me there really concrete that's going to crack as in essence what they said questions from the floor were invited after each speaker as well as written questions being discussed by the panel do you support the concept of a royal commission for those of us with concerns faculty can't give us any information from Australia because the studies I've operated up and my questions on the young world's when they closed the world is down do they continue to leak so I just want to say to you we're aware that it's only because of what we are doing is making with you and the government maintained government are giving us somebody to do some research and give us some information community have to have full faith in that information so yes we've got an independent person but maybe we need something more than that maybe it does need to be a royal commission I don't know but it has to be something that our community know and believe just to take away the worries and the concerns they have we have a beautiful's absolutely precious it's precious to us and it's precious to the whole of Sydney because you as you know we have the water we have a lot of the food supplies and we have tourism opportunities so we are the guardians of that
New south wales is facing a long and challenging bushfire danger period this follows many years of severe drought and then a number of years of drought-breaking rains this has resulted in a prolific growth of fuels particularly in grassland areas these fuel levels have not been seen for some 35 years this sets the scene for large uncontrollable fires which have the potential to threaten an impact on you your family your property and your community in 2006 there was a fire probably about five or six kilometers away from us we it was a very windy day as such there was an ember strike in the valley below us and very quickly a fire spread up the slope and we were soon encountering a sort of blow torch condition sadly my neighbors next door they lost their property within a very short time of the fire reaching the ridgeline here and we were we were pushed to defend ours in respect of the ember attack that we're under already this season we have seen some significant fires in the northern part of the state more recently on was impacted by a fast-moving fire which came right up to the backs of many properties questioned afterwards the residents said they were totally unprepared a survey conducted recently has revealed 89 believe the season ahead is going to be a dangerous one and 75 have said that they have not considered a bushfire survival plan or what action they might take to protect their family when I was a little boy we had a big bushfire came through our area and from from now every summer we one of the things we do is clean out our gutters and clean out all the twigs and dead leaves so it doesn't start a flower in our gutter in our in our house our bush fire survival plan is to keep the grass short because if it gets too high it can get dried out and then start a bushfire so um we keep it short with mowers and stuff around it around the house and we've only got one entrance to our place so if there's a bushfire coming from a direction over there we have to because if um it comes and before we leave we're stuck here so we're ready to be careful many parts of the wallander shire are high-risk bushfire areas we need to know what this means the bushfire survival plan will step you through this vital information what does the daily fire danger rating mean how do I prepare act survive the bushfire survival plan will take you through these very important steps do we stay and defend or leave early the bushfire survival plan clearly gives some suggestions on what to consider when making this important choice in 2002 early 2000 january 2002 when we've lost a lot of property sheds high and pretty hard-going sense we're going to just uh last year put the new shahi shed up and that's taken 10 years so you imagine how long it takes to recover from these sort of things I ask you to take a very simple step download a bushfire survival plan from the new south wales rural fire services website or pick a copy up from your local rfs district office or alternatively from with your family and go through the bushfire survival plan and discuss your options what you will do and when you will do it our rural fire service volunteer firefighters are from all walks of life they are men and women from different cultural backgrounds ages and professions they are ready to combat the fires associated with this year's bushfire danger period and beyond but we all need to do our bit to help well we had an interesting christmas day on 2001 um we were aware that there was a bushfire because I could see it from the house since we're right up on the hill here and it was moving across the ridges from the mountain area and I kept an eye on it all day but eventually it did come across the river and up the gully and previously we had just had a normal day and I'd made lunch and kept an eye on it all through the day and thought it had gone past because the wind was blowing extremely hard and it kept going but because of the gully it came I left the house we just got down the hill as the flames were going through these native trees and the house was beginning to burn and that's all we knew at that time making a survival plan is life saving we all need to make a survival plan it's all about your survival you really need to make a survival plan in this presentation we have spoken to people in our community who have lost their homes through bushfires let's hope it never happens to us remember planning to make a plan is not a plan you

It's now my pleasure to introduce leonie bell the research that leone will present to us today was her award-winning entry for the annual ron rathbone local history competition leonie has won this competition three times now because she is an excellent researcher and writer leonie is also a member of the institute of australian tour guides and does tours at the opera house when tourists and covered allow and she's also an active member of the botany bay family history society so I think I'll hand over to leone now thank you very much for your presentation today for the invitation allison I'm just going to share some slides here with everyone and uh if you just let me know that you can see the slideshow there yes we can see that thank you perfect okay so today I'm going to tell you the story of a fascinating building it has quite a varied history and it's had a couple of different names over the last century or so so we're going to discover who built it who lived there and how as a family home then it moved on to be an industrial school for girls and finally today it's a retirement village so let's start with family home now I should mention to start with that the manager of the building tells me that emphatically the name is pronounced depito however a former resident told me it was pronounced the pito so I leave it up to you to decline there so here we are at the pedo in 1885 I'm getting something strange on my screen here alison somebody's requesting remote control of my screen yes okay the pedo was built in 1885 by frederick john gibbons he was a wealthy oyster nurturer and it's declassified this house under the heritage act of 1977. of course today it's very much surrounded by suburban houses but that wasn't always the case it was once really the focal point of uh the area sitting on the top of the hill in a large estate a beloved family home and it was an obvious choice for its location at the time wollongong road was the was the eldest son of ex-convict john gibbons and freeborner and meredith and the aboriginal name of his birthplace dapto was supposedly depetto or dab-pato and you know that's where the weird name comes from it's supposed to mean water plenty in the darable language so frederick gibbons became an oyster farmer so originally the colonists had been just hand collecting oysters from the shores until they managed to out overfish the area and then the government introduced a leasing system so he got some leases in the hunter river in 1873 and but he was more than just a farmer he was an entrepreneurial businessman so he sold his own oysters but also those of others on commission uh to the various oyster saloons that featured in sydney at the time there were about 20 of them a lot of them clustered around the king street area so oysters were pretty much four man's food in this era and he had offices in sussex street so over the next few years he expanded quite a bit he took on more and more leases he eventually acquired the bellinger the name bucker camden haven so he really was monopolizing the industry he was living in kent street but he decided to build his dream home in wollongong on woolagog road in arncliff and it was originally built on a land that was given as a crown land grant to thomas hilbardwell in 1853 and then part of that land grant was sold to george pinkwool sell in 1879 and he sold a small portion of that to frederick on john gibbons in 1881. however gibbons didn't actually start developing his site until 1885. so if you're a visitor at the time you would be moving up the driveway there to the house I did ring on this lovely little ornate doorbell and then you would approach these beautiful glass panel entrance doors now of course they wouldn't have had the little ramp back then so you would then be progressing into the main hallway a cedar staircase rising up to the second story lovely plaster roses in the ceiling and of course you've got gas lighting there and linoleum floors so patent linoleum of brussels and axminster rugs so quite expensive flooring and he began to furnish this property with quite expensive and exclusive furniture a lot of it imported from london now here we have a beautiful interior the visitors might have noticed the little chippendale table there there's a walnut cabinet filled with a lot of ornaments and nice artworks hanging from the ceiling and little potted plants a very lovely uh friendly family gathering place for the piano so very nice photo there and then in the morning the family would start the day with breakfast in the breakfast room it was a big table nine foot oat table and the food would be served from the side water back there and on chilly winter mornings you'd have the log fires in the fireplace on the left there and on the top of the fireplace you can see some rather expensive parisian marble clocks and honeyton sevra and dresden bone china so you can see he had quite expensive tastes now then they would also have the formal dining room that was a massive 18-foot table and they a large family he had nine children eventually and he also liked to host a lot of social and dinner parties now heading upstairs of course uh you wouldn't have had plumbing back in those days they didn't have a water supply to the house from a windmill it was in lorraine street or now perth street but of course you would have been using a jug and a pitcher in order to wash yourself but the best room furniture was all carved from american walnut cedar and mabel maple sorry and each of the eight bedrooms was furnished with a timber or an iron bed spread a wardrobe a pedestal cupboard a dressing table and the wash stand of course now the gibbons were great gardeners they loved gardening particularly their fern house and you can imagine the family sitting on the veranda there surveying the 12 acres of lawn which was all mowed by hand remember the old iron rollers so you could take pity on their poor gardener who had some mow 12 acres for the 9 roller um if they were feeling energetic perhaps personal tennis court they might go down and pick a little bit of fruit from the orchard perhaps go from a ride from their stables or they might even climb the spiral staircase up to the roof there was a little captain's lookout you could see botany bay from the top thing now they entered a lot of gardening competitions this one was held at sales hotel in brighton and I believe this is probably catherine and her daughter emma who would have been 20 years old at that point they have a lovely display of waratahs and nice palms you can see there from their palm house and it was all backed with a lush velvet red curtain however it was actually her vegetables that won the prize for this particular flower show they love to entertain and frederick gibbons celebrated his 50th birthday and style in 1891 he had 60 guests and a dance and a dinner very nice and of course each of his daughters celebrated their wedding at the house frederick's daughter amy married accountant william tom from glasgow and then we also had in newsday 1907 to a local man called david george stead now frederick probably met his son-in-law through business ceilings because ted was on the um manager of the state trawlers undertaking and gibbons was on the oyster uh representative for the fisheries board and you might not know of stead particularly but he did have a young daughter christina from a previous marriage and she would become a famous novelist in the 30s and 40s christina said and frederick actually owned little hall and he gave uh little hall as a home for the couple the hall itself was built in 1860 by a wealthy butcher and land owner joseph davies it was a 22 acre block in bexley and davies widows sold it to gibbons in 1899 and he leased it to various tenants before giving it to his daughter after his death it was sold in 1917 at 2 85 pounds and then purchased later in the 1970 by rocktile council I'm sure some of you would have been there to visit it's now a museum so as the new century dawned all the bigger for families wanting to escape the you know the dust and the dirt and the hustle and bustle of sydney and of course we've got nearby belmont house on wollongong road to the west of de pedo and that was subdivided and sold in 1995 and fairview was started state was sold two years later frederick and catherine celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in may 1914 but three years later he was admitted to the jenner hospital in potts point and he died there in february 1917 he was aged 75 and his wife catherine survived him passing away in january 1929. he had a very long and complicated will basically frederick wanted his business empire of the oysters to remain intact as a legacy so that he would be able to support his family his wife and family for the rest of their days and he specifically says in his world that he wants his money to remain invested in the oyster industry after his death and the proceeds the prophets would go towards the family so his executives were his son-in-law william tom and his daughter emma estate as they saw fit so to pedo itself and most of the furniture and surrounding property was to be sold and the money held in trust and from this trust fund the will stated that catherine should be bought a house and receive an income and she could take as much of the furniture as she wanted you think about it an eight eight bedroom two-story house on a tall acre really a bit too much for one person because the family my men were all growing up so the first sale of 54 allotments were auctioned in 1917 and this included the house and a subdivision of plots you can see they're fronting wollongong road and also the ones at the back there fronting parliament terrorists now his total assets were 26 000 pounds 624 so a lot of money and the estate was valued the pedo itself was valued for death duties at 6 700 pounds although total sales from the first auction actually amounted to 5325. now the family now had a large amount of money to pay death duties which would have been substantial army for thousand two hundred pound just under two acres and this was quite a small portion of the original twelve acre gibbons estate which had formed an even smaller part of bargail 61 acre land grant later on the army also brought us another plot of land next door so frederick's will gave williams home the specific right to subdivide the land into housing plots if he chose to and to create any necessary roads that he would need so they extended fairview street and then the second auction was handled of the remaining plots and this was handled in family with the son-in-law when young top handling the actual sale and his brother solicitor john stewart tom handling the legalities if you go into fairview street today you'll see a lot of california bungalow style houses and just behind macquarie lodge so its next stage was a girl's home when the salvation army purchased it their intention was to open an industrial girls school and at that time the army across the eastern division was caring for 1300 boys and girls in 11 homes so before de pedo came to market presumably in rented property possibly in burwood while another army source did indicate that it may have even commenced as early as 1912 but I haven't been able to find any further evidence to this I just the one brief preference so if you look at the official records on the government website find and connect which is aimed at children who were fostered or put in homes they say that the original name of the unclip home was not changed to the nest children's home until nineteen thirty but it is shown on the second the petos estate map as that the list right from the early days and newspaper reports to corroborate this so why was it called the nest well there were lots of salvation army homes for children across the world that were named to the nest internationally and you know I think it's a reflection of the army's attitude to looking after children they wanted it to be a home a place of um respite and you know a care for the children which could children as almost criminals in a way so they wanted to protect the children in their homes originally there was intended to be an age restriction for admission of 10 to 14 years but you know a lot of the girls had sisters and as you can see from this uh where they're lined up in order of height they had kids as young as three years old there so by 1934 there were over a thousand girls passed through the doors and the reasons for them going into the industrial school could be quite varied some were orphans others had were deserted women or widows of either sex actually who just simply couldn't care for their children anymore you've got to remember that if you were out of work there was no money there was no dole in this period so financial stress could be a big issue and there could also be things like mental illness alcoholism and physical or sexual abuse in the home there could have been a lot of reasons and also we had children who were made wards of the state the courts so when this photo was published in 1921 the nest was catering for 60 girls uh one of seven eastern division homes for the salvation army who were then housing a total of 400 children the nest admitted 162 girls that year and passed on another 175 to friends or situations now you can see that we had a little school there to the left of the pillar just uh to the top of the house there and also the dining room which was now the wallace is on the side here and there's a playroom just behind the marquee so industrial schools were based on the let's see if it'll change slides there we go industrial schools were based on the british model and the industrial schools act for the relief of destitute children was introduced into australia in 1886 providing for the creation of industrial schools to which children under the age of 16 who were deemed at risk could be sent by orders of two justices of the peace until their 18th birthday now the school superintendent was responsible for feeding them religious instruction he had a lot of power or she had a lot of power they could make any rules that they thought necessary and they would have been considered quite harsh in many of the homes by today's standards now it was intended as a place of tuition for neglected children but um it was not intended as a reformatory but quite often the the line between the two became rather blurred find and connect suggests it was expressly set up to care for and educate young girls who've fallen afoul of the law well if you had three-year-olds there clearly they hadn't really fallen off the law they weren't criminals um if I can paraphrase the industrial schools act it basically applies to children whose parents were unemployed kids today we would call them homeless street kids they were surviving as best they could by scrounging or by stealing they could take your kids away if they were the children of thieves or the children of prostitutes or they were wandering around the streets so it was pretty broad as to why you could like there at the nest well an early visitor in 1918 was pretty impressed and he said had I not been told what this institution was I would have thought it was a school for very high class young girls the army appointed officers to administer and staff the institution and they were wearing these little labels for his sake um it's just reminding them of their religious duty towards the children and the first matron was commandant horsley and she was assisted by adjutants water farms and lieutenants housed in hopper and blackboard now in all salvation army homes the commanding officers would change regularly and in fact also in the in the core the churches and they would move from post to post matron maryfield was in charge in the mid-20s she was described as a true mother and homemaker with a delightful sense of fun of humor common sense sympathy and understanding and the children did regard her as a second mother and there's a great little story about merrifield had to inform two young girls that their father had died so she brings them them that their father's died and afterwards she gives them a piece of fruit then she sends them out to play so the kids go outside and go hey my dad's gone to heaven and mum just gave us this piece of fruit so next thing you know little kid comes back into the office another little kid says hey mum my father died tonight so wanting a piece of fruit as well so um I don't know how well the mystery was conveyed there in the 1950s they wore house uniforms a straw boat a hat whenever they attended church at rockdale core but at other times unless they were kind to wear a school uniform they just wore ordinary clothes now you might think perhaps wearing uniforms is a little bit over regimented but of course it creates a sense of identity and also it's very egalitarian because these kids a lot of them have been extremely poor and they might not have had great clothing so it just sort of evened out the status between the kids now they were accommodated in 17 in the morning and then they went down to the washroom they'd have a little um peg on the wall with their name on it a little bag with the brush and their comb and they're washing things then they would go and take a bath in the big iron bathtubs and then they would uh have to go to breakfast at 7 30 and they had big long tables in the dining room they had three meals a day they were provided by the staff they were going to be iron range after breakfast communal morning prayers now remember that the nesties were considered part of a family and as a part of a family you were expected to do your duty and your rostered jobs and so they were inculcated with this strong personal ethic so-called protestant ethic and they wouldn't have to make their beds each morning they would have to do chores like helping make the sandwiches for everybody's school lunch perhaps doing the washing up the dishes and of course polishing the tiles rubbing the tiles down on the porch the good job now they were also taught things like sewing the nests had a very pragmatic practical attitude to it I quote an army publication it was to be a structure for which the young are trained for the largest sphere which will claim them at an earlier date now remember that the largest sphere in that period would have been wives and mothers and these kids wouldn't have had necessarily mothers that could show them how to do things like housework and sewing and cooking they would also be working if they were of a working class and pretty much all the jobs available to women in the days for domestic duties so although you know seems a bit tough these days don't judge it too harshly they were actually preparing them the things in life that were considered pretty important at the time one of the legal requirements was they had to send them to school so they actually built a two-story uh two-room prefab building in the corner of the property called the wilson's road school and they would all go down there every athenstein public school but eventually the education department actually expanded apple spain and all the girls and all the other students went back to apple spain and the wilson's road school was closed it wasn't_''_1341.76 all work and no play they would get story time there'd be birthday celebrations saturday afternoons the mothers would come and visit them on the lawn uh they also did a lot of outdoor recreation they were very fortunate actually because the highlight of the year was the annual camp um at coleroi now the colorado youth camp is still there a bit different today but they would get two weeks holiday along with the boys from the bexley boys home nearby and that's pretty unique I would have thought amongst industrial schools these camps carried on right through from 1917 to the 1960s and they would also be doing physical culture you can see here euronga the major and mere field also was make sure that you run for one time so probably would have been quite similar things so the kids would be then playing outdoors after school and'd be after dinner prayers and then they'd go to bed between seven and eight eight o'clock depending on the age of the child now christmas was always a great time of celebration the staff would really try to make it a great family occasion and santa would come in and yes he would literally drop in from above one year one year they hit him on the roof and he had this great big bunch of balloons he had supposedly flown in from the north pole with the balloons and of course actually what he's done was climbed up this little tiny little staircase up to the uh captain's nest it was financed mayor through donations and fundraising such as the annual fate now that has continued right up till today of course it's been a bit deferred by covert but sometimes a generous donor would give them money so they could take them on an excursion to somewhere like taronga zoo sometimes they'd go to cars park for a swim at a picnic and then there would be other donations you marked girls were actively involved in the salvation army but they weren't all salvationists they came from many different denominations it was compulsory to go to church on sunday at the army at rockdale but a couple of the kids actually went on to become salvation army officers quite a few held non um non-officer positions like local officer positions at the local corps as well music was very important to them and commandant horsley formed the girls into a choir and this was called the nest girls company it toured all over the place it went up to the hunter valley it went down to the illawarra region went out west they were very very popular they were basically doing christian variety shows and of course you can see here during world war one throws of patriotism they're all wearing little flags there but they were very popular shows and I rather like this little photo of the nest girls that appeared in quite a few army publications but despite the popularity of the concerts by the late 20s they were becoming less frequent and they completely petered item here and there perhaps a visit to a hospital or a corps or a special event so by the 30s no more big tours because these things require the dedication and passion of one particular person and it takes a lot of organization to send girls off on tours to rehearse them all the time and salvation army officer postings were very short they could be six or twelve months maybe two years and you can imagine that the staff would have moved on and different staff would have different priorities so it made the continuation of the two as a little bit more difficult but you can see some of the instruments they're playing there the hand bells mandolins drums and they would also do musical culture displays as part of this now most prestigious visitor ever general evangeline booth the founder's daughter founder of the salvation army was william booth of course and she came out to submit australia in 1935 very big excitement she came by trying to central there were great crowds to to greet her and then there was spontaneous him singing popped her in the car and she went down to the nest and that's where she stayed while she was on the sydney part of the tour now the uh interesting uh presentation of the kids presented it with a kangaroo a little ribbon riot tied around its neck and she was very gracious she said well I'll try and take it back with me to london I don't think that was going to be very possible okay not the only visit general to visit general kitching also visited a couple of decades later and we also had a lot of senior officers with a big connection to the house the um the commissioners would always come down sundays they would be preaching they would be visiting they'd come down as guests on christmas day and the big fates of course so they saw quite a bit of army knife however during the war people began to worry about sydney being invaded and a lot of kids were actually evacuated to country towns including the girls from the next and they were sent to canandra from ascertain whether the girls actually were sent back to sydney or whether they had a new batch of girls admitted to um topedo at that period I can't find out that sort of information quite simply because there are privacy issues with records and children's homes records are embargoed for 100 years so unless you're a family member and requesting specific information people like myself simply can't find this information out so they went to a canalndra and then later on in 1945 the home reopened again a lot of change in the 50s state governments becoming increasingly reluctant to fund children's homes there were policies emerging more in favor of things like fostering and a lot of institutions changed and closed and eventually that would affect the nest as well so mr rathbone many of you would know ron looking a bit young there so in 1964 uh 17 self-contained retirement units were built on the site and so it was cohabited by young adults and ron rathbone was at the fate that year to open it and he noted that this was the the rockdown municipal area 1968 at the fate commissioner scotland announced that they were going to move the girls temporarily and then by january of 1969 it was decided the girls would go permanently to the lodge at stanmore and then they closed the industrial school life of this particular site so it's unknown how many girls passed through the doors of the nest nine cliff as I said before admission records aren't available to me so I can't do any statistics even if I could get hold of their records it's probably wouldn't be accurate it's impossible to know how many australian children were placed in care over the last century not just in the salvation army but across the whole of the institutions nationally records were often not kept or not kept well or they were kept in different formats and believe it or not the government doesn't even know how many orphanages existed in this period so efforts by the 2004 senate community affairs reference committee to work this all out uh suggests that maybe half a million children were vague estimate of possibly 200 000 in new south wales possibly 330 000 children came under the care of the salvation army between 1950 and 1979 but they can't_''_1792.32 be more precise so time to change okay now it was starting to become a fully retirement home they wanted to make it three tiers so they already had philip house and then with the children relocated they didn't leave the lawns anymore so they started to build new buildings 26 uh 46 two-story units were built uh the following year and that was james cook place and then there was a 67 bed nursing home called macquarie lodge located behind the pedo third stage was planned for 36 units and 51 single hostile rooms in a resident built to the east of the nursing home and the architect stevenson and turner were very anxious to harmonize the new buildings with the old now I think looking at this photo it's pretty debatable although that harmony was achieved so the reason it's pale rick is because the pedo is built a pale brick that's infused with windows are supposed to reflect the bay windows in the pedo well I don't know maybe it looked better in the 60s but they're still there they have been refurbished inside in recent times so as part of this redevelopment it was necessary to demolish the rear wing of the pedo building which had housed the kitchen laundry and servants accommodation and there you can see my quarry lodge is the new name for pedo so the final stage was opened in october 1971 by sir robin cutler the governor and dedicated by commissioner hubert scott he was the territorial commander so they now said that they had 230 people's accommodation and a depedo itself was housing the communal facilities so a da was lodged with rockdale council in december 2006 and in august 2007 the salvation army announced a major initiative for the retirement home and they wanted to tear down and replace the original aging units behind the pedo not the pale ones the original red brick ones from the 60s and they were going to spend 2 million on refurbishing the pedo itself because of course and aged care regulations and planning control but the council and the heritage people were very very supportive of the idea and uh the interesting thing is that when you know when you put something on a national register it's not just about the fabric of the building it's also about its actual function over an extended period of time so therefore you can make changes to structures with heritage orders without necessarily violating them because the 2007 report from the manager of urban planning states that the heritage council uh the heritage significance of the site relates to its ability to demonstrate historic patterns of development within the surrounding areas and for its ongoing association with an ability to demonstrate the social work of the salvation army since 1917 the overall significance of depetto can be retained by achieving a careful balance between the loss of setting and the intensification of built up area on site and that the proposed development will not only retain but enhance the heritage significance of the site by allowing for the retention of the use by the salvation army a more positive endorsement there of course it wasn't plain sailing there were still lots of things to go through but here we have macquarie lodge today and it's quite an extensive property you can see lots of new buildings in built in recent years sort of in the the final development application for stage two was submitted november 2010 and macquarie lodge advertised the opening of its new aged care win in june 2012 with high care low care and dementia beds plus 49 refurbished independent living units so they'd be the ones out the back there and it was now part of the aged care class division of the salvation army's eastern territory the eastern territory united with the southern territory in 2019 so now aged care plus is an australia-wide operation they have um 20 residential aged care centers seven retirement villages a respite centre and a variety of services for home community care as you can see the building is actually in great state of control conservation it has excellent sight lines from the street unlike many of the other buildings on end of the property of course but you know nobody these days from the biggest dates um has has the full full uh guns that they used to have 100 years ago so that's pretty normal having a look inside if you've never been inside it's an absolutely beautiful structure they've got this great classic look but it's not sort of dull and dingy it's got light and airy colorings to it really lovely original furnishings and you can see here the original fireplaces you saw some of them in the early black and white photos and now they've been retained of course so a lot of the furniture was sold off but this is all beautiful furniture so they've been able to add to and modify the retirement village and offer new aged care services without compromising the heritage value and of course the use of the site as a children's home in 1917. that was a very early use of adaptation although nobody had heard that word before then so they have a clear extension of the purpose of salvation army has now been doing at this location for 105 years which is pretty extraordinary so it's a much longer year time frame than the 32 years it's been as a family home so in conclusion it's been a varied use but in all stages it has been about family life whether for a gentleman's residence and his family where they're looking after the orphaned and neglected children and then of course today looking after the elderly so do have a hard copy available if you want to read the full thing it's about 100 pages there's one in the rockdale library you can't borrow it it's in the reference salvation army museum indexing also has a copy and of course baseline have put the copies online if you would like to read it there so I had some great help from this from kirsten at the library at rockdile dawn at the museum and uh macquarie lodge manager who's very kind to let me in and take some photos so now it is question time and I'm fascinating I was so good to hear not only the uses of the house but also the lives of the children and the people that lived there so thank you for illuminating us and bringing those um uh windows and doors and floorboards to life a little bit more I don't think there are any questions in the chat so far um I'm going to ask uh kelsey if she can unmute people so that people can ask um questions directly if they'd like to yeah people I might start I might start by actually um addressing some of the questions that were put on the facebook page and then that might answer a few things that people might be thinking about okay so I was asked who would have triggered the research well it's kind of uh connected to the next question in which she asked us do I consider visual arts such as paintings promotional posters portraits and landscapes is a true source of information well actually it was a photos that got me going on this in the first place I discovered the at bayside libraries and that really got me interested of course at the time I didn't know where the research would end me uh you know that's part of the fun of researching but I do think that uh things such as the sales poster for the subdivisions are really illuminating I showed you a couple of those there and just looking at paintings and and sketches they give you an idea of what these areas would have looked like and of course we know there's a little bit of artistic license but you are comparing multiple sources of information so you have to evaluate it in one line with that now it took me about a year on and off I wasn't doing it constantly to do this I was asked how challenged what was the most challenging thing timelines are actually really challenging because you're putting information from the council minutes from the development applications from the war cry from the newspapers and trove and try to figure out what happened when in which order can be actually a little bit tricky sometimes a little bit of thinking before you make a decision maybe somebody else will come to a slightly different position if they were looking at the information as well but you never know um I was also asked did the owner plan to establish a small museum well they don't need to because you might not be aware there's a wonderful little salvation army museum in barnsbury grove at bexley north and it's open monday to friday and the occasional saturday from nine till two and I had a lot of help from the museum they gave me so quite a few photos and things and I monopolized their computer there for months actually I was researching the warcraft so they have all the war cries on record but it's a really nice little museum so it's not specifically aimed at the piano but it has some great information about salvation army life and some wonderful items in that collection there um another question does the owner plan to make changes in the heritage listing I have no idea sorry are we going to make I think the salvation army although they have a really active historical society um you know some of our champions got a lot more on their minds probably floods at the moment so I don't know whether they would be interested in pursuing changes to the order or to the blue plaques um question that probably is on the minds of a few people is was there any abuse at this home now I read the report from the 2004 senate uh committee on forgotten australians and I also read the report the 2014 royal commission into sex abuse depedo was not mentioned in any of them um they did mention a couple of salvation army homes and unfortunately the nearby bexley boys home was um implicated and there were a few people went to jail over that but there was no indication at all there were newspaper reports where people were interviewed who lived there and they said that had a wonderful time and I also had the privilege of speaking with a former resident who had lived there from the age of five to 13 and she terrific time in her youth she said yes the discipline was strict but it was normal for the time you know children's behavior was quite different back then anyway so she said it was a wonderful place and she loved every minute and in fact a lot of the ex-nesties used to meet together monthly for many years I've sort of petered out as they got older but they clearly I really had a great affection for the place and the final question that was online was do I plan to challenge a commonly known but incorrect understanding of the area its development before the arrival of the railway and a few biographical details on gibbons it's commonly accepted that he was facing insolvency in his last years well I would dispute that he was facing insolvency and I would say I don't challenge it I would challenge people to look at the documentation I went out to the state records and I had a look at the probate packet in frederick's will now yes he did have quite a few debts but I would he had two business loans as you would expect he was a big empire he was making a lot of money from these oysters um he owed money to his doctors sick and most of the most of the things though apart from the two bank loans and his doctor's bills most of them the bills were really under 10 pounds so it was small fry so my point is that when you read the wheel his intention was always this estate would go on that his business for the oysters would go on and it would be used to support his family so no they didn't sell the house to pay the debts yes of course some of the money was used to pay the death duties and the debts but the reality was that was always part of the plan and that's why he specifically gave um his son-in-law the ability to subdivide the property he even told him in the will you can build roads of anything you need in order to do this so uh no I don't think he was bankrupt forget his widow you know one woman in an eight bedroom two-story house and 12 acres not really feasible the will actually specifies that they were to buy her a smaller house so he already said sell the house before he died so any more questions that I haven't covered in all of that thank you leone that that some that's great to hear some of those some questions answered um there is um one other question here more more to do with the ron rathbone um competition I don't know if you can see it there in the chat have I done anything on indigenous history um tracy's come across a middle near the creek where she lives and wondering if it would be a good topic to investigate um no I haven't done anything about indigenous history but certainly an intriguing thought you never know you never know what might happen any advice wow any advice you just got to look for the original documents you know source documents are great it's the second it's all very well reading secondary documents you need to be looking for source documents and I my advice of these firstly contact the baseline library because the local history collection both at rockdale and at mascot is really good and the librarians are fantastic help but you need to talk to them not just look up a cattle dog so because they know the collection really really well so that would be my advice and don't be afraid to go out to state records at kingswood they have some great stuff too although I don't know whether it be useful for indigenous history as such but certainly in general go out to state archives and yes tracy depending on which creek you're referring to and whereabouts the midden is um there are some some other researchers who might be able to uh point you in the right direction and um janet's already mentioned paul irish um grace carskins might be another possibility as well um but we can assist you with that if you'd like to get in touch with the bayside local history team um I can't see any little bit over time so if you do have any other questions um please feel free to to get in touch with us at bayside libraries um uh or um contact us by phone or by email I'll just mention that next month's talk will be on friday the 1st of august and it will be a presentation from emily jatiff who works at the sea museum which other people might know of as the australian national maritime museum and she'll be talking about um a history of shipping in botany bay and particularly a move towards more green and sustainable shipping so more details to come on that but keep friday the 1st of april around about 1 pm in your diaries and we'll we'll send through some information soon so thank you everybody for joining us on this wet and steamy friday hopefully the weather will have changed my next friday another month's month away and I hope you all have a good afternoon and my thanks again to leonie for an excellent presentation thank you thank you allison it's been a pleasure thanks leonie bye everybody

okay now what's next on here public forum public forum members of the public who have applied to speak at the meeting are now invited to address the meeting speakers are advised that a warning bell will sound when one minute of speaking time remains we have one speaker tonight speaking on item cs22.006 now report item and that's under number seven report cs2206 now uh I would invite mr matish is online online okay please go ahead thank you good evening everyone I wanted this opportunity just to provide my support for the officers recommendation to progress further work on getting additional awfully strong suggest that the reverie part option in our cliff be reassessed as one of the potential off-leash sites there's a big bit of a quick bit back by my wife and I have been residents in icliff for several years now and we do have an 18 month old labradoodle who brings a lot of joy to our lives and at the moment the nearest off-leash dog park is approximately 20 25 minute walk uh away from us being at the k hill uh part of wallace creek which is a fairly unpleasant walk as we have to go through the busy m5 intersection uh between bar street and west bonney road to get there and I assume this would be the case for other clinical banks here residents and I think it's a supportive context you keep in mind I think it's important to recognize that pet partnership has increased in our communities particularly uh in recent years and a report published in august last year by industry body animals medicines australia estimates that nationally 69 69 percent of households now in a pet which is clint this increase has been played by search in long run ship and I think it's widely recognized the mental health benefits that all pets not just dogs provide to individuals particularly during the covered lockdowns and my dog has certainly provided that support to me over the past 18 months and I've heard many similar stories from other dog voters so I think there is an obligation on the council to ensure that pet runners uh specifically dogs in this instance have suitable access to off-leash areas to allow us to look after our dogs mental and physical well-being so look rule are very supportive of the initiative to look at a range of additional off-leash sites however I did want the council and the responsible officers to revisit the riverine park in artcliff which was ruled out because it is currently classified as a as a sporting field but I understand the recreation areas can become block accessible with the council's determination and I've appreciated that the riverink park area is quite a largely flat area so to be very clear the area that directly alongside west bony road next to where the testing occurs and I strongly believe that this particular area would be an appropriate hopefully strong part with council's discretion and it is a park that I visit daily maybe twice a day when it signs out and I rarely see that park has been used for any organized sporting activity in fact but during the time that park is used by top owners to exercise their jobs and I also highlight that there are currently plans in place to redevelop nearby plant park area that will see the construction of four or five new sporting fields and there is already six existing sporting fields behind the barnard park driving range that is severely underutilized so look that's a total intense audit fields that will become available in that area and so with that context in mind and recognizing that the riverine park either referred to as oracle or regularly uh most frequently used as a dog exercise area and the fact that is located sufficiently away from any resident residential properties it's very good existing infrastructure including's already in place I would recommend that this option be reassessed by the by the officers and I'd also like to extend that I'm having to volunteer my own time and support as required uh by anyone to sort of progress this um further so thank you for the opportunity to share my views with you more stomachs uh thank you mr dutesh for joining us tonight councillors we've got an office's recommendation before us moved by councilman thank you any discussion counselors through you mr chair can I ask the responsible officer as to why based on the speaker's input tonight that that field is excluded that particular space is utilized and has a project that is being reviewed by council at the moment to expand its sport use I would suggest that the location that the speaker was referring to to the would be the west of that site could be utilized so firm stone park so um in speaking of riverine I'm specifically referring to the sporting area but there is an existing park space there if there was a playground we would be able to likely accommodate that request thank you councillor can I uh first of all thank the speaker as well as the staff for preparing this council has come a long way in regards to off-leash parks and I think this is a great initiative looking at every single ward um I echo those sentiments from our staff in looking at some of those locations mr chair if I could also add um as well to some of those sentiments uh that the speaker mentioned um there is a particle so and maybe if we could highlight this in future um planning there is a park for example in ward 5 which has a a pool fencing bono park bonner park um which it's on richie street san souzi and I think if we can just um this is to the staff through you mr chair um the concerns that have been in the past that if you've got a a smaller kind of dog or a puppy and I've seen this myself these dogs go through those pool fences so it's those little small ones will struggle to be contained in those areas I know we're not only looking at fenced off areas we're looking at the whole gamut of things so if I can just ask through you mr chair if we can put that in our planning going forward if we're looking at future sites and future provisions that uh the bottom of the pool fence uh maybe 500 mil high or whatever whatever has a more closed uh fencing structure so that it doesn't allow those puppies to escape spacing yeah how long we get the sentiment uh thank you council cedric any other comments councilman through you um I just want to know with the park at the riverine park what is the spacing between the fields and looking at the area that you have said could be a possibility because I know yes there is so there would be enough space there to uphold a 10 meter distance which doesn't sound like a lot but what we could look at doing as well is introducing some vegetation to kind of um clear sort of deviation between the playground and the intended use there and then the dog part on the other side of that thank you thank you councillor yeah thank you um mr chair just uh two parks that were left off that and I know we looked at this in the last term of council was bora lee park and garnet jackson and um you can just get a report back to the next community it's not urgent just uh using using the same uh criteria if those parts could please be tabled at the next committee meeting um I know they were excluded for for some reasons at the time but now there's a clear criterion we've matured our appetite if we can just have a look at whether they're eligible thank you sorry uh counselor thank you I've also got some questions through the chair I've noticed that natai place reserve is actually on this list and if the that feel that riverine park is also a possibility then uh would it um maybe be an idea to have one for fairly close to each other um because that can also be something that that really helps dog owners if there's that separation yeah yes I would suggest that the park that you've um identified is a smaller space and could potentially be used for your smaller dogs like you've suggested yet unfortunately if you need to uh oh okay um um yeah so the other question through the chair uh please is um with um I've had a few residents around gardner park uh contact me about there's been a lot of ranges and a lot of dog owners have been approached and and some people who walk their dogs in gardner park have felt um you know have felt a little bit harassed by the rangers and so now um they they have suggested what about um having an actual you know dog area a specific dog area in gardiner park um there's a a clearing sort of like a grass area above the sports field so it's quite it's probably um more than 20 meters away from and it's so people suggested what about having that area as a fenced or unfenced you know perfectly fenced probably off-leash area for dogs so just wondering if that was a possibility perhaps utilizing the same principles that we would apply for um garnet jackson and other facilities that may have nearby sporting facilities that that could be potentially included within report back um and then that way there's an assessment on all the sites so we've identified with those same principles thank you through you mr chair uh counselor um look I know this is quite a sensitive issue but I think councillor musket said it clearly a little bit earlier on we've got to be really careful when it comes to we went from minimal to one or two dog parks and now we're looking at many we need to be very careful where there is sporting teams playgrounds kids a lot of these sporting teams yes they might have one field they're playing on but they're also training on neighboring grass patches so I think we need to be really really careful if site then let's consider it but I'm totally opposed to having potential danger especially we've seen this in the past where councils can potentially be liable to some of these actions if there's a playground if there's a sporting field we've got to be really careful okay thank you mister thank you councillor um okay obviously there's been few incidents in gardner park and I concur with councillor cedric that you can't have off leash right next door to sporting facilities right next door to playground kids or whatever I've always been not anti-off-leash dog but I've always said that if we are going to consider further that we need to have a safe defense around whatever park that we decide in the future to go further off one for safety issues and safety is paramount now maybe the director of compliance we ask the same question again again there's been many attacks uh dogs on dogs I've got emails in walleye creek in car park with his off-leash dolls where they've been uncontrolled they can't look at at a place where it's a safe environment and have a safe defense and I'm all for it thank you thank you councillor look I'm mindful of the time so yeah council will not sorry yeah just a quick reply I didn't mean to say that the rangers were harassing people it was just people felt like they were being harassed I just want to thank council staff for putting this together I know the residents in ward 5 are very excited about the dog park proposed for riverside drive that's been a high demand so thank you on their behalf um I did get some feedback that some of the community wish there'd been some public consultation around this process so I don't know if that's something that we can take on board are we going to take this to public consultation is a question I just wanted to also mention a couple of other things from the residents um night high reserve I think is how you say it I've been told and I know it floods that she didn't think it was actually suitable and I know that was something that was mentioned about robertson street uh reserving cogura um but the main thing that I repeatedly got asked is if we could actually have some small more small dog parks apparently there is um a small dog park at tempe near the old jets uh club there and it's very popular and there's been a repeated pattern of people saying to me that their small dogs get attacked by larger dogs so there is a real demand for small dog parks across the whole of bayside thank you thank you councillor douglas look um that that's our discussion with the my guidance wouldn't would be does not spend too much time on big dog parks and small dog parks some small dogs are absolute terriers more attack big dogs and then we have like across a number of issues in bayside we've got a compliance and enforcement issue that that gives rise to who classifies a big dog who classifies a small dog I understand the reasons behind it the big dog gets attacked by small dogs so if I put but I what do you do so I don't want to create another compliance issue and a whole other issue we're trying to do the right thing by the community who's requesting we know there's a need and an appetite for more dog parks the council as a body now has a bigger appetite but I don't want that to lead to another issue of big small a classic example is the recent extension into joseph banks park which is absolutely fabulous and there was a lot of discussion from residents about um well let's put a fence down the middle of it and then this whole debate arises around what's big and what's more and who's going to say that so we're going to actually potentially have residents like this or each other because my dog's bigger than yours and you can't_''_1476.159 be in here and all that sort of stuff and then we'll talk about rangers visiting parks you know so just I on that consider the most appropriate place in the suitable area for the people where it's needed right enclosed etc there's a couple of enclosed there's a view probably a million dollars to put a fence and there's also a budget that has to come into this but let's just consider the most suitable places I've listed a couple tonight there's been a response that as well doesn't mean we're all going to get parks everywhere we're going to go through the due diligence find the budget and then we'll go to counsellor at an appropriate time thanks uh thank you councillor morrison now uh I put the motion all those in favor say hi again myself cleric thank you so much now we're on to reports number seven with reports uh we'll be dealing with cs22003 bayside community grants program 2021 2022 with the appropriate officer please give us just this summary of this report through you mr chair thank you this is council's annual allocation of community grants for the financial year this one-year that we normally do each year and the reason for that is because they've been so many special rounds of covert funding available to the community that we felt that the market had been a bit saturated if you like which was evidenced by the fact that we didn't receive as many applications as we normally would a small grant this is for seeding brands and small brands seeding grants aim to support innovative activities either never previously undertaken or not undertaken by us in bayside and the small grants are typically to support equipment purchases or small events and they can be for people who've applied previously as well so a total of 32 applications were received 21 of which have been assessed by an independent evaluation panel comprising a representative from the office of local government and a representative from department of community communities and justice so that 21 people have met the grant criteria and eligibility requirements so council's allocation for community grants is a hundred thousand dollars per annum as I mentioned normally split into two allocations per financial year and we dollars be recommended for funding and the uh unallocated funds potentially return to general revenue or put to other communities so that's a general summary the listing of the applicants and the assessments are contained within the report thank you so much now uh we have an office's recommendation could I have a mover and a second a moved by councillor naji ii by council morrissey any discussion counsellors uh councillor jason thank you chair um it's a a grants program is a terrific program um to be able to support the community it's um I think it's a great good news story and it would be all amazing to see this um shared on council's website so I'm not sure if um the grant recipients are posted on the council website and there's any follow-up stories in regards to their projects and the second part of my comment I guess was about whether there's any checking on their logo sign off or their acknowledgement of council because it would also be terrific to see all of these community groups that councillor any other comments counsellors because I'm asking your response I'm sorry okay through you mr chair councillor jensen we we normally have a small function where we present the recipients of the grants with a with a check that they can take away that's normally held before a council meeting so that they're acknowledged in that way there's photography we would then put our stories up on social media and we also have a project in mind to follow those grants through to their fruition and develop a video capture of the kinds of things that they've achieved with that money thank you thank you any other discussion counselors I'm sorry don't just counsel that um a couple of questions um the online events aren't part of this are they a separate agenda that we comes to council a separate uh conversation the online event sorry I'm sorry sorry the online events like the zoom in ours and stuff that we do is that a separate sorry uh we we have a council events update really oh sorry exciting finalize the report anyway uh any uh sorry cancer with the grants do you have to have an abn number to be eligible to apply for a grant I'll just ask running manager of community life to respond to that um yeah we normally require our grant recipients to be incorporated and to have an abn to be eligible to receive funding so can I just ask another question if they haven't got an abn but they are incorporated are they considered eligible yes we would consider we consider all applications that come in so whether they are from incorporated organizations unincorporated organizations individuals and some some applicants if their project is deemed worthy then we will ask that they in order to be successful they will need to find an auspice organization thank you thank you okay any other questions counselors discussion if not I'll put it all in favor and say I am the guy still on reports we've got report item number cs22005 council events update report can we please have a summary on that from the appropriate officer who's giving somebody to give a couple of say a couple of words about the report come to the left she's shy sorry thank you um as you all know the past couple of years have been very difficult for events we haven't been able to hold any so this report is coming up to you for consideration as we come out of covert and move back into our normal events program so we put together what we would normally do for the councillors to consider and determine which ones they would like to proceed with or if they would like to make other recommendations which we would take on board thank you mr thank you yeah okay um by councillor cedric second broadcast uh any discussion with councillors um can I just quickly say thank you to the staff for putting this together it's amazing that after covert we've come back strong there are some amazing events here and I want to thank the director as well as the staff involved I think bayside's doing a great job mr chair um and in particular um the things festival on the 14th and 15th of may plug that but also also I'm sure um other councillors will be interested in the ramadan street festival which has been going on in wall street for a few years now um as well as council of morris's uh trees for mom mother's day on the 7th of may so there's some really good stuff and we get a lot of press negative press bayside council for you know what we're not doing I think like councillor jensen said getting on the front foot and making this and I know our mayor dr christina curry has been really positive about getting the front foot in in regards to social media and we all have been trying to improve on that I think it's the only way really to show the bayside community that we're we're doing a a quite a positive job rather than all the negative press we're getting so well done to all and thank you thank you counselor counselor chancellor hi second councillor said jack thank you to the staff of um questions um I was wondering how we um scope for new events so if there's any opportunities in the future for the community I guess with a changing demographic to um be reflected in new events um being mindful of our budgetary budget position and secondly I know that there's um an event that the community in this area are still holding on to which is the um former botany gift slash bolt so I'm wondering if we could um potentially investigate some sort of hybrid of that I know that the local public schools successfully ran the bolt a few years ago to make up for the the gift I know also that there were long negotiations with the body that um produced the gift but is this something some sort of hybrid event that we could investigate in the future on the calendar I note that next year's calendar isn't there and that traditionally that event would occur january I believe thank you mr jason I'm happy to I'm happy to speak to that through you mr mr chair is concerned as as the manager mentioned we've really scrambled to try and pull together our events calendar not knowing what we were dealing with from one day to the next and we had covered covert planned events things that we said we could deliver during cover that we had to move away from so we put this calendar together knowing that this is a calendar that we can deliver during these times but we are very much looking forward to talking to the community about the type of events that they would like to see into the future and particularly with reference to the changing demographics of the area our cultural breakup our our age breakup just the changing and shifting of the community we want to be relevant to all members of the community in the events program so that's certainly the approach we'll take next year and as far as the botany gift bolt is concerned that hasn't happened in my time so that's how long it is since it has occurred but um I know that it was a very popular our scoping thank you for that I think it was a guess and I think uh I'll get a counselor you had a question on that either sorry thank you um just in terms of future events I understand that this program is locked off for the year but I did want to provide some feedback from what the community have been suggesting to me um we had the very successful international women's day event that the mayor hosted in ramsgate which really brought together women across bayside and we heard some amazing stories about how those women had broken through adversity and so it was suggested to me that in the lead-up to the next international women's day event we hold a series of online workshops to enable women to hear from speakers about breaking through the glass ceiling basically and how to overcome things like asking for a pay rise or those sorts of practical things that a lot of women don't get the opportunity and that that that seedage of the event was limited so but there is a hunger in the community gender pay gap um I've also been asked to advocate for a busking festival at dolls point uh the beautiful parkland there to have a daytime festival that enables different musical events to be having happening simultaneously and I've been continually asked to advocate for music at the activation of the parks like the one at uh lance studdard reserve that was going to happen this weekend and the one that was going to happen at the west botany street uh skate park because other um park activations that they have in places like the city of sydney include that they have they have a musical element and there's been musicians locally here who have uh offered their services to that and the other thing I've been asked to advocate for is more of the ramadan in particular in the use of utilizing the town hall and they've been really thrilled especially from the botany group to see it being used so I want to acknowledge those people who've made that possible and I mean we use rockdale town hall for our citizenship services of a spark back into the botany people so congratulations to that team thank you councilman any other discussion council councilor thank you um just a quick question through the chair um I saw on the um one of the events uh on the list is the botany historical trust agm and uh celebration I think there's a sit-down meal and um I was just wondering what would be the scope for having something similar on this side of the airport I know there are you know similar organizations such as the st george historical society so um yeah just wondering what what the scope would be for having having that kind of an event on this side through you mr chair certainly doable we've been working with the botany historical trust for a long time but that's not to say that we can't have similar events with the the sun george equivalent of that organisation thank you thanks councillor uh council naji yeah thank you mr chair uh look any council or any even residents that come up with an idea an event that we're more than happy to be happy to consider it I just want to remind myself and other counsellors I think we need to forget about that side and this side we're talking about bayside altogether so when we have an event it doesn't matter where it's held as long as it's beneficial for whatever whether it's culturally whether it's socially whether whatever the case may be on its merit we will consider it so I don't wanna make personally I'm not here anymore the west and the east or the other side and this side or of the former botany former rockdale we are based on now we've moved on so many years so any event councillor or anybody else and it's good to see councillor barlow at the back I couldn't see you from the pole and I'll see her knitting so well just to remind you my size is extra large thank you thank you thank you council morris thank you thank you mr chair um I certainly agree I think as councillors we represent uh approach councillors any time I don't think we necessarily need this forum the events calendar is fluid and can be organized and reorganized the plans are planned but but that can change obviously got to consider the budget and the do-ability of of these events the question I had though was in relation to the seniors christmas party that's uh invitational which is fine I get that um does that mean it makes it awkward because you just said about this side and that side but it's a base like seniors christmas party and we need we need a venue for it so is there going to be transport how are we going to get people from one side to the other um or are we going to alternate this year to year or what how is that what's the plan who don't drive and we know that thanks to the state government the transport is absolutely woeful in this area we can't get from one side to the other so so yeah in the past we have organised a bus that comes to the event that's great thank you and will that then be alternated to a different venue the following year we could if that's what the councillors wish to do that's yeah nothing is um set in stone we can we can look at different venues absolutely thank you sorry no no okay thank you well all right quick all right sure can I on what counselor naji uh mentioned look there's a lot of uh I fall into this trap as well we usually use sides um that's one and we usually and I do this myself I say the word I and I think it'd be nice for all councillors to recognize that we make a decision as a team and that we as a council have made a decision whether it be the dog park whether it be the street festival whatever it is and we use that kind of language that we have done this together that we have put this together I know council morris he was pushing the mother's day tree planting but we as a council the 7th of may will be there to represent our constituents yeah so I think it's the it's the let's let's come back to the language of we please sure and I'll be the first one to acknowledge her thank you cancer cedric uh now that discussions are over a motion moved by councillor cedric second about councillor jensen uh all in favor say aye against the cleric now we've already covered cs2206 through public forum we're on to cs22004 draft public art policy I'm not quite sure who's responsible through you mr chair um this draft public art policy was developed to give policy clarity around public art installations across the lga it replaces an earlier harmonized policy document that was developed post amalgamation so what that means is we took two previous policies and we harmonized them and developed one this is an update to that policy the policy recognises that developers are increasingly looking to install art in the public domain and we're wanting guidance from council about what will and won't be acceptable likewise there in the public realm the policy is supported by implementation guidelines articulating how it will be operationalized day-to-day so this policy was on public exhibition from the 14th of september to the 9th of january so it was very long exhibition period over the christmas period last year and it was presented to the february 22 meeting of council for adoption the policy at that meeting was referred to this first city services committee at the request of councillor janssen and so here we are for further consideration thank you thank you uh moved by councillor jackson second by casa morrissey any discussion uh councillors council jensen thank you for that summary um through the chair um I would given that we've been talking a little bit about the budget position I am mindful that the policy doesn't acknowledge loan work so I think along with acquisition of works which are donated acquired or commissioned we could consider a loan program as well which is being more resourceful so that's I noticed that one of the policy principles is about partnerships so I think a good strategic some of the costs so that would offset your commissioning or full acquisitional costs um I i also feel that under 5.1 capital funding um we need to be a bit more of a leader in terms of public art so the wording could be stronger in terms of council may decide to include public art it could be council should scope public art as part of all its own major infrastructure projects that you know that may or may not mean that the public art proceeds but I think that the language needs to be stronger to show a commitment to um public art also under that capital funding section I think it would be beneficial to potentially look at a donations program for public art as well to offset the cost so donations in terms of cash funding coming towards potential commissions um in line with any kind of icac principles there may be around local government and sponsorships and um finally I'd and probably more um slightly controversially um I i would be suggesting that the public art assessment group has um some form of counsellor subject matter group I think that councillors are very well attuned to their community and are representative of the community and considering that public art is in particular site specific I think it would be advantageous to have some counsellor representation at that level why not oh so I'd like to add that to um the recommendation if possible oh sorry I was talking to you to include counsellor representation on the public assessment group was I talking too fast about all the other things there was also in terms of the um policy itself suggesting um a loan program as well as looking at um forms of cash donations or sponsorships towards um commissions oh and the rewording of 5.1 the um second paragraph council may decide council should scope public art also the next line down in 5.1 taking out on occasion I just think it the change of that wording um is a stronger commitment um and just a question aside from the bayside arts festival itself can you give me some kind of indication through your chair what the annual program of public art any other form of public art I'm not sort of up to date on the inventory or what assets we have through you mr chair some of the other things that council has done has we've had the camera art exhibition it's a photography competition for residents to take photos of the surrounding areas I've won that a couple of times I believe sorry I have I have me um the sculptures at bayside and the bayside arts festival as well so I think um we're in a period of kind of developing now a new a new arts program I think that would be fair to say so I think these sorts of conversations are quite useful in that context okay thank you so there there hasn't been a regular mural or acquisitions or commissions program acquisitions that the public art policy um through the chair I wanted to raise another recommendation to the 5.1 capital funding item um to make it compulsory for all developments over a certain amount to be decided in the uh to be decided by a certain amount in the bayside lga to develop and implement a public art plan that gives back to the local community in the form of publicly accessible and engaging art so this is a snippet from the georgia's river council policy under modified provisions in the development control plans for the major centres of cog rehearsal and riverwood all new developments have a development cost value having a development cost value of more than 5 million dollars must develop and implement a public art plan a minimum of one percent of the total cost of the development is to be allocated to the public art budget so basically what that means is if it's a development over five million dollars then a small percentage which is one percent of that development has to go towards public art for bayside residents that's my recommendation so I are you adding that to the officer's recommendation sorry are you adding that to the recommendation yeah okay with the mover and the secondary I think we've got councillor jensen did you wanna we haven't got it up sorry um what would be required around the wording there would be that council investigate the feasibility of including these provisions in the dcp or in the council policy rather than trying to put it into policy now from the floor we need to be able to go and properly analyze what we could legally enforce there have been some issues with some councils having this in their dcps so we just want to be sure that when if we were recommending something back to council it could be implemented which makes sense and is this more of a planning planning major developers or whatever there's a certain criteria and a percentage that it's got to go to contribution so is this going to be an add-on contribution and what are but still it would have to be it has to go through the plan but wouldn't this not be in the public heart policy this is more to do with planning and would this be the planning committee I think we can with the wording that's been incorporated there that council investigate where we bring it could come back to services but we do need to fully investigate before it becomes policy okay sorry so what what's been added to the I can't actually see it is that the right wording uh gm yes yes it is okay uh the move in a second are you happy with that yep sure okay just I'm sorry a quick one sorry counselor jensen can I just ask a question um and before I do I I've also there's been a lot of positive feedback in regards to bayside's art and design and I just have this question in particular one side that comes to mind is indulge point the toilet that we uh renovated there not many years ago through your chair um we've put an art mural there and there has been a lot of positive feedback about that art that is being put on the outside of a toilet of all places and there's been um and I know our friends at george's river have always looked upon bayside envious that we have believe it or our previous ones down on the foreshore but of late have been quite positive in design number one and number two some of this artistic nature have been quite positive as well so my question is um when we have future uh developments such as parks such as toilets such as whatever it may be can we also add in there some kind of artistic flair that could be put up on these I mean no one wants to see a back of a toilet you know where people are feeding but if it's got a beautiful uh waratah or whatever it may be ghetto style I know counselor curry you like the ghetto stuff whatever it may be whatever it may be can we incorporate that in our in our design and we might go to the to a design competition and we might say okay all the they have to be local artists let's say for example um and they then enter a competition they draw it up and we put it on the back of the toilet is there potentially something that we can add of this idea council et cetera can I um so I think that council assets such as toilets are really really important council assets and can be beautified and as a writer reply I'd like to suggest that the committee recommendation looks at and investigates a mural program and scopes that mural program as well for the next financial year and beyond um thank you okay great suggestion so I could see that's been added to there so that that brings us to the closer discussion and we have a motion all in favor say hi so basically that brings us to the end of the agenda items no confidential reports so um being further items I declare the meeting closed at 7 45. sorry 7 thank you mr chairman uh thank you uh everyone I've never done you're always um is direct language in time not using the planetary or derogatory alarms it also asks councillors to observe the requirements of meeting practice and meeting etiquette including debates on an item will not only commence once raise your hands indicated permission to speak the hands as I see them please indicate whether you are speaking for or against the item you can speak for up to five minutes on a motion and a similar time for any amendment for the efficient conduct of this meeting is not necessary for you to repeat the matter to agree with and raised by any previous speaker it is sufficient for you to say that you will agree with the police I also remind you that the video recording is an official record of council and may be made available to persons upon requests in accordance with the government of information public access 2009. no other recordings are promising moving on to the agenda item one acknowledgement of country bayside council respects the traditional custodians of the land elders past and present on which this meeting takes place and knowledgeable and digital plans of the sydney-based there are no audio visual apologies any apologies to these rewards simon says no cp22.002 I am a councillor member of the wristband committee I am declaring a nonsense and when I'm here um I do not get remunerated there's a need for that there's no public forum um okay so report seven first my first slide is cp22.001 um thanks chair um this report is advising council that the state government has announced and particularly the minister a review of the approved rate peg so I part set the rate peg at 1.6 back in december with a base rate peg of 0.7 and a growth factor of 0.9 for bayside council the long-term average that council did its long-term financial planning on was 2.5 percent and the minister has announced the ability for a remended rate barrier rate peg for 2.5 that we have to put to council and process that through ipark for an independent review the report actually indicates that we're putting it to this committee for the committee's advice and also informing the committee that we'll be having a budget workshop on the 20th of april we'll be going through the budget in detail and the scenarios that council will be modeling as an outcome of this report thank you um mr is there a mover and by councillor fardel is there any any discussion councilwoman yeah um I would like to congratulate the local government sector and also this council for um for advocating on behalf of local councils because um this uh ipad determination of the uh 0.7 percent rate peg really um was uh quite difficult for councils to take so it's it's I was at the um local government conference when um you know we were advocating to the the local government minister that this really um needed to be looked at so it looks like um that this has been the you know concerns have been taken into account and it's really great that there's an opportunity to make a submission for the 2.5 that we were expecting so just want to thank council staff and um you know for making this submission to the government thank you councilwoman as any other questions discussion silence is golden there no there be no fur discussion I put the recommendation on the screen moved by councillors werner and fardel all those in favor of the motion say aye all those thank you uh moving on to the next agenda item cp22.002 review of the fees to the independent members of the audit and risk committee is there a move oh is there a um anyone speaking to that from council council officer before we start through you um thank you mr chair um I just the report just seeks a review of the fees we pay to the independent members of the risk and audit committee as you would be aware we finalized an expression of interest process and were able to attract some highly qualified and experienced members to the committee during that process there was considerable discussion around the the fees that were being paid our fees were set to fairly low back in 2017 and we gave an undertaking that we would review those taking into account the draft guidelines issued by the office of local government we've done a comparison of those guidelines which aren't formalized yet with some neighbouring councils um I expect that we're probably one of the first of the rank to review our fees and we've also looked the local planning panel to provide some sort of benchmarking and I think that would probably provide the council with with the most reliable comparison at this stage as to what the um what we should be paying those expert members and that is what's been recommended to you thank you for the summary mr sir um councillor fardel oh sorry I didn't get a mover you're moving that yes and a seconder moved by council fidel seconded by councillor curry I just wanted to say that um as you did scott we attended the meeting and we met in person the experts and these are very impressive people very experienced people have a lot of life experience a lot of experience in the financial sector um if we want to continue to attract those sort of people we need to be realistic about the fees that they should receive so I certainly support this and I'd also just like to say too that the staff were very impressive during the meeting too they were so so well informed and so engaging it was really it that the we review the fees thank you thank you counselor cedric through you mr chair I've just got a question uh thank you um mr soot for this information on this report um just a question in regards to the comparison fees for members per meeting by other councils compared to us um you said that they were due for review as well when did so what I'm trying to ascertain is we've come off with this amount do you think that um the fees for members from other councils will I'm assuming go up as well so is this still a conservative amount bearing that in mind I if you have a look at the the first point is we've only taken the comparisons from what's publicly available if counts if other councils looked at our fees all they would see is the 750 yeah I imagine that's what's happening at the moment we've had regard to the draft guidelines and it's um they have placed it in categories so um we are comparable to to that so those guidelines and based what the government has uh dictated for the local planning panel will will be within the bourbon park so you still think it's a good sorry through you mr check so you think it's a good uh a good area to be in that that fee overall in your opinion yes I do okay thank you thank you any other speakers council winner um I support this as well I've just got a question and also I think members of the public would like to know uh what kind of duties the members of the panel have like do they obviously they're not going through all the um you know council finances because they're not the actual auditors but just if you could give a general idea of the a bit more detail as to what the panel members what kinds of things they do thank you thank you and through the chair the independent members take on quite considerable responsibility in terms of the charter practically they review the reports that we provide them and they're quite extensive and the matters raise questions put forward suggestions the current panel has also indicated their willingness to look at drafts in their own time be able to provide us with their insights that they've got from other panels that we can use to uh improve our processes so they're given their level of experience not just in with local government but state and federal uh that would become invaluable and if you were there on at the last meeting some of that was already coming through the chair will take a much greater responsibility in terms of ensuring that the work plan is put into place and has a greater responsibility in ensuring there's cohesion amongst the the members and with the the staff thank you mister is there any further discussion so I just took a mouthful tell us more I'd certainly just uh in to respond to a couple of things there um council federal raise the this um this increase fees um will hopefully um attract and retain really good talent on our independent audit and risk um committee members and personally I see relatively small relatively small cost and uh all counsellors as we've talked about uh in previous meetings all councillors are welcome to attend those meetings um as an observer there is quite some of it is quite dry absolutely it is but a lot of it is very insightful and there's a lot to a lot to get through and that will influence down council it can influence council's strategic directions with our internal auditors and um business improvement team so um on that yeah I'll be supporting this motion as well so there no there being no further discussion I put the recommendations on the screen moved and seconded by councillors fidel and curry all those in favor of the motion say aye all those again say against I declare the motion carried moving on to the next item cp cp22003 before we commence I just want to highlight that there is a confidential attachment that relates to this item so if there is any discussion that is relates to that confidential item we will have to close the session if there's nothing related we go on that um he's sarah uh council offer who wishes to speak to that thank you okay thank you mr chair so the tender for sir joseph banks adventure playground is funded by their legacy grant we were successful in that funding last year there's also section 711 funding through development contributions and community environmental projects reserve which provides for increasing trade camping within the playground as well so the play space is designed primarily for ages 2 to 12._``_5291.44 it's the theme of an adventure play space in a natural setting and we've used the natural hills and the form of the plants to really accentuate the the use of that playground the landscaping primarily comprises locally indigenous species and would base the playground design around accessibility and include fitness so we're bringing to you tonight the outcomes of the tender process the tender opened on the 8th of february closed on the 8th of march and 6 submissions were received we're proposing the acceptance of the tender from glasgot landscape and civil for an amount of 2.68 million dollars and um this item uh is now open with my counselor curry I'll second that as the award counsellor is there any discussion counselor curry yeah thank you chair um this is a really exciting project that the community are extremely excited about and uh will just be a really good asset to um sir joseph banks park and I think will be a real attraction for many children and um so I think the um there was quite a bit of work done to get the grants so um and and the planning and everything which is a great outcome and it and it shows um the capacity of council to you know get those types of grants which are very competitive and then also to put forward an amazing asset that will be enjoyed for many many years to come so thank you to everyone who has put a lot of time and energy into that project thank you councillor curry you know councillor werner um I'd also like to congratulate staff and I think the design is lovely um when when I saw the the drawings and um so yeah thank you to the staff councillor cedric through you mr chair can I I've just got a quick question um obviously weather dependent what is the estimated completion time so uh construction will commence in may if endorsed at the council meeting and would be complete in december we have spoken to legacy grant about any delays and they are open to that considering any inclement weather that we're experiencing at the moment but we're on target for december and sorry again through you mr chair so if there is a delay I know whether it's quite difficult now to judge is there a um any usually with these kind of deals is there are clause that if they go over time is there some kind of penalty or compensation within the contract however they are able to claim wet weather extensions of time okay thank you there's any other speakers from the floor no um just just from my perspective um again it's it's going to be an amazing uh an amazing play space just um a couple challenges with is the parking there the uh the parking at the end of friendly street is at maximum capacity already on a business as usual sunday in summer or spring so we might want to just initially put some signage around the other car parking options available which could be the golf course car park it could be the tupu street car park it could be actually the boat ramp because there's a bridge directly across that so just an education uh signage not interpretive signage but education to say more parking available interpretive isn't okay more more more parking available there's going to be interpretive signs here um and and within that and it doesn't have to be in this motion just to consider the few future parking needs of that um of that area because it will it will start to impact residents close by and with full disclosure I'm one of those residents but it has been a concern raised by people in my in my community there was some talk uh in the in the motion uh sorry in the include additional fencing um my view on additional fencing around the pond is that it's a waste of money it's not gonna you know it's not a dog park pool type fencing it's just sort of something very country style and I think the money could be invested elsewhere um rather you know fencing is quite expensive um you know we've got a motion on board for the the pump track we've got some funding coming in hopefully for that in a year or two or three who knows but in in the interim it could be additional parking it could be a basketball court down there it could be something else for older kids as well as opposed so really before I just ask council officers if if there is additional funding that you please seek guidance from council uh councillors before and even on an informal basis just to seek to some direction and then pass you know put that through as a motion if it if it's required at the time and it can't_''_5623.199 be handled administratively um anyway had a thought to um at some point in the near future and I'm not suggesting in the next budget but we will have to turn our minds to the amenity block it is um it's yeah it's not very pleasant uh so if council could look at opportunities um for and look um it may not net it may just require a cosmetic upgrade to modernize it with a mural and so if we could just um yeah flag that um and there may be some future funding opportunities as well that will contribute to what is becoming the sir joseph banks master plan thank you there's been no further discussion I'll put the recommendations on the screen moved by councillor harry and myself all those in favor of the nation say aye earth through you um mr chair the uh the government um went through an extensive consultation period with the industry on whether or not councillors should be paid superannuation the end result was changes to the local government act which come into effect from the 1st of july this year the councillors the relevant uh superannuation contributions it it's discretionary so a council may resolve to do so or may do nothing and no payments are made importantly even if a council resolves to make the contributions individual councillors can decide not to receive the payment or reduce the amount of payment it receives so the matter is for firstly for the committee and then council the recommendation is framed in a way that you need to determine which way you want to recommend to the committee whether you make the contributions payable available or not thank you mr suit I have a mover for this item council werner second councillor fardel can I just make uh sorry to interrupt the wreck um you will need to decide whether to uh weather or not to resolve so which way you want to go okay so do you want that up do you want that up front so we'll speak to it yes the mover so council werner you've moved it you need to say you want to put make a decision to support councillor superannuation or not okay're going to avoid the it's a recommendation so we have to move change that into a motion so the recommendation will be that council supports the payment of superannuation to councillors so if you want to let's let's make that the motion hold on we'll just let them catch up okay thank you okay thank you so yeah councilwena um I think there's a lot of good reasons why uh we should have superannuation one of them is that without it it really does make council you know this kind of work because it it can be a lot of work and if if superannuation isn't paid it really discourages people who um you know or already have a lot of other work so uh by doing this work uh you know some some people are able to um how to put it but really uh it really helps people who do not have high incomes to become counsellors as well and I think that that's really a a progressive thing for council to do the other thing is that it encourages women have a lower uh superannuation uh that amount um often because of you know taking time off to look after children and and also because of the pay gap so I think paying superannuation would help to address that as well excellent thank you thank you councillor curry thank you check can I just ask what um with the 15 councillors what would that cost council um through you mr chair the um on the current rates the the payment will be approximately 58 000 uh dollars per annum council can I ask a question on behalf of councillor savanosky who's not here at the moment can this superannuation be backpaid is that rhetorical I don't think we need an answer to him because he's 30 years for the public record that starts on the 1st of july with no back payments thank you um from from from my perspective I reading through the report it's it's optional so councillors have the option if they do not wish to take a superannuation payment it's an opt-out if we if we if this is all councillors will be entitled to the superannuation payments as part of the fees that said if anyone wishes to opt out they have the option to do so uh and uh all everything is recorded in the annual reports as we know so it's uh it's really uh ultimately while we're making this uh available to councillors uh and if anyone was just opt out they can they can do so for their individual requirements or needs or conscience whatever so it's any further to anyone else wishes to speak okay would you like a ride of reply council winner um thank you so there being no further discussion I put the recommendations on the screen which uh just for the record recommends that the superannuation contribution payments be paid to councillors and the mayor's amount as per the amount council would be required to contribute under the commonwealth superannuation guarantee administration act all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against say no I declare it carried can I just add something sorry chair and um the option is also correct as as you can do with your with any face okay um there was no confidential session so uh we can there's no no further arms no we're all done I therefore declare the meeting closed at 8 22 pm thank you

that we give a minutes we stand and give a minute silence to remember scott thank you we now move to item four which is um apologies and attendance so we have received um an apology from councillor mcdougall are there um there are no other apologies everyone else is here would someone like to move and second the apology moved councillor nargly seconded councillor janssen all in favor say aye as we we mentioned we've got um councillor saronoski attending online and um we just would like to move and second that um that be accepted so move council naji seconded councillor awada all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried yes if he arrives thank you number we're now up to item number five disclosures of interest I remind councillors that you should should also notify um the general manager in advance of the meeting of any disclosures of interest just so that the minute secretary can prepare them on the screen um we have two councillors that have indicated that they will disclose an interest in on an item being discussed this evening I will ask each councillor in turn to confirm each of these conflicts and then open the floor should anyone else like to add any conflicts so councillor saranosky can I start with you please yes 10.2 10.2 and that's a non-pecuniary interest on did you um on the basis that you have relatives that own a property in rockdale and um we'll leave that we'll leave councillor serenosky um councillor musket I wish to declare a less than significant non-pecuniary interest in item 10.4 on the basis of perception as I am a member of the botany rsl sub-branch but I will remain in the chamber for consideration and voting on the matter thank you councillor musket are there any other disclosures of interest okay there are no other counselors that wish to disclose an interest this will be noted in the minutes thank you councillors we now move to item six which is the minutes of previous meetings so we'll start with the minutes of the council meeting held on the 9th of february 2022 and I'd just like to um in being my first meeting that I chaired I did pick up where in relation to 10.5 of the minutes on the 9th of february in that notice of motion I put the vote the amendment which was carried I should have then said that the amendment become the motion and put to the vote so in light of this oversight I put that the minutes be adopted subject to item 10.5 item do I have a seconder to that motion counselor souness is there any discussion all right all those in favor say aye against I declare that carried thank you councillors are there any other um so I now ask that um I've got a correction in 10.1 of that meeting of the ninth in february it's just that it was the notice of motion about asking the ministers to visit bayside and they left off the new the minister that we didn't know natalie ward the minister of metropolitan modes who was stated on radio you can go a different way if you don't want to travel on this toll and I believe rob stokes is involved in the transport part as well so I was just to add those to them to have a letter written to invite them out as well thank you council barlow we can make that an amendment to those minutes thank you very much are there any other um so can I go back to the the full minutes of oh are there any other discussion in relation to be um accepted all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right I now move to item 6.2 this was the minutes of the extraordinary meeting we held on the 23rd of february 2022. um do I have a mover and a second I moved councillor anarchy seconded counselor souness is there any discussion no discussion all those all those in favor please say aye against I declare the minutes confirmed tonight we have two mayoral minutes councillors and so some I think some um the first one is in relation to the response to the new south wales flood crisis and and just want to acknowledge that it's been a very challenging time for many people um across the state particularly and we've always recognized I think recognize when these disasters occur and try to prove provide support where we can so what we're suggesting is um the that council donates five thousand dollars on behalf of our community to give it which is a um as a financial donation to the new south wales flood appeal and that is a group that that are affected directly affected by the floods and that council supports our own local residents I know we had some flooding in in some of our areas as well that any of our residents whose property has been impacted by the recent floods that we provide additional free pickups of um water damaged items and so there's a little bit more detail there in in the merrell minute particularly that it you know we also want to acknowledge the hard work of our first responders and volunteers who give their all including risking their own lives to help others in times of emergency and we thank them for their tireless work and for providing the support needed for those whose lives have been impacted so I'm very I'm very proud of our community and and when we need to help council responds and and helps um when other areas need it so um therefore I um is there any discussion to the motion the merrell minute no discussion all right um there being no further discussion I put the motion which is on the screen all carried thank you councillors we now move to 7.2 so this is a on our landmark contract for a hundred percent renewable energy which is um really exciting as you will recall from my earlier merrill minute at the last meeting we're really doing some excellent work at council and have a really clear pathway and this is just another one of those the steps that we're taking entering into partnership with ss rock and a num and 25 other new south wales councils for the supply of 100 renewable energy to all bayside council-owned sites and operated facilities so although I acknowledge there is still more to be done to make our contribution towards reducing and offsetting our carbon emissions to provide for a sustainable environment for future generations to come by being part of this contract our council is taking a significant stride in doing our part to address the impacts of climate change so through this contract our council's working jointly hand-in-hand_''_1061.28 with our neighbouring councils to reduce our environmental footprint and we will continue to do more to set specific actions and targets offsetting our carbon missions into the future so there's a little some more information there for councillors which and um the public which is in the business paper which outlines the councils that are involved and um the targets and goals associated with that so another great example of councils working together and certainly when we work in partnership to create those economies of scale we can not only does it provide commercial benefits but also improved environmental outcomes so is there so I move that the merrell minute be adopted and that is on the screen there is there any discussion I just would like to congratulate um the staff on this fantastic initiative and I've been reading in the business papers as well that the council is looking into electric vehicles um in the future and I'm very excited about that uh prospect oh sorry um and yeah I just wanted to thank you for the hard work that you're doing yes definitely thank you councillor douglas is there any further discussion all right then I put the motion which is on the screen motion carried we now move to number eight which is items by exception so prior to the public forum I will we have the opportunity to move some items by exception and but we can discuss those so I'm suggesting um not the motions because I know we're all passionate about talking to our emotions but in relation to the reports and committee meetings um is there any that what we might do is go around the room and any um that people want to pull out and speak to we can and then we move the rest by exception so might just go around the room um council morris is there any you would like to council musket councillor fardell councillor janssen councillor naji councillor soonest okay thank you council soon as councilwoman 11.3 okay okay thank you councilmunna um councilwater councillor barlow I can come back counselor barlow while you have a look um counselor hannah I'm fighting with one arm tied behind my back here um that's no good I can't get my computer fired up and even the computer guy's anyway um I've just made a scribbly note I think it's item 11.3 in particular cpe 22.003 thank you councilman and we'll pull out all of tempo all of 11.3 thank you thank you um councillor douglas uh also 11.3 okay perfect and councillor cedric uh I just wanted to thank the staff for the feedback on um so did you want to pull an item no no I just wanted to thank the staff that's a 10.3 just one other thing 10.2 sorry thank the staff for that but not pull it no other time okay thank you council cedric councillor saranovsky I can see you again 10.10 10.1 um in relation to the angel angela nestor's aquatic center 10.10 okay thank you it was 10.1 I think and 10.3 I don't know if someone put that out no okay all right I think that was yeah okay okay so um what we might do is I'll just read out the ones the items that are going to remain and um so we have 10.1 which is the community strategic plan the update on deployment of smart cctv across bayside lga we have 10.10 which is the response to the question of management and lease of angelo anestas aquatic center we have 11.1 minutes of the traffic committee on the 16th of february 11.2 minutes of the bayside traffic committee on the 9th of march and then we have 11.3 um the minutes of the city planning and environment committee meeting and we also have the items where we have uh a public forum as well which will remain um and motions will remain 10.7 if we could 10.7 council of barlow that is the organizational structure yep excellent all right so um um can council deal with 10.2 separately not in bulk that way I want to abstain from voting sorry can I can you say that again please sorry if we could if council can deal with 10.2 by itself and have it recorded that I didn't participate in the vote 10.2 uh it'll be pulled out though so um oh we'll have to pull it out because it's public forum anyway yeah so that's we now move that the remaining items other than those called out um just now be adopted those called out as well as the motion so um just to be clear that all the notices of motion 12.1 to 12.6 remain and then the three items where we have public um speakers they will remain as well and so do I have a um mover and a second up moved counsellor fardel seconded councillor janssen all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right thank you councillors we will now move to the public forum so members of the public who have applied to speak at the meeting will now be invited to address the meeting we have three speakers tonight dealing with item 12.1 12.2 and 12.3 and for the purposes they are in relation to motions and I will as each speaker comes I will articulate which motion it refers to speakers are advised that a warning bell will sound when only one minute of speaking time remains speakers um so is everyone do we have um I can see we've got um is we have um one speaker present and two speakers online with us via teams so speakers are reminded to keep communication factual polite and professional and use appropriate language and tone do not use any defermentary or derogatory remarks and defamation laws apply to addresses in public forum so we move to um item 12.1 this is a notice of motion which refers to the recognition of significant historical sites and events and the installation of historical plaques and interpretive signs and this motion was submitted by councillor cedric so we have one person has registered to address the meeting about this and I invite miss anfield an interested citizen but also former councillor to please come and speak to the item sorry right madam mayor councillors and I'd like to acknowledge my former council colleagues council barlow and council sarawaki online and staff although I don't know any of the staff now or many of them except for meredith so my departure from here was in 1999 which was a long time ago all right I'm here tonight to discuss to talk about item 12.1 people very long time and and must be recognized we could rely on archival photos or the many books written by a late local historian council ron rathbone who passed away in 2009 but this simply is not good enough we need visual representation of places and people so that our residents can better appreciate our significant past in its geographic context I uncovered a wealth of information in my 23 years of research for my moorfield racecourse book this information would have in fact been lost forever had I not told the story my moorfield race calls facebook site and my moorfield material on my website keep the story active it's quite interesting probably not a day goes by without I have somebody across australia or overseas viewing that material and I'm highly honored that they do that but our local history is unique and very special to us but it needs to be better acknowledged and valued within bayside council and this notice of motion from cancer centrak would at least help to start this moving along we can recognize historical buildings such as little halls at wilson's cottage the list goes on we can recognize homes that significant people lived in don bradman lived in the cush family home in frederick street in rockdale when he was playing cricket fitness and george um cricket association we have many significant public buildings the uncliff post office the enclave fire station uh we have a region the original building in in unclear public school uh we have um bexy fire station and of course the former big sea champion council chambers which have undergone re-adaptive use along with barbary cottingen chandler street rockdale and of course primrose house at dolls point has certainly been restored to its wonderful grandeur and is now used as a school we also need to include engineering sites places of entertainment the list is actually quite extensive we have many residents have made valuable contributions to our local area and in in doing so across so many areas um having lived and worked with the mall family for so long they were very influential people um not only uh with racing uh they also supported the cottage hospitals in georgia cottage hospital and no doubt the um the school perhaps the most famous person to live in bexley that probably has never been recognized eastern george is a george reed he lived at number two beaconsfield street between 1893 and 1896. he was the premier of new south wales from 1894 to 1899 and the prime minister of australia from 1904 to 1905 very few people would probably know about george reed we could talk about christina steed who lived in little hall before the family moved to watson's bay she attended sundance goals in its inaugural year in 1916. she became a world famous author was the recipient in 1974 at the inaugural patrick white award and in 1970 since 1979 sorry there has been the christina steed prize for fiction if we look at people with an industrial background in 1904 george fielder school moved to our cliff and opened a factory on the corner of lobster street and host street it later became federal machinery and special specialized in the manufacturing of agricultural machinery its brand I excel was recognized over australia we could move on to a maker who went into business in hunter street sydney but bought a lived in rockdale he moved to rockdale in 1887 and settled in gordon street now farris street in arncliff and in 1908 he purchased a significant property the towers in forest road on cliff well we could move down to third ward and we can consider thomas sawwell a very astute businessman he certainly left his mark on brighton his hands the development he envisaged was a bathing enclosure a hotel and several streets of semi-detached cottages linked to the proposed rockdale railway station by the steam operated tramway and of course the seyworld terraces samuel cook was another significant person he was responsible for having scarborough park set aside in 1879 and of course ultimately he brought to be a much considerable influence on the government and of course the name cook park was granted in his honour so I guess we could add many more people in our local area to recognize as part of this project of um recognizing important people we could have nancy hillier from uh botany sir joseph carruthers peter I'm sharp a bexy resident who was a gymnast in the melbourne olympics and a very astute artist a residence in historical societies within georgia river council where they have this program operating are invited to submit nominations to council and usually what happens there is one in each ward is in fact considered and they choose an appropriate time of year in which to present this particular award I think it's probably very significant that it happens in a week that stands alone because we're very long overdue to raise the importance of important buildings our heritage and important people in our past I commend you to the notice of motion thank you thank you miss field um I think you've certainly articulated some of our important history so um thank you and I encourage everyone to look at miss field's website too which has a lot of interesting information on there too about our history as there are no more speakers on this item we'll now deal with the item there is a motion before us the other mover councillor cedric seconded councillor tsunus uh thank you madam mayor uh can I first thank the speaker mrs field our previous councillor on bayside or rockdale as well as georges george's field george's river cogra I guess the reason why this came about there was a lot of residents calling out for recognizing our history and bayside especially along ward 5. this is a real positive motion I want to thank the gm the staff the deputy mayor councillor tunis and sabrinoski as well as the residents and some of the residents that brought this to my attention some of the things they were saying were things like we need plaques to tell the story about our suburbs about our past we need to recognize our memories things like ramsgate baths the trams even the old zoo in san souzi believe it or not to recognize bayside we've got a rich history here whether it be european or aboriginal there's a so much that we have and it's quite significant and I think we need to recognize that and so what this motion is aiming to do is to make initiative and the annual event is that council to create an annual program um similar to what we've seen at georgia's river other councils there would be a competition kind of situation uh policy would be created to look at our heritage recognizing our history and culture and we would have an exterior bodies such as the botany historical trust or the stan george historical society to determine and assist council with coming up with five to ten nominees per year now we which I was trying to I speaking to councillor morrissey and uh and previous councillor um fields looking at when we would do this so there's you know things like history week um heritage month or week again it could be even on australia day um the idea of this is that would happen yearly it would be an annual event five to ten nominees similar to other councils obviously there would be a budget there as well as there is also programs by the new south wales government to assist in this overall this is going to recognize what we do here when bexley and we just don't know what's there and I know councilor morrissey has been speaking about this over the past few times these interpretive signs so I implore uh the councillors to get behind this this is a great thing that we could all be part of and it's a great initiative thank you thank you councillor cedric um councillor jansen uh thank you madam mayor um I am familiar with these types of schemes in my experience and commend this scheme when I initially read the notice of motion it didn't come across strongly that people were involved so I'd like that I would suggest additional wording to that to nominate a significant historical site person or event um within your motion once the speaker explained that I realized that that was the intent of it I have actually seen the speaker's website I looked it at when I was running for council and it is an amazing website full of history so thank you for speaking tonight so once again I support this scheme we were contacted by a ward 2 and signage on the corner of brody sparks drive and the highway out the front of walleye creek I think that is a good one to begin with that signage with in regards to tempe house is in a dilapidated condition um and it would be a good one to replace for that community there so just wanted to put that out there also for ward 2. that resident's name was ross berry and he's been championing the replacement of that signage and the maintenance of that garden for some time now it's in a prominent site so I'd like that to be considered as part of the scheme thank you thank you councillor jansen are you happy with the amendment to add people thank you and then um are you happy if we just add that as one suggestion and I taking into note that there will be suggestions from other awards problem with suggestions um I think it's great um especially my fellow councillor jensen there just long as we have a process that it's a fair process and it's done forum I'm off for it yeah all right so we can um say that councillors can put forward with community consultation some some ideas for council's consideration um councillor saranovsky did you want to say something um could you just unmute please councillor saranovsky can you hear me yes thank you oh thank you madame I just want to firstly thank manfield could I sorry councillor could you please go a little bit closer to the microphone yeah yeah yeah and layout yeah thank you madame I just wanted to um thank um former counselor ann phil for her presentation um and and will uh research thank you ann I want to commend councillor cedric for putting up this uh notice emotion mr maybe in terms of the signs can I make a suggestion whenever I go in the city I'm amazed of the historical signs that I've put up around this cbd and I actually spent quite a bit of time walking around and I find it really interesting to find out the history of the various buildings and that's why I totally support about the budget because it's important uh many mere that we can apply for the funding to the state government uh I guess we need to make these signs easily to be read and noticeable um and that's one thing that some of the residents that have contacted me over the years would like to see the history of a particular side or a park so if we could look at the signage uh to be noticeable easily read and a bit of interest in comments on it and maybe if we could just go in the city and have a look at some of the signs that have been put up around the cbd but once again I i I commend um everyone that's behind this notice emotion and thank you castle cedric and thank you former council anfield I totally support this thank you that's a good suggestion councillor saranovsky thank you are there any other speakers thank you madame I support this and I i think it's something that's a long time in coming I'd like to thank um former to thank paul for finally taking his training rules off and jumping into the into the deep end of the pool um and people around the table know what I mean but it's a great look it's a great initiative we have got a subtle version of this so you gotta let them haul you can see the signage they're fair enough it's on the street you go to tempe house you've got to go through the bushes to find it so we have tried it we haven't made an attempt down at ramsgate there's a big plaque down there telling the people what happened in the years gone by but as the years go on the people that know this information unfortunately pass away we need to collate it we need to grab it I met a gentleman two weeks ago who came from queensland who's coming down after all the covert business his father lived in ramsgate in 1970 uh in um in 1936 in 1936 king george v was the the monarch of this country passed away and there the sporting groups that there was three days of mourning and yeah I could not play cricket for that weekend or the 20th of january the nippers program all the swimming programs were cancelled so that's a little bit of information that it's it's a live piece of information that came to me he gave me an extract of the of the letter but without that being sort of transmitted no one knows about it that's our history so it's a good thing I think if we do place a monetary amount to the side to develop this it's a great thing but I think we should develop a bit further and look at doing um walking trails I think council sabronovsky would talked about the signage they have down in the city of sydney and especially around chippendale-wise areas there's there's actually interpretive markers where you see okay this is what building was here you walk down the street it directs you to go to somewhere else you could walk for hours and just follow the history of the place as something we can consider as well apart from just individual building signage there's probably an issue with putting a sign up in front of the house and say don bradman lived here it might be a problem to the resident but I'm sure we can get over that but there's a lot of other people that have lived in our area and have have made a substantial contribution to arts to to loads of loads of fields so I commend the motion and I hope I hope we get a lot of traction in the next 12 months with it yeah thank you council students and and we've got around daisy bill we've got um plaques of um different people that went to to war and fought for us and you can read their story and a lot of the streets are named after them and it is it's just a um you know a really nice thing to be able to particularly for younger people to connect to our history and I just like to support the motion I'm so glad we protect our heritage in 1995 when I was elected there was five of us out of 15. they threw out everything all our everything that was done over the years of the um the heritage list and there was the three four ward four councillors there was one former uh ron rathbone steve harder myself former council anfield and I think eve on bellamy and that was all and the rest just threw everything out so we started again so I'm really pleased about it in the blue plaques I did find out about was too late to try and get some entries in but that came from the honourable mark buchvik so I'm sure he'll notify us next time so I'm glad it's here and finally we might have something and ramsgate balls was pemberton barbs with a zoo in it and I actually swam they caught the black and white bus down to catch to swim in the pemberton valves excellent all right um sorry madame oh yes counselor can't_''_2818.8 let this pass without making a few comments and thank you to listen to that for hours very very interesting rich history in this area going back a long long while and I commend to you her book on moorfield racecourse which happens to have one of my relatives mentioned in it so there you go um but look uh congratulations to councillor sedrak for this um gee a lot's happened in six years I've been gone for six years and we seem to have had an epiphany it's really really quite incredible we're talking about history and we're we're talking about heritage so um yeah I think this is good congratulations you've come back at the right time then counselor counsellor douglas yeah I also recommend the motion um but I agree with the counselor sooners that I think council should look into taking it a step further um my concerns are with the self-nomination process that it we're losing people we're losing our elderly residents and five to ten nominations per year is probably just not enough to retain that history that's so rich across such a big area also have those elderly residents in order to put those nominations forward so we've seen that in the demographics of the community strategic plan we've reviewed so my suggestion is if we could have an amendment to this uh councillor cedric for the uh the appropriate committee to review the idea of a heritage trail in bayside quickly I don't mind that I think that's a great idea there are other councillors that are this for example on um on our beachfront having a trail it could be like even a tourist attraction where you get a map from council and it says koema this is what happened brighton this is what happened so I'm happy for the committee to instigate all this kind of stuff look in regards to the numbers um councillor field was mentioning that george's river did only have three there is a cost associated with this if the committee find that and I speaking to the gm five to ten is probably the appropriate amount however if the committee and there's there's a lot of nominations coming from they want to put more it's fine it's not a finite definition and adding that is is also it's not a problem either thank you yes counselor musket thank you madam mayor I'd also like to add in regards to the historical part of it that for educational purposes each of the stages have a historical unit and they have to look at the community so having this information and documentation would enhance that educational learning in our area so we've only got the old botany bay books there's the green and the blue and the brown reddy brown book but we have nothing else that the children can go to so I commend this motion and I'd like to see it go further for educational purposes through you madame um maybe that last one that are the appropriate committee review heritage trail and educational resources experiences for primary our local schools high school primary yep so we'll just um yeah add that that it that it then um that that motion will then have to come back to a committee anyway's no other speakers all those in favor say ai again it's an amendment or is it I'd suggest that council douglas moves if the nervous accepts it to move her amendment into the you know into the motion so we'll just make it separate we'll just add a number six that it goes to the um relevant committee so um we'll wait for that to pop up on the screen actually I probably just actually excuse me madame I'd probably just prefer that that's kept separate if that's okay if we could just vote on it separately we're just voting on the amendment just a moment thank you thank you so um the process would be that um you've asked for an amendment and the mover has accepted the amendment so therefore it becomes part of the motion okay so now that is on the screen um that we that the appropriate committee review um review the whole it it's actually um review everything that's in the motion so a report be provided in relation to this committee and that way then there's an opportunity in the committee meeting to unpack all the moving parts of um to include in this moving forward all right so therefore we can now see that um that the appropriate committee review heritage um so what we might actually do if you're okay councillor janssen we may just leave out number six because and we'll raise that at another at the committee people can put forward suggestions if that's okay with you councillor jansen yeah okay so we'll also um so yeah um so remove number six please yep excellent and that the and just leave number seven that the appropriate committee review um that a report come to the next appropriate committee meeting and then um if we can move to when when you're finished and then we'll just add people to the top so we've covered places people and events so you can remove everything after committee because that can all be discussed at committee the rest of it plaques people and interpretive signs ies sites people yeah just people excellent seven and just remove everything after committee and that becomes number six all right thank you so that will um come back to um a committee report will come back where further discussion can where those things can be contributed all right no further discussion I put the motion on the screen all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried all right we now move to um item 12.2 this is the notice of motion to reduce the number of people smoking along the bright and lasans for sure we've got one person that's registered to speak and I now invite mr chabel el hajj who is an interested resident to invite him onto teams so mr el hajj are you on teams yeah oman can you hear me yes I can hear you welcome to our meeting and thank you for speaking to this item can you please confirm whether you are speaking for or against the motion speaking for the motion okay thank you mr el hajj um if you would like to you have five minutes to speak okay so it's at age on brighton for sure good evening madam mayor members of the council and fellow community members of bayside council my name is shabel el hoge and I live in monterey with my wife and three young children we spend a lot of time at brighton beach as a family and more often as my children have grown they have complained to me about second-hand smoke when they are down there according to health new south wales there is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke we recognize that smoking cigarettes is prohibited in certain areas of new south wales under the smokers free environment act 2000 also recognizing that many local councils in new south wales have now banned smoking on their beaches entirely for everyone's understanding the majority of the second-hand smoke at our local beaches is coming from a tobacco pipe known as the shisha also different to cigarettes this must be recognized as still smoking tobacco which produces significant second-hand smoke I propose that our community ban the smoking of all tobacco-related products that produce second-hand smoke from our beaches in our community left innocent harmful substance in their lungs and tonight I speak in favor on this motion and thank councillor cedric for pushing this issue thank you thank you uh mr alhaj for addressing us tonight thank you there are no more speakers on this item so we'll now deal with the item there is a motion before us um is there a mover and a seconder moved council cedric seconded council souness I have a mover and a secondary would you like to speak to the motion thank you madam mayor can I also thank mr alhaj for his comments this is other than the some of the hooning and antisocial behavior in in brighton and rubbish this is probably the next big issue is smoking on the beach and this is not um and I want to thank also some of the other counselors involved and the gm as well as the directors councillor tunis and hannah for bringing this to my attention at our last meeting about smoking since then and prior to this people have constantly brought this to my attention that smoking is an issue be seen as this is attacking any one cultural group this is really what it's about and I'm happy to to um you know look at amending it if necessary the aim here ladies and gentlemen is that we have a smoking issue at brighton beach families find it hard to walk down the beach without seeing some kind of smoke and so um without going full steam ahead what I'm asking for here is at the moment we've got these smoke-free zone signs at brighton and I've taken a few photos of them and people have sent them to me we might need a few more um we might not need to look at other things so what we're asking here guys or counsellors is that we're asking for the committee this be taken to a committee meeting the city services committee to be unpacked to look at all the options whether it be ranges on the weekends I know that's a complicated process whether it be paid police on weekends I know there's an additional cost to that whether I would love to see the professionals our directors our staff put something together to look at how we could best attack this situation and at the moment what we've got is and I'm not talking about also smoking um I don't have a problem with smoking if someone wants to smoke indoors in a facilitated area that's fine if they want to smoke at home that's fine we we are talking about the brighton smoke-free zone only in that bright and smoke-free zone I'm not talking about anywhere else that's not my concern in this motion so it's not that I'm against smoking um it's a I'm against smoking in this smoking-free zone so this is what this motion's all about it's asking the staff to bring back to us through the committee um that they could give us some options of how we could do with this and I'm open to suggestions I'm here to say this is an issue it needs to be bought out and we need to attack it thank two subject to um at first going to a report going to committee yeah especially take off member for health I don't know what the member for health is yeah councillor said drax agreed to the removal of um number two thank you councillor cedric councillor soonis yes so last year um the previous council brought up a motion um to ban smoking from public areas pretty much along the foreshore I'd love to extend that and ban smoking where kids frequent it exists around playgrounds but only a certain distance from the playground within parks themselves again very diabolical to to um administer and and control people because we have a lot of parks there's a lot of people that smoke in the parks and the kids are playing right next to them we have this issue you're walking along the long somewhere someone's vaping in front of you you're in a plume of smoke if I want to do that I'll get on a steam train and and then chew the smoke that way so and there are people that do smoke in the smoke in their home smoke away from other people but there's a number that don't so that's what this motion's about there's a whole group of people and we've seen photos and requests and speaking a lot of people that this exists along the foreshore not just brighton exists elsewhere from one in the foreshore to the other if we need to pinpoint an area we might as well pinpoint the foreshore there was a motion prior to the last motion that we had that we designated a zone along the boardwalk at um brighton to say no to smoking and we've extended that beyond to wherever we have a smoking enclosure for those people that went here in the last term sakaima uh brighton ramsgate monterey's baths sanrohan baths all have that restriction the signage finally is starting to go up I've seen it going up which is good so whether people pay attention to that I don't know but we try we try our best we can only try it's like it's like'll rather throw it on the ground that actually put in the bin so it's an education process and it's also a possible enforcement process which this motion talks about um and I would imagine as we take it into a committee we'll be talking about other ways of managing these issues one thing that did come up in the conversation that we had around this is okay so people want to have shisha maybe we can explore if it's permissible within certain establishments under controlled uh and a controlled environment you go to the rsl there's people gambling they're smoking you can choose to go in there you choose not to go in there so it's managed and controlled so maybe that can be another point we can explore that as we go into committee and I know that we have a ban on our outdoor dining areas which directly impacts individuals people walk past people sit next to outdoor dining they don't want to be um harangued by other people's secondhand smoke but I believe we have some establishments she should be allowed or smoking be allowed within that establishment maybe we can look at that moving forward and creating a policy around that where that only the participants only the people that want to go and participate in that activity participate in that activity and it doesn't have second hand outcomes to other people so that's an opportunity for that committee um to explore I don't know if we need to write anything down on that but I'd like that to be explored and get that off the table if it is an issue that we can we can remedy for certain business people let's remedy it but in terms of outdoor dining no I i can't agree in reviewing that or looking at it differently and it's better for us to have it um outlawed in inverted commas rather than waiting for through our mechanism of our lease leasing arrangements rather than waiting for someone from the department of health to turn up and tap people on the shoulders so I commend the motion there's a there's a think has said right there myself we're not picking on the people that like this activity it's just the activities in the appropriate place okay like cahooning if you want to cartoon go to eastern creek go to wherever there's race tracks do whatever you have to do get it out of your system similar to this you want to do your smoking do it in the comfort of your own home go to the places like the rsls or whatever clubs have this opportunity go and do it but keep it far separate from the general public and even further away from kids who can't say no all right thank you thank you madam all right so um so we've got um councillor hannah and then council saronoski then council werner then councillor janssen he's doing these ones thank you madam mayor look um I feel a little bit uncomfortable about this and I've been mentioned in dispatches I feel like I've been a little bit verbal I what I would like to say is that I think the wording of uncomfortable I i think that we should be just talking about measures to try and reduce the number of people smoking I do use ramsgate beach a fair bit and I am subjected quite often to second-hand smoke from various sources so I don't I don't think we should be talking about smoking that just comes from one particular type of device I think we should be targeting trying to get better control in our non-smoking areas for all forms of smoking I don't know whether or not the whether or not the mover of this motion might be prepared to amend this to to just delete the words shisha and and in the um the actual motion to delete those words and just say smoking because that's all encompassing with cigarettes in particular there is a very very significant litter problem also and I know someone that swims regularly down at ramsgate who who regularly spends half an hour to an hour picking up cigarette butts so that's a byproduct of this as well so I'm just thinking that we we shouldn't of smoking so I don't know if the mover would would be prepared to eliminate those those references I still believe it's going to have exactly the same effect except we're going to be able to use it to perhaps try and better manage the people that ignore the no smoking zone whether they'd be smoking cigarettes roll your own you know telehove cigars shisha vaping you you name it I think we should be covering the whole gambit thank you councillor hannah just one moment no no just one moment thank you thank you thank you councillor hannah um councillor cedric councillor hannah would you be willing to accept that amendment can I say if we can maybe we can change brighton for sure to cook park for sure that captures the entire length of all the areas where we've signed we're signposting at the moment so thank you council tsunas um you have a another suggestion there what what what are your thoughts so um we make an amendment along cook park okay and we remove the word shisha okay so um in the title um thank you and so we'll leave it as general all right um so at the moment um that we've got that um those amendments that have been accepted by the mover is there any further discussion no further thank you all right sorry I did I didn't promise councillor saranovsky thank you I thought people might have um backed off but councillor saranovsky yeah can you come a bit closer councillor saranovsky sorry yeah madame I rise to support um the notice of motion and I basically counsel hannah took all most of the things that I was going to say that um in relation to this but the the walking around our city uh particularly the old rockdale the two biggest issues that confront me by residents one is the hoons two is the smoking and that's something um that is a big issue in terms of a health issue I don't smoke at all uh but by just go walking on the beach there's a lot of things that are happening in terms of uh I have no decision but the biggest issue uh madame era is after they finish their smoking they don't take their rubbish away with them they leave it we've got special bins for them particularly for the barbecues but I think we should go on the front forward um and um I'm delighted to see that it's an amendment that from kaimaa down to um capitol bridge we should be banning all forms of smoking um you know when you've got families to go on the beach or in the park the last thing you want is your kids to have been hard in second-hand um uh smoke so I i commend the um you know some motion thank you councillor saranovsky and in that report that comes to committee will certainly um for new councillors articulate in there where the bans currently exist um to councillor barlow well I was not going to support the original motion because I found it racist I found it insulting I hate smoking I'm glad that it's now changed to just smoking I had my husband die of smoking-related choked to death because she had emphysema so I do not like smoking but I did not like the way that notice emotion was written it was targeted as far as I'm concerned and I think anyone that read it could have been offended you said no it's not a cultural thing but it is smoking is smoking cigarettes whatever you want vaping whatever the new thing is the kids do and you don't smoke outside your shots because it's managed by the health department so it's a different thing and if when I had my business I should just say go away move I had a table around the corner but that regulation came in it's brilliant for the shopkeepers but they're forever fighting the smokers because they just want to smoke um so I will support the motion now that the wording has changed otherwise there was no way I was supporting the wedding as it was thank you councillor barlows I've never smoked in my life I always I am an anti-smoker and I always recommend and and use but I have to first of all thank councillor hannah and thank council avalo for their input and there is no way that I can be convinced otherwise that it was targeted because as counselor hana said smoking there's all types of smoking whether it's cigarettes whether it's cigars whether it's the shishas and whether a bong a bong or any types of smoking even cars brings out some exhaust smoking from the from the vehicles but we're not gonna go there but yes this is a different motion now but I can assure you I think it was I mean think about it councillors who goes to bryden beach and has the shisha who does and that is targeting a group targeting a culture I'm not going to get into religion because that that's a bit too far because all types of people smoke shisha from that culture whether you're muslim you're christian or whatever but just having nashesha and disregard for other smoking this is a disgrace and I'm glad council ahana picked on it first because I right now this what we have in front of us is a change we're talking about smoking now if we want to be serious about this it doesn't matter what organization in this world whether it's an airport whether it's a hospital whether it's this council facility they all dedicate a a space where people go and smoke you can't stop shisha it's culturally it's everywhere in it's in every council but every council has a a designated area and if it's a restaurant they designate an area the way so it can comply it's up to the it's their wish about smoking it's up to the individual if they want to smoke or not but yeah sure we we we are as counsellors should provide a safe non-smoking areas but just don't target the shisha a culture and that's what I've seen and thank you council ohana again thank you council naji all right so no further discussion do you want to write a reply counselor cedric thank you madam mayor look I think it's a good addition um and it's great to see councillor barlow agree on one of these motions twice in a row I think she's she's loving this moment so thank you thank you as I appreciate it I appreciate it thank you councillors thank you can I just just point out I think people are starting to look at this in a personal way and thank you and this is not supposed to be personal in any way my family and friends are part of this culture my culture and history pretty much invented shisha so when we say this is targeting a certain ethnic group that is not the intention I understand it might be because some certain ethnic groups smoke this however that is not the intention but I I'm here and I've changed this motion for the sake of the floor for the sake of the other uh even people that have caught to might come to my attention and said you know counselor it's maybe better however the issue that we have down there let's not this on its on on what it is when people call up and send me emails they send it about not cigarettes or vapes they send it about shisha and I'll say it again I'm not against shisha definitely not I've got a few myself so this is not a cultural thing and I think that what people want to do right now is turn it into cultural targeting certain ethnic groups or religions it's far from that but if I'm not I'm going to stand here and be honest with myself come down toward five any any weekend and you tell me if this is not one key issue shisha it's not a cigarette we're not talking about cigarettes but for the sake of other councillors for the sake of the residence so we could investigate this further and push it forward I'm happy to remove that word if that's what everyone's going to be sensitive about because the main aim here is to reduce it at the beach at the end of the day it will still 20 teenage boys saying put that out good luck so we need to come up with strategies to stop this we're not trying to make this a political issue or about ethnic groups I come from this ethnic group thank you thank you thank you councillor cedric all right we have an amended um motion that has the amendments have been accepted by the original mover so that is now in front of you on the screen all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried we now move um to item 12.3 which is a notice of motion climate change mitigation and adaptation plan submitted by um councillor werner so we have one person um oh um we just need to check we did have a registered speaker mr stephen bell has mr steven bell is he online or here no he doesn't appear to be online um have we tried to contact him by teams or did he say he was attending in person okay so we we know that he what he was attending in person but is currently um not at this this motion back into its normal order so we will not um consider this motion at this point in time all right councillors um that brings us to our reports our um remaining reports so the first report that remains is the com 10.1 which is the community strategic plan so the draft for public exhibition there is an officer's recommendation before us which is on the screen there that um it go on public exhibition for 28 days um is there a mover and a secondary moved councillor barlow seconded councillor souness is there um councillor barlow would you like to speak to the motion look the only reason I brought it up was the fact that audigate hit would have been hidden it is going on public exhibition I've had already had a resident write to me to change something I said no please put it in when it goes on public exhibition so that's the only reason I've brought it forward because I feel that anyone that's watching that or listens to it later realise that we've got something and it submissions yeah good point and then congratulate the staff on the document as well good point council abalo and we'll certainly continue to promote we'll promote it on social media and in our newsletter next week as well to encourage people to participate actually I was quite pleased in the process that was undertaken at first I thought it's a little bit of um I don't know mirrors and smoke and things like that but honestly watching the process develop over the past few weeks I'm I'm pleased with it it's fantastic I just hope we have the community that that that actually jumps on the back of this and actually gives us feedback um which we can modify our our our plan as we move forward it's it was a great exercise I think so well run to the staff and well done to the the management team at the top thank you council soonest all right there no further discussion um so the motion on the screen that it goes for public exhibition all those in favor say aye against move to item 10.3 no we um dealt with two we didn't deal with 10.2 oh I needed division in 10.2 so we do need to put that um forward so 10.2 this is the amendment to rockdale development control plan so I'm just noting that um there was an interest councillor councillor saronoski um has indicated an interest and council saranovsky can you please leave the teams he has councillor saranovsky can you please leave the meeting oh and come back um okay councillor saranovsky oh still there okay councillor saronoski has left the team's meeting he's not on the screen um therefore I now put um 10.2 this is the amendment to rockdale development control plan 2011. the land subject to proposed amendment 1 to bayside local environmental plan and there is an officer recommendation before us is there a mover and a secondary moved councillor jansen seconded councillor souness are there any speakers to this item so there are no speakers to this item then I put the motion on the screen all those in favor say aye I have to call a motion can you please put your hand up and I will go around the room so all those in support of the motion put your hand up counselors are you when you're ready and I'll call them out thank you all right council uh councillor morrissey councillor musket councillor fardell councillor jansen council anarchy counselor tsunas councillor werner councillor awada councillor barlow councillor hannah councillor douglas and councillor siddrack and sorry and my thank you and I'm um for emotion as well and so that therefore um we have everyone in favor everyone present at the meeting in favor of the motion and therefore I declare the motion carried we would now like to invite councillor saronoski back on screen please um councillors can I suggest everyone stand up and has a stretch while we're waiting left ear to left shoulder so for people listening at home we're just taking a moment for health benefits just to stretch and move and counselor saronoski is back so please I encourage you to take your seats again and we will recommence all right we now um we update on deployment of smart cctv across bayside lga and we have an officer recommendation before us and I have mover councillor cedric second councillor tunis councillor cedric would you like to speak thank you madam mayor I'll be very brief can I um with these cameras and cctv cctv um smart cameras I want to thank the staff for preparing this report and update in particular the gm and you madame mayer for your involvement in this process I think this report is a first step in showing some of the positive things that we're doing um there is no doubt no doubt especially in ward 5 where hooning and antisocial behavior is an issue and by no means is this solving the problem but it's a step in the right direction and this report is only targeting some of those points so I want to thank the people that were involved in that secondly a lot of the residents who came out I want to thank them who came out and met um councillor douglas myself councillor tunis uh councillor mcdougall and you mademeer at of the first questions I asked you know to get the ball rolling do you know about these cameras what's going on how do you feel quite a positive response people that live in the southern parts of ward 5 there's quite a positive response and that's where we were in ramsgate there's a quite a positive response in how this has reduced um that anti-social behavior in huni so I want to thank them for coming out all those people it's great to get their positive feedback as well as seeing this report however I know for a fact that this is only the start and I know these cameras in their whole gamut is only is only reaching its I guess not even reaching its full potential I know there's a long road to go there's still a lot of issues down there and all you've got to do is just open your eyes or go down and open your ears and you'll see especially on weekends anyone that lives in that bay street region or even down the not saying this is solving the problem and I'm not saying that in any way we're going a step in the right direction by having this as well as um through your merrell minute um at our I think original meeting or second meeting madam mayor that one about instigating that that uh action group with uh the member of rockdile steve camper I think this is all going to go hand in hand and I would love to see how far this can go I would love to see instead of the fines being let's say um you know hundreds of thousands I could see that this would go up and up and up once we were in full swing so I want to thank everybody once again and I'm I'm looking forward to how much this can grow thank you thank you councillor cedric and it's certainly I encourage residents to read the report there's some really interesting data in there and I think we're going to really start to see some some changes there also just um in relation minutes from last meeting and I have had conversations with mr steve kamper the member for rockdale so that working group will um the process for that will um be made available shortly as well so there's been some planning that's been taken place there um between council and mr camper's office so that will be good to to see that um start up counselor soonis thank you madam chair it's a great initiative a lot of people love it some people hate it the people that hate are the people who are scared to be caught on it so in the long run though the I think what's going to happen from talking around the the trap so to speak the people that do do the wrong thing or rather improve their behavior tremendously because they know there's a camera over their shoulder or they'll move away that's what happened in the past when the police started chasing the hoons up around our neck of the woods so to speak they just moved away they moved south they moved back over do the wrong things in terms of motor vehicle activity earning speeding all that sort of stuff don't want to be seen don't want to be caught obviously but they have mechanisms they have phones they have communications they move the growing problem though in our area and our cameras won't catch them hopefully through other forms of recognition in terms of identifying faces and clothing and so on to the people on these motorbikes that I noticed the other day that for whom past my house no number plates on the back those trailblocks they just go they do their thing apparently it's a it's a new trend now they knock on the window of the police car give them the bird and then take off and the police can't chase them because because they can't they've been told not to chase them because it'll create a critical incident if you chase someone over a certain distance it becomes a problem because they might hurt themselves fall off the bike whatever then the police have to deal with it in them obviously people have got helmets people have got clothing the bikes can be identified um slowly slowly slowly we'll create a montage of these people and we'll hone in on them and the police can do what they have to do obviously whereas the group can only provide the information as the council but we can at least give that to the police who are under-resourced and hopefully they can put together a picture and hone in on these people that are constantly doing the wrong thing thank you madam chair thank you councillor soonest um any other speakers um counselor madame I just wanted to congratulate this is a really detailed report and I hope everyone does read it but and we have to congratulate the former councillor james mcdonnell that was the one that actually found the general manager that discovered the technology and got it installed and I you know reading the report it's fascinating to see the details but you know the mobile lpr the you may as well throw out the parking meters because this is a this is better you it's everywhere so that's what the best thing is once they do the data for each shopping centre or whatever it then creates a you know that that people will start moving on like they did in my shopping centre apparently but um so I just hope that everyone it's a very detailed report and it needs to be read by everyone yeah definitely thank you council barlow councillor douglas yeah I just wanted to add um thank you for this report council and I wanted to add that I went to a community meeting with um george police this week and the new area commander jason box did uh portray that it's very important for the community to report these incidents as well apparently they have had some issues where uh shop owners in bay street haven't come forward with the details when you know that horrific hooning incident with the smoke coming out the back of bay street which unfortunately wasn't captured on these cameras at the time there were apparently a lot of shop owners and whatnot around filming it but intimidated but they can come forward later so the um the area commander did urge that as counselors we can share that information we can we can share to our constituents that if they have dash cam or cctv or photos to call up kagura police station and the police will come to them and collect a copy of it that's the best way for the community to report on these issues not to upload it to the community portal which is what I usually do when I when I have records of these issues but to directly contact the kogara police station and provide that material to them for their investigations which is complementary to these uh license plate recognition cameras thanks thank you councillor douglas all right um thank you g right of reply thank you all right we've got the motion on the screen in front of us that we receive and note the report and we look forward to future reports to to committee meetings so we can sort of see the success and as we continue to get grants and roll out more sites that have already um we know are already hot spots through our through council working with police all right so then I put the motion all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried this now takes us um we have moved item 10.456 this takes us to item 10.7 this is the review of the organizational structure there's an officer's recommendation before us to the mover and the seconder moved to councillor janssen second in council morrissey um councillor janssen would you like to speak to the motion no um are there any speakers I wasn't sure I mean I've read it and I've been through a lot of organization structures it always confuses everyone I didn't know whether the councils at some stage wanted a briefing on it to explain some of the way it's been done that was all um I don't know if it's been official or not when I was a general manager I think um yeah um I think that who would you like to through the mayor we have compiled a part of the consultation it's quite high level but it does explain in a bit more detail what functions will sit in within the various four departments I'm happy to bring that to a committee meeting if councillors are interested to see that I'd then move it goes to a gm briefing or committee meeting whatever if that's um do we have time constraints so um council obama just so that I understand um that would be additional to the officer recommendation so then it's just an additional item that just says um for information for interested counsellors are you happy to accept that um which is next week all right so that's been accepted by the mover no further discussion I put it all those in favor say aye against declare it carried okay that takes us to item 10.10 which is a response to question in relation to the management and lease of the angelo anastas aquatic center one moment sorry I'll just find my um my note um okay so um so that is just a response did you want or less a technical question I thought these responses just simply got tabled um I don't think I think you'll find that there's no there's no necessity to have these moves second and then correct yeah in fact there's no debate on these I think though that council saranovsky wanted to pull it out oh okay yeah so but I think you'll find under the local government act you're actually not permitted to debate these so I think I think you've actually just got to let the response stand I i don't think I i think you'll find the act does not permit you to debate these yes unless it's changed the response stands but um a counselor can make a comment in relation to that can they or not not technically okay I i I um reverse thank you thank you thank you councillor hannah thank you council net saranovsky unfortunately um the act prevents us speaking to the item you're just on mute counselor saronoski you're still on mute I'm afraid councillor saronoski you us all right we could raise we could find out yes so what we might do what we might do is um there'll have to be a report that will have to come to committee soon anyway because we know that the lease is nearing so um if you sorry counseling saranovsky we couldn't hear you so we'll um bring it to a committee and then we can speak to it at a committee ah now you're still on mute I'm afraid sorry sorry um we can't hear you counselor saronoski oh did you get oh it's just a question can you hear me now yes okay no I i wasn't going to debate it I just wanted to know but you've already answered it just the time frame of where council will consider those three options that's all I was going to ask thank you saranovsky so um through the chair we could take that as a question on notice um I think the answer which I can give now is that um you will be considering those options the um the time frame is mid-2023 by which the decision has to be made okay thank you all right so um and we'll have a report to the committee at the appropriate um timeline all right so we'll move to um number 11 which is the minutes the minutes of the committees so um there was a request I think counselors thank you councillors there's a request to withdraw 11.1 the minutes of the bayside traffic committee meeting on 16th of february 2022 was there a particular item okay so just give me a moment um 20 point um what was it oh 0-10 alright so the item being referred to is the bay view street and regional street vex the review and proposed replacement of rubber speed cushions with watts profile speed humps at round about the committee recommendation was that approval be given for the replacement of three rubber speed cushions with three watts profile speed humps at the roundabout of bayview street and reginald street as per um the attached drawings um council so uh I've had conversations with the immediate it the four corners of that roundabout 51 bayview 47 baby 26 bayview 24 bay a few the streets not aligned that well but that's what they are they believe that it'll impact them adversely it's already making a lot of noise vehicles coming through there especially trades vehicles with toolboxes jumping up and down because they don't like going around around them but they go right through it so is it possible to I'd like to move a change to this and move the item to an on-site meeting with the immediate neighbours and interested counsellors just to go over the finer details of this because roundabouts and speed humps have impacted a lot of people in the past and we don't need to put the community through unnecessary what's the word mark angst that's a good word I like that one word of the week unnecessary angst okay um so if we've had a conversation on site we could run the conversation of the need for it this is a this is a bit of a rat run people or nay so to speak at least they can input more directly I know there's been litter box drops and things around the area but this is an old roundabout we're just modifying it the opportunity now for them to have their say uh is in front of us so delaying it for a few weeks I can't see it being a big issue thank you council students do I have a seconder thank you councillor barlow so um if we looking at item 0 10 that we add a additional recommendation that we consult a site meeting be arranged for interested councillors to meet with the neighbours and with the appropriate council officer present all right so um all those in favor say aye against declare it carriage that then requires us now to move the full minutes of that same same traffic thank you yes so I'll just for the purposes of people listening at home this item refers to hanam street bardo valley where proposed changes to parking restrictions were made that approval be given to installing no parking 5 30 am to 30 p.m saturday to sunday along the northern curb line of hannah street between john street and wilkins street um thank you madam chair so the question I have a question firstly how was this brought about because to me it's a very long time span speaking some of the some of the people who live there they're asking the question well okay if it's a matter of mitigating traffic allowing a flow through of traffic through that part of the world we can have a break from say 5 30 in the morning till I don't know 10 o'clock and then four or five hours for people to be able to park and use the neighborhood so to speak later in the evening can I do mine counts as soon as we actually have mr morgan online excellent and um so mr morgan are you with us online excellent thank you mr morgan um we have a query in relation to um item the minutes of the traffic committee meeting on the 16th of february in relation to um 0.013 hannah street bardwell valley that decision was um put forward as a recommendation to look at parking restrictions in that street to make it flow better there's some concerns at the moment there's some restrictions through that street for the bus broker at certain times of the day vehicles are parking on both sides of the street and causing instruction so the matter that's before council tonight is a recommendation to restrict parking on one side so that service can flow through the day without having those restrictions thank you um mr morgan and that went out for community consultation didn't it yes it did no that's correct um well we can refer um that's what I'm saying if there were two or three people there what we're doing effectively we're disenfranchising one side of the street if there's a concern on from a handful of people on the other side so from memory sitting as chair of the traffic committee there was um it was distributed um there mr morgan do you have the information in front of you that indicates um how I do I can add some light on that so we did consult with residents of that area a taking loads was sent out we only received seven responses um residents were asked to consider four options which is essentially no parking on the northern side there's option one no parking on the southern side was option two uh option three was no parking on both sides and option four was to retain the existing parking as is we predominantly had uh three responses for option one which was uh on the northern side uh only one option one resident supported restrictions on the southern side two residents supported options on both sides thank you mr morgan are you comfortable with that counselor I'm comfortable with it but I'd like to ask again an on-site I'm not pressing it right because it is a big change for people they're taking away a whole heap of parking I don't have the details exactly how long but I looked at the maps on this it's a fair bit of parking and it's for a a break in the middle I can get that but it's designated pretty much designated no parking for all day from 5 in the morning till 9 at night monday to friday and the same on the weekend so if we could ask for an on-site meeting if someone would second that I'll say you know thank you thank you councillor saronosi all right we have a mover and a seconder that we um as per the previous motion that we um have an on-site meeting with interested councillors and the appropriate council officer and um interested or impacted residents so we'll um that motion is now before us um all those in favor say aye again declare it carried I are there any other items from 11.1 0.14 I'm getting this perhaps you should come to the traffic committee I wasn't allowed counsellors and welcome to the traffic committee 14 wasn't I did it for four years though no 14 yes please okay so this is um item 14 mid jubilee lane propose no parking seven sorry sorry 15 15. one below um so the committee had made three recommendations there following the consultation there and around that came about from memory in relation to the the pick-up and drop-off requirements there so there was some discussion about that is there what um is your concern with that one counselor mike thank you madam chair my concern mainly is going from three to four to three hours isn't a big game changer in this particular environment given that given the exacerbation of the parking in that precinct we've got the I don't know what the new site's called but the old daruli site whatever the new name changes become pushing cars into that precinct the sporting groups that try to use the facilities there in scarborough park um the people that that work their businesses in production having parking vehicles and all this sort of stuff all over the place if we had a dedicated and it's no attack on director of city life a dedicated group of rangers they can't_''_6879.679 be everywhere frequenting that part of the world on the weekends we could have probably a but it's not going to happen without that dedication in moving them along and and and the issue that the issue that occurs there it's all parked out kids are hopping out in amongst on the street coming through cars to get into this into the sporting ground so but got in mind if if three hours is if three hours is what the committee came up with let's at least change it to a trial period of three months and see if it doesn't make any changes but I do recommend it be a much shorter period to to get the people that live in the daryl lee site to change their ways and not park in the in that particular part of the world where we need space for people frequenting the park and we need the organizations the business people that run out of production avenue and those side streets to not park their vehicles all over the place panel beaters hire car vehicles all sorts of stuff so then um so you would like to move an amendment that um a report just based on um a review of I don't know how to do that because the sporting groups you need to sort of we need to discuss it with them because otherwise how would we get feedback how would we know not all of them though um general manager so look let's um if you're okay counselor soonest because there was quite a bit of consultation done what we can do um let's give it a little bit of time to trial it so can I suggest we say in six months time we just have a review and and have a conversation with the sporting groups and see if it's working and residents all right um do I have a seconder for that additional um six-month review second counselor hannah all those in favor say aye against declare it carried do you have any other items counselor sooners are we done well well first of all we'll do 11.1 which is the minutes of the bayside traffic committee meeting 16th of february um do I have a mover move council wider second councillor carried I now move to the minutes of the bayside traffic committee meeting on the 9th of march um council barlow zero two zero two one oh three three one okay so this is bay view street beck's the amendments to operation of a church and school located at um three three nine two three seven seven forest road I actually wanted to move it for an on-site meeting because the plans that we got are very obscure when we found out about the tree that they'll just have a little drawing around but the residents know nothing about it and I feel that it's such a big change that they really need to have that on-site meeting and the dentist on the corner you know was up was there at one stage and he had a problem someone parked in his private driveway he's gate closed the gate got broken but the person it was from the church but that's different because that was at night I don't know when it was but they found the number plate that I presume the guy it needs consultation because it's going to be a big change to the whole area and the residents know nothing about it thank you council barlow so are you happy um then so you're suggesting uh an additional recommendation there that an on-site meeting takes place with interested counsellors um impacted residents and yeah the recommendation is def deferred until we have that on-site meeting okay and and all the interested residents because they're going to be quite impacted some of them do we have any second read the plans second encounter soonest I was going to suggest as a bit of a change to that that way of having the meeting have the meeting with interested counsellors um obviously people from council offices and the church group first and then introduce the residents later because there'll be a bit of a rgb for one of a better word we need to to speak to that group because people that don't know the background of this this went to land environment court a lot of a lot of residents have had many many issues over driveways people moving bins parking in their drivers and people saying I don't care find me if you like no that's not that's not bayside yeah all right so but but in saying that we need to send a strong message out to the church that okay if these conditions are imposed that's fine however you must you must live with those conditions and not create environments where you put your own cones out and you create your own slip lanes and whatever else I'm not against the the school or the church or any organization running their business but they cannot reinvent the wheel and create different traffic environments for themselves we've had many times rangers going down there and and doing all sorts of things they need to follow the letter of the law like all of us in this room and all the wider community then we need to send that message to that meeting and then have a meeting with the wider community so they can hear it as well because they need to know that we're on the thank you thank you thank you so um just in relation to that so there was quite a bit of discussion in relation to that and it has a significant history so um I what I suggest then is that um mr morgan um looks at a potential um process where um we can meet with residents who I think other council bellows indicating really are not across what what is proposed here so maybe um you know with the expertise of council they can determine who to meet with and yeah and and plan it moving forward that way is that everyone happy with that madam man yes councillor saranovsky um I i apologize for asking this silly question but the church parishioners are human beings I don't know what the drama is in getting the residents and the church together everyone's got to live in harmony and the council to coordinate to be a facilitator so the residents can express their concerns whatever they've got in relation to this church and the school first hand to have it like a secret meeting with the church't think that's appropriate what have we got to hide let's get them all together yeah the residents and the church the human beings the residents got legitimate concerns but we can easily solve it by everybody getting together on site here in the first hand uh of um what's actually going on if I can use the church the muslim church of rockdale they're in the same situation where there's not enough parking for the parishioners that we can't_''_7340.4 be penalized in any church for the fact that their parishioners decide to go to church I think it's a good thing that people go to church but I think these issues can be easily resolved he's absorbed by having both parties on site um and hearing out their issues and where's we will be facilitating it and addressing the issues now it may be on goodwill and maybe the car park where the dentist is if maybe he might make he will show you whoever owns the build may make those pockets what's available if there is a good so my suggestion to the mover is let's have one meeting with everybody together thank you counselor sooner so I think um council bala sorry councillor saranovsky um so I think councillor barlow's original um motion was around that amendment was around that the residents don't really understand what's happening is that correct it's all about you don't want to surprise them because there's a you can't the plan is really hard to understand they've got a median iron strip for 25 we don't know where it is even the and there's moving parking spots are changing everything and I think it's quite dramatic so I feel that we have to speak to the residents because they're the ones that live there and there's this 20 metre island that I think it says it's you can get over it I don't unders as I said it's not a very good plan so really all it is it's just to explain the plans to residents and then um in the first instance so and then if any issues arise from there then we can go to next steps yeah so it's just really a consultation with the with the mapping and and the clarity around what is where all right that's fine um if I i think it's a great idea to get out there uh definitely there has been issues in the past there's no doubt um I just I've got a question to mr morgan I do know that um like councillor tunis has said it's gone to the land and environment as well as uh council traffic committee uh through you uh madame may um mr morgan if it's okay just to clarify how these recommendations came about from the land and environment court one and two just briefly if council were involved in this or negotiated this to get a positive outcome for council and residents as well as I think we might just take that question on notice if you don't mind um yeah because it's quite complex and detailed and all we're doing at this point in's all we're doing there's nothing else so there's no debating range just explaining them to the residents about what the plans that were approved by traffic committee so if everyone's happy we'll move that way all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right I now are there any other items in the traffic committee meeting good thank you so I now move that the minutes of the bay side traffic committee meeting of the 9th of march 2022 um be moved councillor naji seconded councillor fardel all those in favor say aye against declare it carried I now move to item 11.3 so this is the minutes of the city planning and environment committee meeting our very first committee meeting which was held on the the 9th of march 2022 now this has been requested to be pulled from from the other items so is there someone that would like to speak to that item council werner yes please thank you um and this is cpe double two point double zero six so just one moment if you don't about the um new approach to rezonings and the reason I wanted to pull that out so um we just need a um mover um that we um for that item someone happy to move um council fidel second in council naji okay you can speak to the item um yeah I just wanted to pull this out because I think it's a really important change that the government wants to make and I also want to uh commend um uh mayor christina curry for um I think you made a comment at that committee meeting that we um send a letter to the minister I think it's really important that our residents know what this is about um I've got some prepared notes about this that was developed by jamie parker's office because he um his one of his portfolios is planning and I think it is it is really important to note that um the government uh is concerned that site-specific re-zonings are taking too long and after consulting with industry councils and the planning profession but not the community they're proposing to the government's commitment to developer driven planning and it will erode the powers of elected community representatives on council and leaves no community in new south wales safe from over development and that's that's the problem with it so uh developers will be able to initiate and pursue re-zonings regardless of their council's view and when acting as the rezoning authority councils could face huge fines if they don't meet assessment deadlines for community input and public scrutiny will be withdrawn the government will create a right of appeal for developers who are dissatisfied with a rezoning decision but there will be no right of appeal for residents or local councils who wish to challenge a re-zoning approval councils will no longer work with a proponent prior to lodgement and gateway determinations will be removed which means that the strategic merit of a proposal will no longer be assessed to decide whether or not an application should proceed and this cuts out the precious opportunity for public oversight and community engagement so um I just wanted to uh make those comments because um you know think it's it's good to just um emphasize those aspects thank you yeah no thank you council werner and thank you for pulling that out because what that what is proposed is an absolute disgrace they want to take away decision making from local councils so where now we have an opportunity to have a say on whether a planning proposal is moves forward or not that takes that away so that does not give council any opportunity to put forward their views on it and it is only us council staff and residents who truly understand the impact of planning proposals as well so what they're what they're proposing is totally unjust and um it's another example of um just taking decision make decision making away from people so you know I think that um and we're very clear at the committee meeting that um you know we we really express will we condemn that um proposal actually because it is not in the best interests of our community or any community across the state so thank you uh matami yes mr uh a point five um that we write to the local government association and ask them to take up uh with the minister um my understanding is I think it's every week or every two weeks uh the president of the association meets up with the government officials um I'm sure they're totally against this but if we can just formally write to them and ask them to make representations on our behalf great suggestion great suggestion councillor saranovsky I'm councillor fardelli you happy to accept that yep thank you we'll um make that we'll add that there thank you council narus saronoski are there any for the speakers councillor douglas madame there was a slight amendment to the minutes that fausto was reviewing I'm not sure if that has come forward yet what's that in relation to councillor douglas 2204 we had a significant discussion about bike tracks and um not relegating bike tracks to secondary streets and it was my understanding from the meeting that we took up up the general manager's suggestion that bike tracks uh only be relegated division between traffic and bikes on main streets so are you referring to the draft submission in relation to design and place state environmental planning policy yes thank you councilwinner so um douglas oh my goodness sorry um yeah so that's the um that's the next item so we'll just um deal with the original um the earlier item which was um zero from the um zero zero six the submission is there any further discussion there so um well that's received and noted so we don't need to um change anything oh we're adding cancer saranovsky's so um we have a mover to council council saranovsky moves seconded councilwater all those in favor say aye against declare it carried um now we can now move towards um the item so um um sorry yes you've forgotten me I pulled out I think you have I think I pulled out cpe 22.003 yep so we'll go coming to that we'll come to that thank you thank you so we're still on um councillor douglas has pulled out zero zero clarification around um bike bike ride um bike paths so that was to be added to the submission from and um I have reviewed the video footage and fausto has agreed that it would be added but it hasn't been added yet so I don't know what the correct process for that is but I wanted to flag it okay so um counselor douglas are you happy then if um we add that second point which was discussed in the meeting that we're full and safe that we're full and safe separation cannot be achieved the cycleway network should be prioritized in secondary streets yes I'm happy with that thank you thank you so that was um that was one of the original um can we just have a little clarity around that madam chair when we say cycle separate or cycle cycleway networks is that a formalized cycleway with dedicated lanes for cycling or is it on a map that says go down this street you can because you're a bike because we've painted bicycle or cymbals on the ground because I cycle along um the grand parade and there's that that's not deemed the cycleway our lock always are our footpaths and so on along the grand parade or secondary streets this this was purely in relation to a submission that was being made so um all it does is that it says that um you know we consider this when um in any future you know that it be considered in any future planning so there's quite a lot of clarity around what we're saying so we're on the same page when we move forward because there are dedicated software ways that we have in our lga not that they're very good because they're a lot of disconnection but we also have a map that says you can cycle here which is it isn't a formalized cycle way because there's parked cars there there's all sorts of impediments but we call it a cycleway okay it's when we're planning new cycleways it's the dedicated cycleways well yeah so as part of our um you know there is so it's that's what that's about yes yep all right so um we we have made that um moved councillor douglas seconded council werner all those in favor say aye against declare it carriage so they've been added uh now we have another item in those minutes for councillor hannah thank you madam mayor this relates to um 22.003 the draft local heritage grant policy yes now this fell out of a resolution of council on the 9th of february 2022 now that resolution had a 0.3 my question is this this is silent on 0.3 so my question is is point three in the pipeline uh if it is in the pipeline can I please have a date when point three will be discussed and come to council can I ask you to clarify what point three is because most definitely and this was my this is my piggyback uh amendment that in fact was agreed to by the movers of the motion and it's point number three which says that council provide a report back to council regarding reinstating the annual house of on sympathetic restoration and or additions so if this hasn't been discussed at the committee level my question is when is it going to be discussed because this has been bundled into a resolution of counsel and as you know madam mayor I'm a firm believer in truth in sentencing yeah thank you counselor hannah so from memory that um the in relation to that did you look at the attached report which articulated the information in there no is it in there because it's certainly not in the it's certainly not from memory from memory I thought we had discussed that but if you will give us a moment we will just go back and see if we can find the detail in the report it was item three um so can I can we just clarify counselor hannah when it was raised at the original meeting was that part of a reporter or a question that was part of the resolution was it emotion though yeah it was a notice of motion put forward by council of serafinovsky and barlow and the the resolution right number yes so it's point number three of that actual resolution of council um thank you yeah well have a look thank you kevin it would have been the first meeting yeah ninth of february uh madame councillor hannah is 100 right thank you councillor we'll just cross check it on the document so we can add that or the next committee report thank you councillor hannah so it is technically still a resolution from that original motion so even though it wasn't part of the committee report it is still a resolution of council therefore it has to be acted upon so it it still stands although it wasn't in that report it still stands that as part of the original motion that council will um report back regarding reinstating the annual house of the year awards so at the next appropriate committee we'll have a report that provides that information thank you all right are there any other anything else from those minutes all right um would someone have it move those minutes be accepted move counselor naji second and counselor jansen oh thank you all right so now we're going to um move to the notices of motion and um the next notice of motion is in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation plan and I do believe that um we did have a registered speaker who has now arrived so that was good timing mr bell so I invite you to come up and um and this item is 12.3 and we have mr stephen bell affected neighbor speaking for the motion so just to reiterate because you weren't here earlier you've got five minutes to um state your points please and there will be a one minute warning bill thank you very much thank you as the chair pointed out I am a concerned neighbor I've been living in banks here with my family for just four years um but I'm also an advisor to banks insurers and wealth management companies on climate change I've got a history advising insurance companies on physical risk and I've got to say it was really pleasing to see this come onto the agenda tonight putting forward the motion um it's the type of motion that is sorely missed in a lot of local government areas and I think it's an opportunity for leadership by bayside council werner in the motion has put forward two potential examples of climate change risk management plans those are good examples those are examples that the industry looks at positively but I'd like to make five points tonight the first being that those examples while they are fantastic and while they should be recognized as best practice of this day they shouldn't be recognised as the standard upon which the council should be aiming to achieve we need within our community to to really recognise not just the the physical risks that are uh are at play within our local area but also the um the financial opportunities sorry financing opportunities that we have within our community to make our communities safer the second point that I'd like to raise is that I think we're all very well aware that banks insurers and others are researching this very issue they're spending millions spending millions of dollars to better understand this issue banks and insurers are not doing it for ideological reasons and nor should we banks and insurers just like this council should be doing it because they know that there is a cost and there is a cost to inaction and so I would implore the council and our community to support this this motion and the subsequent work in full I think a lot has changed since the since the the climate mitigation risk mitigation plan has been put forward by wollongong um and bayside down in victoria and the bayside uh plan itself is actually a really good example because bayside suffers down in victoria suffers from quite a lot of flood risk it's also got a really mixed social economic profile just like our own community there are homes within bayside that will be inundated by by rising seas just as that there are areas within bayside here in new south wales that will also be inundated by rising seas within our lifetime and the point that I'd like to raise is that often these risks't insure land so there may well be individuals here tonight their assets that perhaps they might pass them to their children will not be able to be insured unless action is taken today now it's not all doom and gloom since those two action plans that council werner has put forward were published a lot has actually changed our federal government has committed hundreds of millions of dollars in support for mitigation programs but the gap there for local councils is on understanding what your ask is and so the first step that you need to take is to develop the plan just like that that's been put forward you can't access that funding unless you've got a very clear idea of what your vulnerability is not your risk what your vulnerability is and what you need to do to make your your residents safer the last thing that I'd like to just raise this evening is the governments in the private sector are already funding risk mitigation don't just think about funding sources coming from state and federal governments through grant that has global capital mobilizing for this exact reason working alongside some of our bigger banks who they're also they've also got a part to play in this they don't want to see their collateral at risk so you can reach out beyond governments beyond state and federal governments to actually solve this issue and to round out I think it's a wonderful opportunity for our council in our community to show leadership in australia we've got leadership up in the sunshine coast in this very same issue in queensland we've got leadership up on the central coast of new south wales all the way down to bayside as council learner and others have put forward so I would encourage you to invest in this it is a it is an impulse on on council resources but without this investment our community will be at risk thank you I think I hit time straight on yeah that was perfect and thank you for the opportunity my apologies no thank you mr bell for joining us and um sharing that information with us tonight councillors on the organizational structure and I'm pleased to note as you would have seen in the organizational structure that one of the priorities in the proposed structure is the creation of an environment and resilience team so that's bringing together staff from strategic planning resource recovery and the general managers unit so this unit is something that will be established this financial year and it will focus on building on the range of environmental initiatives that our staff are already working on and which I described in detail on my merrell minute last council meeting and again tonight in relation to the renewable energy so there's a lot of work being done and I'm pleased to see the proposal in the general manager's report there is that focus to increase our capacity in what the in this important area and I'm advised that their first priorities will when this new team is formed as part of the new organizational structure will include and um and are already working towards an urban forest plan for bayside and a climate mitigation plan so those things are highlight that to counsellors and to people listening that um there's a lot of work being done here particularly so um we do have a motion before us um so I have a mover council werner a seconder councillor douglas uh would you like to speak to the motion council werner um thank you so um uh first of all thanks so much for um for coming along um mr bell it was a really um detailed and important information so yeah thanks for that um yeah so I just want to emphasize that this is about a plan that's not just about mitigation it's also about adaptation as well so um and it's having an overall plan um can also show us what our vulnerabilities are and and I think that that's that's um one of the things that I um took from from from what you said is that that's really important we need to know what our vulnerabilities are so that we can get the funding to address those because you know what we've seen is that floods most severe that we've ever seen and together with the 2019 bushfires and the pandemic and these are the kinds of events that are made worse by climate change and as I said on the 9th of february this year the insurance council of australia has made a public statement on climate change which reads in part climate changes occurring along a rapid and severe pathway and without intervention it presents a serious risk to environments economies and communities worldwide the impacts of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are becoming increasingly evident through the occurrence of more frequent and intense extreme weather events sea level rise and global mean temperature increase now the thing is um I also want to say that it's wonderful what bayside council is already doing and I think it's really important to have that you know unit that group of people working on resilience and things like that I also want to commit commend the mayoral minutes from today and would like to acknowledge the significance of the new 100 renewable energy contract that council has recently entered with the southern sydney regional climate change but it doesn't actually address the adaptation um side of it so at our ninth of february meeting uh councillor tsoonis asked what we're proposing to do in response to the evidence on climate change so that's that's why I had a look at the the plans that other councils have made and uh I'm not saying that I know what the answer is but I think this is something that that is really worthwhile for uh council staff to have a look at and we don't have to reinvent the wheel so um to save time and other resources we can learn from and build on what uh the climate mitigation and adaptation plans of others um and um of course that the two ones that I had a look at was the wongong council's 2020 to 2022 climate change mitigation plan and the victoria's bayside city council climate emergency action plan 2020 to 2025. they're both very detailed and they've got practical and actionable items that will make a difference and I recommend that bayside council climate change mitigation and adaptation plan the general manager has made a comment that it would take substantial amount of staff time and research and internal consultation which I think is very important and I want to suggest that making a climate change mitigation adaptation plan would be a most valuable valuable use of our staff's time and as I've said before failing to plan is planning to fail we know that the climate is changing and that the effects of climate change will become more severe and that this poses a serious risk to environments economies and communities including our own community here in bay side and surely protecting our local communities in any way that we can is the most important or one at least one of the most important things that we can do so and it's also what the state government expects us to do so um the net zero plan states that um achieving net zero emissions uh will require more than action from state and commonwealth governments and it requires action from local government businesses communities and individuals so this would own actions and ways that we can collaborate with businesses and community groups and individuals to adapt to climate change and I hope that you support this motion thank you thank you council werner are there any other speakers council barlow I congratulate greta for being so passionate about it but I believe that we actually should defer it because of the note that having this new unit and I feel like we putting the cart before the horse and we really need to um look at it and because of the the department is changing so the council is starting to look at it but you can't just take staff from everywhere and start doing it when we're going to have a specialised unit so I would actually move an amendment that this is deferred until we have our presentation with the new organisation structure and find out exactly what this and this unit becomes established so you're really jumping the gun if you approve this today tonight so um council werner councillor barlow's got a suggestion um to amend that to defer it would yeah so you so um so you're happy to um accept that that we defer this until you know the the new structure is um more information's been provided and the new structure starts to form all right um so that's been um accepted and so do we have a secondar thank you councillor awada um is there any further discussion I'd like to ask a question I can see there's two plans up there and oh look I'm I'm not saying I'm a skeptic or otherwise there is climate change occurring at the rate is the conversation how fast it's occurring okay my question is why do we need to develop our own localized action plan or mitigation plan we have neighbouring councils shouldn't we do this in in collusion with others because surely our plan would be very similar to one at george's river would be very similar to the one at sutherland at randwick and so on because we have the same issues I i just don't understand why we have to invest individually go plan that will tell us okay the sea level will rise again it's an arbitrary thing because there's no scientific specific scientific testing for our part of the world there is a more global situation for new south wales and sydney and there will be sea level rise in the future but wouldn't be a constant right across new south wales that's what I don't get why we have to invest and I would imagine this would go into the millions to to develop this sort of action plan why don't_''_9576.16 we develop it through a collusion with the new south wales government and through our local local councils all the other councils that are facing the same issues along the coast I'm not going to say the council that's out at broken hill has the same issues but the council's within 20 kilometers of us along the coast have the same have the same concerns so that's that's just a question I'm just putting it out there I don't know the answer to that and it and do our own thing where there are organizations that we can work with such as um cooks river alliance and all those other organizations that look at specific things ss rock we need to develop a plan that encompasses the entire coastline or maybe maybe 100 kilometers either side of where we are I don't know the the ins and outs of what happens up at the tweed heads I don't know what happens down at aladdulla but I know what happens within our part of the world surely must be similar so why would each why does each council have to reinvent its own wheel yeah council souness thank you when we um have a future report that comes to committee we can have a bit more information and detail to try and understand you know what that looks like across councils and and so on so all right um is there any further discussion uh yes I would like to thank the speaker and I think that this is a really important issue and our micromex research as part of the community strategic plan showed change and this is something that is important to them but based on the information in the motion um from the gm as well as the organisational restructure and previous information I would be supporting councillor barlow's amendment because I believe this perfectly aligns to what that new expert business unit would be doing so I would be um supportive of that business unit being tasked with the request to do the initial research and present back to committee some options on what the scope of a climate change um mitigation and adaption plan may entail so that thank you thank you councillor jansen um is it further councillor douglas um I know at the february 9th meeting we also made a decision to have a climate change information session for councillors and I would just ask that we perhaps revisit what why a climate mitigation plan is important for local council to address councillor soonest's question at that information session as well yeah thank you councillor douglas we can sort of see all the moving parts now coming together and and um you know all the things it's all coming together really well with the new unit where they can have that that um specialist um oversight and clear direction all right so that we have a um an amendment there and um so the um we had a a mover and a seconder for the amendment and um so all those in favor of the amendment say aye against declare it carried so um the amendment um then becomes the motion so now we um vote on the motion so all those I beg your pardon um councillor werner yeah no no that's fine apologies councilwinner please um okay right of reply thank you very much um yeah so I mean I am disappointed that this is getting you know putting back um you know uh that we're not doing it straight away because I think time is of the essence with this um but I think it is the the most important thing is that we do make a plan that it's not just sort of individual things that we're doing and it's not just okay we're putting there what we need is an overall plan we need to know those um individual you know the vulnerabilities and one of the reasons why we do I think need our own plan um that is um that has the detail about our specific area it's not just sort of um you know an overall new south wales plan is because um we do have specific vulnerabilities there are certain areas that get flooded more than others you know there are certain areas that are closer to the um uh you know closer to the beach whatever like there's there's different um areas and um so we we need to know those specific details so that we can uh get the funding um to to you know to adapt and to to do the things that we need to do to keep our residents safe so I think for that reason it is really important that we do have our own plan but of course if there's any economies of scale where we can work with other councils like maybe ss rock again or other groups um but the the most important thing is is that we do have a plan and and that we do have it um as soon as possible thank you thank you council werner all right so we are now um the amendments um can I just ask a question man through to council werner through through you if it's okay and don't put you on the spot there's been funding mentioned by the speaker and yourself what what is the funding what will that cover will it cover the actual development of the plan or implementation of initiatives do you know what the funding will cover thank you all right so no further speakers the amendment becomes emotional vote on the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right that leaves us um with the next notice of motion um this is motion 12.4 this is um so can um this one is looking at um some reset investigation into a potential pump track in sir joseph um banks so we have that motion on the screen in front of us he the councilor morrissey and um so so um councillor janssen would you like to speak to the motion so thank you councillor soon it's a pump a price a pump track is a a worldwide phenomenon that's not really um hit australia yet but it is a facility that engages young people and because of the nature of the facility it can be accessed by all sorts of things that can be ridden so not just bicycles it can be accessed by skateboards by scooters but even by people on wheelchairs so this is simply asking for an accessible facility for young people there were a number of groups that were established during lockdown so there's currently a group of 300 that exists on social media that has been advocating for this facility there's another group on instagram that has around 200 members in support of a pump track there is no pump track nearby so I am believing that this would act as a kind of a regional center for all of bayside so this motion is just asking for an investigation into a potential aid with their mental health and well-being and um and that our report be report provided back to the relevant committee thank you thank you council jansen any other speakers councillor douglas I bloody love this motion I really do I really want to see your pump track and I want to see another pump track over our side of the bay uh I am desperate to get out there with my kids well it is actually when you're a cyclist you can't ride very safely between kaima and botany through the tunnel it's like a nightmare so there is a bit of a divide because quite hard for me as a cyclist to get to botany but yeah I want to see these for the kids for the adults I think that kids are bored they they need to get off the screens we need to give them things to do that are local that are free um that build their skills to do other things other than illegal activities or hooning or whatnot so I i just love this motion so much and I've on this side of the bay so we could have one on either side and I agree with you that it will bring people from other areas it will put us on the map for parents for families to come and visit and you only have to go down to the skate park at west botany street to see people come for that facility whole families come they they come and watch their daughters skate they watch their sun skate they film each other's skate it's become just this beautiful community space and it's it's different to a skate park so thank you for bringing the most in council thank you councillor douglas councillor musket yes I just like to raise the fact that as a council we need to be responsible in this area because the local children are designing and making their own versions of a pump track in the parks so for safety issues I think it's vital that we support this motion thank you councilman any further discussion all right I'll put it just to just a question I'm fully cover any liability and insurance ramifications yes there's any costs associated with that as with the state park and so on everything's carefully considered um council barlow I was only going to make a comment to say I have learned something tonight I've never heard of a pump track not having grandchildren and only having bmx tracks in my backyard so very similar we'll go very different no I haven't got it now but I used to have it and the whole neighborhood came all right thank you councillors therefore I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now have um a motion um in front of us which is 12.5 which is um transport for new south wales consultation with residents of o'connell street and corford road brighton sands I'm a mover um councillor saronoski seconded councillor awada um is there any discussion uh madame I just wanted firstly um I've just received a text from councilman google who's asked that uh he be um accepted as an apology he's tied formally accept his apology thank you councillor saronoski did you want to speak to 12.5 it's uh it's madame it's pretty simple um it's outlined in a very brief notification um translation wales refused to talk to the residents of o'connell street crawford road which is pretty stupid um the government agency they're supposed to be working for us we pay their wages we pay the taxes they blatantly refuse to talk to the residents now we've got concerns or seeking clarification in terms of the um the construction of the m6 toll which is blown out uh double what it was budgeted before so all we're asking council is to endorse dwight to the government asking the minister to ask the transfer in new south wales to at least have a dialect with the residents on a regular basis okay thank you councillor sara nascani for the discussion just a comment um there was an m6 meeting for the moorfields estate which is on the other side which is impacted they said they contacted everyone no they didn't I don the manager yes I was thought I went there thinking are they going to create parking behind the shops with the loss of parking oh no they'll just see to talk to everyone they were surprised that there was that many people there because the estate council and there's a community group there that letterboxed everyone I said how did you contact the people are we door knocked somebody got a letter in one letter box but no one got one further up the street so I believe they have a meeting every week or every couple of weeks with council do they thems they said they had meetings with council there are regular meetings okay right called that the next meeting could you ask how they correspond with the residents because I'm sorry they've said that they did all this no one knew about it it was done virtually the residents contacted everybody to let them know um so it was disappointing I think they they were in shock that there's that many people there but they need to be asked continually how they how they notified the mortals estate who they notified because there was one house down one end of president avenue halfway up none at the other end of the street so it's a matter of they've got to be more caring because it's going to impact those residents the whole lot so yeah it will thank you council butler we'll make sure I too was at that meeting that street meeting or the park meeting and it was all all about keeping people informed there was just some placards you could ask some questions but if it was anything too complicated there was no answer to it it is what it is we're going to have to wear this I feel sorry for the people in that particular street and in some of the other streets heading south because the conversation around that is when you ask so what's the impact on the people beyond president avenue which is which by the way is going to be is it six meters it's going to be raised or three nine meters it's going three three meters no no six because three from the bottom anyway it's all platitudes it's the same issue we had when we had the conversation around the m5 tollway they just palm you off palm you off palm you off constantly and for the people that live south of president avenue there's going to be a lot of pain with a lot of rat running that people aren't aware of tutor avenue is going to be chock-a-block forget about cycleways on there and that's one of the areas that there will be a problem thank you um and just to make the point um I think council bala was at the traffic committee with me when they presented and were very clear that traffic committee around the appropriate community consultation and they had actually assured us um which yeah which is um quite disappointing so again we'll will reiterate the importance of um speaking with all residents that are going to be impacted and improved the community consultation and we're also very clear that the impact string works and um the amenity those things and then at the completion of the project that they restore the area to an outstanding standard um because you know that so there's a lot a lot in there so we'll certainly um continue to put that pressure on them yeah councillor winner yeah not american sorry um councilwoman then councillor saranovsky um yeah so I i went to the um that uh sort of community consultation and voter commerce as well and um the thing is that uh they are planning a bike path that um sort of to make up for um you know some of the um effects that are going to be on local residents and um which is good um but some of that bike path also goes through some endangered ecological communities as well and and um I was just wondering um there's also an opportunity to uh increase connectivity though with some of the other bike paths one of the people there said that um they could organize a meeting with councillors so that we can unders better understand what some of those um effects are and still working on that bike path I mean the the land has already been allocated but just some of the more detailed design it would be really good to to um to get some more information and for counsellors to be updated on that as well okay thanks councilwoman we can request some um more detail around those all right um no further discussion um all those in fact you just say aye oh sorry counselor sorry please go ahead you have right of reply as well I agree with everything that's been said um just two things um when we do approach the transforming south wales if they can consider not holding meetings at four o'clock because most people either pick up their children or they're still at work um and if they could do it on a saturday morning um well it's more convenient for more residents but I kind of just remind the council transport new south wales initially when they announced the m6 wanted to give bayside council zero I repeat zero in community facilities it's only because mr camper our where mr campbell kept raising the parliament almost on a daily base and they got sick and tired of hearing him and they called him in and said what do you want us to do for you because transport new south wales councillors they don't care about us they didn't take any of our suggestions and you're right council butler they're going to kill off the shops on prison over you they'll lose all the parking spots and they're all small family-owned businesses they don't want to contribute to anything um so in a nutshell uh if we can when we do speak to transport news I know they hate me but that's okay uh I'm there to fight for the residents and when we do hot when they do have their so-called tick boxes of meeting with the residents that will be at a reasonable time where uh the residents can turn up and if they can be on a saturday morning or saturday afternoon because most people have got jobs nine to five and they hold the lead at and council one of your hunts there was little there was no notification it was only because council a former council field and facebook um you know um and um were aware of it and then in our notification casper you saw us aren't interested in talking to the residents there and all they want to do is get information to put their minds at ease thank you counselors now well said good point um councillor saranovsky so um we'll add that in our in communications with them all right that takes us so um all in all all those in favor say aye against declare it carried um this takes us to 12.6 this is a notice of motion for traffic measures for emeline street rams gate beach and movies council saranovsky second chancellor morrissey um is there any discussion um I i met with the residents as well uh they approached us at the merrell mobile office mobile office thank you madame um and it is as said in the motion that there are numerous illegal uh turns being made into emeline street it's a and the uh the residents have asked that they either the street be blocked off entirely or some sort of measures taken to stop these illegal turns coming into the street uh I rode past that uh street on my way home from the mobile office and it was very clear that there were very large uh drag racing burnout marks along the street it's visually evident that people are using this strip uh because it is a long straight strip for social nuisance behavior public nuisance behaviour so I and you know and and there's also very little uh sidewalk on that street so it does have a congestion effect of fast moving vehicles moving illegally and coming the wrong way congested with pedestrians who are trying to walk without a footpath an adequate footpath and apparently the street is also used a lot for people going to the beach as well so it puts families at risk yeah okay thank you um councillor douglas all those in favor say aye against do you want right of reply council saranovsky okay um against no um I declare um I believe um there's a petition to be presented um tonight councillor awada did you want to sure speak to that sure uh thank you madame uh look I've got a petition uh thanks with the mobile office we had at bexley last saturday good turnout local president I think some of the residents spoke about the increase in traffic on stoney creek road and forest road and as we know and I think they've spoken to councillor hannah councillor balo a few residents came with different issues now obviously the m5s the introduction of toll have caused all this we knew so an email was sent I think it's been also a petition with that it's been received by resident living at salisbury avenue and they put a petition sir to have a prevent the right turn out of the salvia avenue because a lot of traffic is going into the inside streets avoiding the traffic on forest road so um I believe mr morgan has got a copy of the petition as well as the email and I'm told that the to the corporate performance committee first so I'd like to present you with the petition tonight thank you councillor all right um we now move to item 13. um this is questions questions with notice are there any questions with notice um counselor douglas I have put three questions of notice forward um they're up on the screen do I need to read them out no that's fine thank you so um for counsellors interest um those questions are listed there thank you um are there any further questions with notice council werner I've got a question can I send it through to the minute keepers um who would because fausto is not here so who would I send it to um send it to michael mamo okay thank you yeah thank you and we can add that then on to the agenda are there any other questions we've noticed all right there being no further questions with notice um there's no other no confidential reports um therefore counsellors I close the meeting at 10 13
No all right so um we are now back in open session okay thank you councillors the resumption of open council meeting now that the closed session meeting has finished I move that the meeting resumes into open session of council is there a secondary we've already done that oh wonderful thank you deputy mayor um all right in that case I call on the general manager please to announce the resolutions carried in the closed session so um so for the record um I can note that items one to five are as printed on the council business paper council resolved that way with the addition of item six and item six reads that a report be made to the next appropriate committee on the outcomes of the repayment plan progressed proposed by the lessee talk about small oh yeah so that's the additional point um that's been added to what was on the business paper thank you everybody thank you general manager all right there being no further business thank you councillors I declare the meeting closed at 9 18. thank you yeah that's because someone put in not so nominal
Good afternoon sally anne and thank you for joining us for our very special international women's day version of talking bayside tuesday it's wonderful to have you with us thanks ronnie thanks very much for the opportunity the invitation and I'm really looking forward to talking with you this afternoon fantastic well let's get into it um I'll start with international women's day sally ann what does the day mean to you personally yeah thanks ronnie um so so I think international women's day gives me personally a chance to reflect and take a moment you know life is so busy and we get caught up in so many different things and trying to stay on top of everything but I think having a day itself really gives me a chance to uh sort of reflect on the times of the past how far we've come and and you know to be quite frank how far we've still got to go um I have a mother who's an incredibly creative person and in the 50s actually also a um a said to her father I'd like to be a sign writer and his response immediately was no women don't climb letters and uh he was a lovely man and it's no reflection on him but you know that we have come so far but it's important to reflect on you know the journey and and to use I guess to use um you know the past to really push on it and keep gender equality uh you know being pushed forward so yeah that's that's sort of my personal take a moment and and reflect that's great and you obviously grew up in the local community mother mother from ramsgate uh my family did not me but um I made my way back you must like it here then I do yeah so it's a wonderful community really really special place and and let's face it it's also an absolutely beautiful spot so yes it most certainly is although it's a bit wet today um sally and it's interesting that you you say about how far we've last few years that that we don't necessarily have any gender inequality at the moment simply because women have made so many strides across all fields and across all sectors um across all levels of society how do you feel about this and and just thinking about your own work with the organizations you're involved with how do you work within those organizations to affect change yeah so look ronnie I definitely um can see change I i certainly don't think that we're in a no longer um you know general like a completely fair um gender equal situation I think we still have a long way to go um I think we can see great achievements from women throughout our society and and I guess just sort of going back to your first question international women's day allows us to really celebrate um and build the momentum uh you know on their achievements and I think when we're talking about the organizations that I'm involved in the most important thing is just really sort of stay focused on um you know bringing things are so so important and um yeah I think um those those are the things that we need to engage with ongoing um I think we definitely need to consider how we measure gender balance and I and I think measuring gender balance enables us to um keep our eye on you know the the future because whilst we can learn from the past this really is about keeping our eye on the future and um and driving forward to ensure that um you know we do have uh gender equality um you know at the forefront and as I said I think um the diversity of thought uh you know is really really important within these organizations to build that so yeah yeah no you're right and that having that momentum um I think is an important point just paraphrasing our first and so far only woman prime minister julia gillard who once said uh that having one woman prime minister is not a measure of success it's having a succession of women prime minister so again in that theme of keeping the momentum going so and apparently you are only the second woman director in clubs new south wales 90 plus year history how do you think that those organizations can ensure that you are not that one-off but that we do keep that momentum going and that you become that trailblazer for many women to come after you yeah thanks ronnie um I guess overall my opinion on that is education it's a it's a constant piece of education um we need to ensure that we're governing all of our organizations with diversity and inclusion and if we can um you know use the current research out there that talks about improvements in productivity and results in all of those things that um you know sort of drives our all of those organizations to be sustainable you know into the future then I think um yeah look I i think then we're on our way it's really about ensuring that everybody is represented um and that there's an education piece right through those organizations yeah so I i will just um I will let you know that we 100 years in 2020 unfortunately covert got in the way of all of those celebrations but yes we're the club industry is over 100 years old which is um something to be very proud of and um yeah so I i guess the only other thing that I would add to that sort of is also you know you you can't_''_371.84 be what you can't see it's cliched around at times and um I think we all just need to uh in terms of being a child laser I guess and it's not it's not not a word that I would resonate with but it's I understand um so I think it's important that we uh you know we're seen and as women we you know sort of amplify the you know the achievements of everyone around us so yeah yeah now that's um that's good 100 years that that is an achievement yeah um so that you know can't_''_405.6 can't_''_406.08 be what you can't see um ethos I guess just thinking about some of our that gender equity particularly with with that sort of senior management and leadership levels what advice would you have for the leaders of those organizations yes so I guess in my mind it's a bit like fronting up to a brick wall and you know it's one brick at a time um with the overall the mission is to you know remove the brick wall all together and um I think it's it's about accepting that we're on a journey and again it's that momentum piece and you know really pushing it traditional baggage and you're rightly a wrong leaf that's how old term it it's hard to move and sometimes it feels unfair but it's definitely a journey that we're on and we need to sort of stay the course of that journey and we need to be strong and we need to be continually reminding everyone around us that um we're on the journey and and you know what our path is what our our goals are I think the thing for um leaders of organizations's around you know the research that's showing us how important diversity and inclusion is and to really keep that data at the forefront of all governing bodies you know of these organizations to to really use it to inform um you know the pathways uh so that so that we can make change and and keep pushing forward um I'll just add I guess when I was thinking about when I think about advice I mean I'm personally still unsure about quotas on one hand you know it sets up the argument ongoing that women haven't achieved their roles by merit and I simply just don't agree with that but on the other hand quotas are used to stretch uh you know like a traditional mindset and and perhaps they do have a place to start really pushing uh you know the forward that that conversation so um it's interesting that you know in my personal opinion there's very little conversation ever around um merit in terms of uh you know the male lens um and I guess that's just another of gender inequality particularly in the workplace but I but I you know I accept that um there's a conversation going on around leadership and um and quotas and and um you know gender inequality I would just um just one small anecdote I the morning after I was appointed to the club's new south wales board there was a high-profile radio announcer that uh decided that he would at that point say you know if you're a woman appointed to a board really at this time you would know that you didn't get it on merit and you you I mean he didn't use the word ashamed but he you know he was intimating that so obviously I strongly disagree with that I think again it comes back to that you can't_''_604.399 be what you can't see and I would like to think I i have three daughters and I would like to think that um you know they are watching and uh and I'm leading for them if not if nothing else so thank you for that um and if measuring gender balance and how important that was was that did you have quotas in mind when you when you were thinking about that um not initially no um the the measurement of gender balance really um you know across board papers and and um you know understanding is really just about keeping that that conversation front of mind it's it's not something that should be buried and it's something that that really if you're looking at it and you're measuring it then it you are you know it does help you focus on on the end result um often these things if they're not on an agenda for example can sort of become an afterthought and and that it's critical that gender inequality does not become what gender equality does not become um you know an afterthought so okay fantastic um so just doing a bit of a deeper dive now into into some of your uh your leadership positions so you do you do have an interesting position I guess in your role with the ramsgate rsl and with the bayside straddling I guess both of both of those uh organizations in their own way um are gender exclusive so the the rsl club I guess still rightly or wrongly have that perception of being male dominated domains while with the women's shelter understandably primarily run for and by women um so I guess with that in in mind how is the ramsgate rsl challenging that perception yeah thanks ronnie um I guess you know there's a traditional frame that says that uh as an rsdell you know the the view of an rsl is very male dominated and I and I guess as I said traditionally that's because you know that these um rsls and and ramsgate in particular was started by a group of um you know like-minded return servicemen and and women um in order that they would have a place to gather and to you know to discuss the things that they'd been involved in in their theaters of war and and uh you know sort of that was their community but I think the interesting part about ramsgate rsl and and a is that we have a high membership of women and fema you know females and and in fact we know that women are the major decision makers in and around our club so it's it's an interesting sort of um uh I guess anchor to the to the past and um you know we're very much focused at ramsgate on ensuring that you know our representation particularly on our governing board which is at the moment of 29 our senior leadership team is over 50 it's really about um you know it's the diversity of the community that we need to reflect and uh whilst there are some perceptions uh that that that may not have changed I i can assure you that it's definitely on the agenda I guess the other thing too we work with is our partners in the rsl new south wales the head office and our sub branch um the most important thing is that we continue to encourage and show leadership within our community and that's you know certainly something that I'm very proud of at the perception and we do that by you know sort of welcoming our community into you know our club and um providing a safe and equal experience it's not just about you know one gender or the other it's about the whole community and um and it's about being I like to say it's about being the light on the hill for the movement um for the tradition and we can certainly do that by reflecting the diversity of our community and I mean you know like all communities there's a lot of um you know there's change and uh you know it's just about being open-minded and making sure that everyone feels welcome so yeah I guess the flip side of that as you did say was um the wonderful bayside women's shelter and you know a truly truly uh valuable service to our community as well I guess from a uh a gender lens with the shelter we you know our women's shelter we're a family shelter so we are caring for women and children that are escaping trauma informed service requirements however I would say that we are embracing um the gents in our world um via our um our governing structure so across our um our own board our own voluntary board but also our partner in women's community shelters we have some exceptional men that have become allies for the advocacy of our um you know of our work uh domestic and family violence is absolutely heinous violence and it really is about um you know providing uh you know sort of the care for our women and our children um but we do have some wonderful wonderful men walking alongside us which is really important and uh I guess the only thing I would um sort of draw to a close on that conversation is that it's not just one gender that can be the the solution to a terrible community problem it's all of us together so yeah and I think that's been an important message that's come through in recent years hasn't it that we do need to have to have men as part of the so sally ann just um you mentioned about having men involved within your service but at the governance level do you see perhaps and this it may not be appropriate but do you see that there might be another role for men at sort of different levels of the service provision yes so I guess we I mean yes there's always room to understand and to work you know with everybody in the service I think probably where I was talking about in terms of the trauma informed is you know we have a residence and um we need to be you know careful about how uh you know we work with our women and their children around you know sort of moving them the the refuge the shelter itself is a um crisis accommodation refuge so um once you know we've we've moved our women through the initial sort of crisis time we do look to put them in transitional housing and you know um across all of that it requires the you know sort of the involvement and the assistance of our community and that with men and women um you know to to help you know in that process it's it it's for our women initially it's about sort of um I guess it's it's wrapping our arms around them so that they can take a breath and start reimagining what's going on for them and where they want um you know their safe and independent lives to restart um so probably not in the you know the early stages but definitely it's a partnership with the shelter um across the whole community equally so yeah yeah great and just circling back to um your role with with the rso I guess there's also that link too isn't there with you know men who might be coming back from from conflict and experiencing torture and trauma themselves or post from post-traumatic trauma I guess um and the impact that that might have on on the women in their lives so there is that corollary there as well yeah I mean I i like to think that it's a it's the holistic approach it all have an opportunity or a you know I think a requirement to really take time to understand you know it's that don't don't judge until you've walked in their shoes and and that's not gender biased either you know that that is really about whatever experiences wherever that's happened and about helping everybody um you know to to make the most out of their lives and live their best life I guess yeah yeah yeah that's great thank you for that um so just moving on um looking more deeply at family and domestic violence the largest international study of its kind was recently published in the lancet journal and that was an international study that estimated that over a quarter of women aged 15 to 49 years has experienced physical and or sexual violence by a male partner in their lifetime it further um extrapolated that one in seven women globally had experienced domestic violence within the last year what do you think what more do you think needs to be done in order to reduce these numbers yeah and I know in australia we've still got one woman a week being murdered by an intimate partner uh you know I i think when I sort of sit back and think about it what we need is education and I would note that there's been some work over the weekend that's been announced around consent education which is a great step forward but it really is about it's about education and providing um you know our next generations with with the skills and the language to be able to sort of you know work through what needs to be worked through to stop the the continual um sort of you know the ongoing um you know violence that's occurring um at bayside women's shelter we work with a wonderful group of people through enlightened education and within the bayside lga they go into our schools they give our youth the language to explain um you know themselves to understand what what's going on and we talk all the time about respectful relationships and it's really powerful and this I think is the way going to say get in front perhaps not the right language but um this is the way that you know we can start breaking you know the the continual sort of you know ongoing cycle I guess um one of the things we do in the shelter is uh you know aside from our service delivery for our women and children it's really about the advocacy within our community so it's about um you know talking and and sharing the stories of you know our women and children and really enabling people to understand that this is not something that happens to someone else it doesn't necessarily happen you know suburbs and suburbs away this is happening right next door and we need to be able to understand how we can help and and how we can you know make an impact for our community um it's about I guess you know the education allows our you know the victims to be able to find a path to start talking about what they've what they've lived and and in that way I guess you sort of their new pathway and I guess the other thing that will always be on the agenda is we need more shelters we need you know we have um ongoing numbers of referrals when we're not full um and it's it you know it really is a sizable problem that needs to be dealt with and it needs to be dealt with well and quickly um so yeah I guess just allowing women to understand that there are um options for them and um and that comes from education I really believe that that's you know that's sort of the first step um you know providing that education piece so um you touched on um needing more more shelters so I guess this leads to my next question that issue of housing and security wouldn't be something that that is new to you um saying that family and domestic violence is the number one cause of homelessness in australia if you were prime minister of this country what would be the first thing that you would do to change this okay so the first sorry the primary you're allowed to make the changes aren't you allowed to do that of course so I think again the education piece on respectful relationships on um teaching our new generations um that are coming uh self-awareness um all of those elements of emotional um intelligence need to be built into the curriculum so that we're we're informing and um you know ensuring that our our future generations have got the language that they need in order to you know keep themselves safe and really sort of imagine the best world for them so that's the first one and the other one of course has to be an investment in mental health now it's not it's not my area of expertise by any stretch of the imagination but I know at every turn we face mental health challenges um and so we really need some some solid work on that and then just to go even further because remembering I am the prime minister after lunch I'm thinking we should probably work very very hard well very solidly on um you know I think that's going to take innovation I i you know I look to the cbd at the moment for example and we've got buildings that are empty there must be a way that we can reduce homelessness whilst we're working on mental health issues and I i hope that um all of the education in the previous piece works towards like an intergenerational attitude and behavioural change so yeah I think that's my first day down in dustin ronnie first day I think that's probably your first term thank you for that we might send a copy of the video to the prime minister um sally ann you're also on the board of netball new south wales one of the many board appointments that you have what do you hope to achieve in your time with with netball yeah thanks ronnie oh so first of all netball's a fabulous fabulous sport and everyone should be playing it um but I would take a step from that and say that team sport in itself has the capacity to you know to and community outcomes to those that are involved in team sport you know there's there's lessons that our children are learning on the court that they don't even realize they're learning at this point um you know it works improving mental health that it you know it creates some amazing community leaders and you know goes to building fitness and really is about inclusivity so there's some amazing outcomes from team sport and for me netball played since I was eight um you know is really about that so what I am most interested in um in my role on the board of netball new south wales is is driving participation at the grassroots at community sport level and of course we've had some like covert has delivered some really sort of major booms to that um but you know that that's my primary role um as well of course of all the other the roles that a you know board director has but my focus is really about you know building grassroots um level and you know ensuring that netball's a it needs ongoing and um you know to really benefit the community in the long run as well as a short term so yeah well that's very ambitious um and been with the sport for since you were eight yeah I'm not playing now a bit too old now um no I played netball as well when I was when I was younger I i also too old to play now um sally ann do you live locally in bayside I do I'm a sansuzi local for nearly 30 years fantastic and and can I ask you what what do you love about living in our community where are your favorite places to to chill out or find me time so me times an interesting question I quite nailed that really yet but um so it would be remiss of me if I didn't tell you that ramsgate rsl is a fabulous place to chill and to be um but if I go back to um your first point about you know sort of what do I love about living in the bayside area so my so it sort of runs through our blood I guess I love the beauty of the area I mean it's you know the the husband and I are known to be to walk along rocky point road up to captain cook bridge and then right round you know the front of the bay and it's an amazing amazing place and it's steeped in so much history it's you know it's it really is a beautiful place um and add to that we have an amazing community of people who are passionate they're engaging they're engaged and you know it's it there's nothing nicer than walking along the front of that bay and having people say hello and I think that's a really special thing um yeah so I guess me time is a different question I might have to to take that one on notice so yeah I mean I'm an animal lover and you know the bayside area is a beautiful place to to be able to walk dogs and that's special special for me fantastic well to speak with us today um and happy international women's day enjoy the rest of it thank you ronnie and thank you um to everyone and let's just make sure you remember we're breaking the bias that's what that's what today's about absolutely thank you very much you
Today is international women's day it is a pleasure to join you all on what is an important day today is a day when around the world we celebrate the social economic cultural and political achievements of women international women's day is a celebration of women and an opportunity to shine the spotlight on equality inclusivity and the achievements of the invaluable women in our community this year the theme is break the bias we are asked to imagine a gender equal world a world free of bias stereotypes and discrimination a world that is diverse equitable and inclusive that is a message not just for women but for everyone in our society and I say to all joining us today let's begin right here right now in bayside together we can break the bias and begin to make our little part of the world safer and more inclusive a world that celebrates and acknowledges differences together we can support each other and lift each other up to help break the bias imagine a gender equal world a world free of bias stereotype and discrimination a world is valued and celebrated together we can forge equality individually we are all responsible for our own thoughts and actions all day every day we can break the bias in our communities we can break the bias in our workplaces we can break the bias in our schools colleges and universities together we can all break the bias on international women's day and beyond whether deliberate or unconscious bias makes it difficult for women to move ahead knowing that bias exists isn't enough action is needed to level the playing field are you in will you actively call out gender bias discrimination and stereotyping each time you see it
 so so hello everyone my name is jo awada and I'm the mayor of bayside council I'm down here in brighton the sands at the location where a few weeks ago several beautiful trees were vandalized and destroyed sadly it wasn't the first time that trees at this location have been hacked down vandalism of any kind is not acceptable here at brighton sands we have taken the unusual stance and placed three shipping containers along the foreshore firstly to block out the view the vandals were hoping to achieve and secondly to give the newly planted trees some protection while they get established and grow shipping containers aren't very attractive and it is not fair that our magnificent for sure should be marred by the unsightly presence this is why council have engaged the services of a very talented young mural artist david craig david has transformed the containers into a colorful masterpiece that actually blends but also stands out the central focus of the wall is a yellowtail black cockatoo flocks of these guys can be seen cruising through the are one of the rarest species you'd see in the area these guys actually feed on the banksia nuts that we have depicted in the wall which sadly were cut down behind the shipping container so that's why we've got it nestled amongst a whole bunch of it make a bit of a statement about who we're affecting when we cut down these minute little tracks of urban canopy that we still have left over so this mural is much more than a work of art it serves not only as a reminder that trees were destroyed at this location but also that this act took away a food source for our native birds hefty fines apply and we will prosecute those responsible we are offering a reward for any information that results in a successful prosecution if you have information it will be confidential please contact council on 1300 581 20999 or the local police on 856 7499 we hope that our residents and visitors alike will enjoy this amazing piece of art over the next few years thank you you

meetings um as this is our first meeting of the planning and environment committee in our wonderful botany town hall items by exception given that there's six items on the agenda I'll give you uh the opportunity to deal with items by exception does anyone does anyone want to deal with any items by exception thank you we'll move on to item six public forum there are no speakers registered for public forum tonight so we'll move straight on to item 7 reports so first report is cpe22.001 draft planning proposal there's an officer's recommendation before us is there a mover and a seconder or does that mean I have to agree no by councillor werner seconded by councillor douglas uh is there any discussion um madam chair can I please ask for the council officer to give an overview of this report thank you councillor curry through the general manager would you like to assign an officer to speak to this item so through the chair we have the manager of strategic training here with us tonight claire harley I think they will be able to speak directly to the item um thank you through the chair the additional committed uses that were included previously included in the bodney bayelli we would no longer need those additional we no longer need those additional permitted users in the lep they relate to a site uh permissibility of residential flat buildings for sites where bonus provisions were applied under the the way the lep came about those uh the department of planning sought for us to remove them as part of the standardization of the lep that what didn't occur but they do need to be removed now because they and I suppose in some ways obsolete so additional permitted uses mean that in the schedule so to some extent this is uh administrative in that it will remove those controls from the lep and then the underlying controls stay in place so essentially the bonus provisions will be removed thank you can I through the chair I have um what consultation has taken place with those residents through the chair there was a period of time some years ago when there was more quite extensive consultation undertaken in relation to a series of properties um to which additional permitted uses the bonus provisions applied um that consultation was undertaken by the city of botany bay I believe and then this matter has always also been to the local planning panel at the end of last year it hasn't been on exhibition that would be the next step subject to council resolving to progress the draft planning proposal at which case we would then consult with the community more generally thank you counselor werner so these sites um so uh apu 34 and 35 are deleted um but then it also says that they will be amended on page three to provisions apply um yes I wasn't quite sure why they were deleted and then why they would be changed um through you madame general manager through you director um perhaps framing it in a little a slightly different way the on in the previous botany lep residential flat puttings were allowed in the r2 and r3 zones when council is looking at putting its new lap together um council wanted to take those users out of those zones so they were no longer submitted at the time the department of planning said they weren't prepared to do that until council had done its local housing strategy and made clear that they could provide that housing in another way in other zones so the lep went through with these two provisions in it um to preserve the right for resident to flat buildings to be in zones r2 and r3 in florida botany but the intention was always to come back after the local housing strategy was done and secretary taken out and that's what this lep is essentially about there were those six properties listed in and council had accepted previously that they could accommodate residential flights even though they were in those lower density zones um and the intention was always that that would be carried forward but those sites were still suitable so what's happening in this plan is that the potential for those 60s been preserved so they didn't need to be identified as being suitable for residential flight buildings in the current plan because they're committed in all r2 and r3 zones whereas in the future they won't be so that the right for these six to be developed residential platforms needs to be preserved if that's what council wants to carry forward um so those six sites also have an fsr bonus that applies only to those sites because that's previously been examined and found to be due to a good outcome so yeah in essence r2 and r3 will no longer be allowed for residential flight development apart from the six sites thank you director thank you is there any further discussion um yeah through you chair can can I ask um if is to inform the affected property owners when it goes out on exhibition please thank you councillor curry so if there's no further discussion I put that the recommendation motion on the screen moved by councillor werner and seconded by councillor douglas being moved with councillor curry's amendment which is that the council informed the affected property owners when the mata is on public exhibition all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against the motion say against I declare sorry I still don't really quite understand the details thank you councillor werner so I declare the motion carried so we move on to the next report which is cpe22.002 improvements to flood risk assessment and flood hazard mitigation in bayside lga resulting from increased rainfall and rising sea levels is there a mover in a second moved by councillor douglas seconded by councillor curry is there any discussion yeah again um through youtube can we ask for the appropriate office I'm not sure if these are these workings thank you um could we just ask for an overview of this report please to provide a explanation or summary of the report thank you um council is in the process of updating a number of flood studies in bayside as we do every now and then to make sure they're up to date with the most recent information as part of that process the consultant who's doing that work for us and doing the modeling has asked us what which parameters we'd like to include in terms of rainfall and also sea level rise due to climate change bayside doesn't have an adopted position on those matters in particular sea level rise and so this report is just really flagging a piece of work that we need to do to come back to council to have some directions set around which rainfall data we're going to incorporate there's a new new series of rainfall data out and also which um which targets for which primaries will set for sea level rise there's a number of scenarios that council could adopt in terms of the level of climate change that we expect and they affect the sea flood studies that we're doing so this is a new piece of work and I guess we're just um bringing to council's attention that it's something we'd like to do um there is funding available for through the stormwater libya um so if council is happy for us to go ahead with that that report will be completed and then brought back to council for a decision on those particular matters thank you director thank you so can I just clarify in relation to um when we're considering obviously we've had um it's been a hard time across many areas of the state at the moment and I know we've done numerous flood studies over recent years and in relation to you know in response to the events so I guess to what extent do where we record our hot spots and then to what extent are those hot spots then incorporated into identified I guess and then incorporated into how we're going to address these areas and what the plan is in order to achieve that the models are things as inputs so historical flood data is one thing that is used in the models um uh it's also around topography a mapping of the drainage system and then rainfall data and all sorts of things as well there's assumptions about the percentage of pipes that blocked a whole lot of things that are built into it so yes real life data in terms of where flooding occurs is definitely fed into those considerations so the process is generally the flood study is done which identifies areas that are a problem there's then a risk analysis done to see which areas are the worst in terms of depth and speed of water and things like that and then the third step is to look at mitigation options so that's where we look at ways that we can help reduce the impacts and then they're basically modeled on a cost-benefit basis some of them are very expensive and they deliver a lot of benefit so we look for the ones that will deliver good value for money and they're the ones that then get general process thank you thank you um through the chair so if if we can considering so obviously if I just refer to the next committee which the agenda item is on stormwater drainage across the lga so if if we're looking at a strategic approach to targeting those hot spots that we've seen time and time again is that at where does a plan sit um in relation is it best placed in under consideration as part of this recommendation or is it best placed in the other committee report through your director yes uh chair um the other matter would be a better one this one's really just focusing on rainfall data and central rise the other committee committee's looking at a report that's more important than that okay thank you thank you thank you um through the chair um I've been um sent some information from someone from the insurance industry and they are claiming that the um even the ipcc data is not really properly up to date and um or you know it doesn't really show the the it's a political organization it's a government organization some sometimes uh the um according to this person uh the um you know we could we could be using better uh or data that's that's more in line with for instance what the insurance industry uses so um you know I i don't know how how accurate this uh particular information is but what I would like to know is if the insurance industry uses um a scenario that's uh has less risk or that that protects us better would it be possible to use that data instead of this um uh that's the one that's recommended in in the business papers which I believe is um assuming um 40 centimeters increase by 2050 because I think the insurance industry is saying that it's actually going to be more so would that be impossible uh through your chair um part of this work will be to look at what what the best starter is then we'll come back to council with some information on that um what generally there's a in temperature you pick that that then has impacts in terms of the sea level rise and other things intensity of rainfall frequency of storms all those sorts of things so there's a scenario from kind of best case to worst case and so um and they're supported by different data so we'll come back with those and then um you know the challenge for counsellors to pick where they where they want to place themselves on that on that spectrum from worst case the best case and use that as inputs into our model so yeah we'll we'll look at what data's around and report that back thank you thank you councillor I think it'll be an amendment or it might be just a suggestion that this doesn't come back to a committee it goes straight to a gm briefing because it's always the time if we have another report and it's got a it's so detailed we need a gm briefing so I'm saying if you're either just a suggestion or you can make it goes directly to jm briefing because I didn't realize if we move something tonight to go to a genuine briefing we can't do anything until it's ratified at council at the end of the month so it would delay of all that time so maybe make it part one or a suggestion that it goes to once the report's finished it has to go to a june briefing instead of coming here and then wait and it's time because I think it's fairly important um after what's been going on the last two weeks so I'll suggest that either you have this part like two that the report goes directly to a junior briefing thank you councillor barlow that does that sound like a amendment to the motion yes it is the councillors that have moved the nation may want to take that on board or they thought council of barlow will need a secretary for the amendment um um what the impact of climate change actually will be locally and I think this report is an opportunity for us to really as a community to build resilience and also adaptation but also looking at what measures we can do as a council to uh to also mitigate our own carbon emissions so I think I'm in support of the amendment because I think this is a very important opportunity for councillors to bend down that knowledge about climate change is there any further discus counselor wena can I just ask when you're saying um deferred to or um that we talk about it at a gm briefing do you mean the one that's in a couple of weeks time but you cannot refer this on until it's been ratified by council even though it's tonight it's a committee meeting it has to be then go to a full council meeting so by the time they do the report I'm just saying when the report is finalized don't bring it here and then send it somewhere else send it straight to a jam briefing because it's too important just to come here with everyone trying to read it and understand it when you come thank you need to be done and that more than two weeks anyway so that's correct come to the generation once that's correct so is there any further debate on the amendment so can I all those there being no further discussion I put the amendment on the screen moved by councillor councillor barlow and councillor douglas all those in favor say aye all those against say against I declare the motion carried thank you madam general manager through the chair um the additional words that were added to the original motion can be treated as one draft motion it's not one or the other it's actually the officers prepare the report the report then goes to an information session once it has been constructed before coming back to a further committee meeting that's actually what would happen normally would be that the original movers would be asked whether they'd accept councillor barlow's additional words and then you're just voting you're not voting one or the other you're voting on it in its totality which I think sort thank you for the clarification madam no thank you for the clarification um appreciate that so is there any further discussion on the additional wording to the motion there being no further discussion I put the recommendation motion on the screen moved by councillors douglas and curry all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against the motion say against I declare the motion carried so moving on to the next item which is cpe2 draft local heritage grant policy is sarah mover anna seconder councillor musket so moved by councillor barlow seconded by councillor musket is there any discussion can I just ask the question please through the chair um so just to be clear the grants are to be paid in retrospect after the work has already been done rather than beforehand that's great and is that because we need to ensure that the work has been done to a heritage standard thank you councillor douglas I believe the application indicated that you need to provide proof of receipts and expenditure so I assumed it was in retrospect thank you um is there any policy going on exhibition so is there any um discussion I mean I'm just gonna say it seems like quite a small amount of money for a whole large through you um madam general manager uh through the chair um a couple of reasons yes this is reinventing the policy that previously existed the amount is consistent with a former resolution of the council that's probably about 18 months old that we put approximately 30 000 aside per annum it's also consistent with what neighbouring council of councils are funding at the moment so I think it's really a matter of let's see how this goes how it works in reality what the take up is what the result is in improving streetscape and you know the look and feel of the area and then council will have the opportunity to review it in the future if you wish to thank you can I just ask what sort of previous uptake there has been for the grants program it's a long time ago I know in other councils this is this is about what to do quite a lot of promotion but also set expectations that it's a small contribution because it is about improving private property so it's a small contribution to just encourage and support people who have heritage items thank you just through the chair just for the purposes of people listening so it's purely for the facade of properties that is street facing yes so that you can actually see that difference when funding is used thank you is there any other discussion would the mover like to exercise her right of reply may also vary the maximum amount that can be applied for that to me is becomes a political football I think it should be maximum of 3 000 because that gives 10 people a chance otherwise it could come out our life you know it would help you get 5 000. so I'd prefer it to be setting concrete because otherwise it could be but I think when it started many many years ago it was a thousand dollars madam general manager um the just to explain the context of those words in how much the total pool of funds are not the individual grant itself so yeah it's just the budgetary process thank you is there any further discussion by councillors barlow and musket all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against the motion say against I declare the motion carried on to item cpe22.004 draft submission design and place state environmental planning policy is there a mover and a seconder moved by councillor curry seconded by councillor werner I have a mover and a seconder for the recommendation is there any discussion I believe there is councillor douglas um objective one which is on pages specifically states not to have electric recharging stations in through the director can you what was that page number again council objectives uh through the chair um the reference where it says talks about electric vehicle charging statements in the public realm I think that's really making reference to public open space and so that might be uh cook's park say that where we would prefer for electric vehicle parking stations to be would be in say areas that further alienation of usable open space so whether they be public or private car parking spaces um that that would be the more appropriate place otherwise we could see a situation where we are alienating um grassed areas that are used for recreational facilities one thing that I suggested was that we could have stations there so that would be invisible well um yes I suppose it's really that we're trying to protect the open space but car parking public parking places may be appropriate subject to further council consideration I have one other question thank you councillor objective it says to avoid conflicts with cycle ways to manage conflicts by sending psychology managing conflicts by sending some results away parallel to public transport routes and it's above that sorry the cycle network should be prioritizing secondary streets not main streets or streets with bus zones as a cyclist myself who relies on a bike to get around um I have to go to main street to do my business I can't always be in so I i don't understand why you'd be pushing also helps to minimize even car traffic going into the shopping area and therefore the less need for the parking we need to be uh encouraging active transport rather than pushing into back streets in my mind here's a question thank you um councillor douglas um miss healy do you have a response harley sorry for that uh yes through the chair um the comment really in there is I suppose that level where you're starting to do place making and it's it's obviously place by place the comment would be around trying to minimise conflict so we have some areas in our lga where we have black spots where cyclists are coming into conflict with heavy trucks we do have a lot of heavy trucks um the so we would like to make sure that that's managed well so we have um working with the transport for new south wales and they have a movement place and movement uh hierarchy and that's what we tend we will be working with so this comment probably is talking um I don't think it probably so it's talking about creating places in some places in this lga that conflict we can't necessarily keep those cyclists on the same route as some of our very very heavy traffic because it's not really appropriate and I think that's if you've got a very strong residential environment and potentially a neighborhood center or a local centre then you obviously have the cyclists working in with the pedestrians but we have to manage conflict and so that comment really I think is around that sort of management it's place based so could I make a suggestion through the chair that maybe there'd be some clarification around what main streets is that it's not high streets my understanding of a high street is a shopping village whereas a main street could be mistaken for that yep we'll take that on notice and make the amendment thank you thank you douglas as the member of the motion um to clarify that we're not talking about high streets when we're talking about objective set seven in terms of pushing the technology chair um I was wondering if we could um also compare how this um compares to other uh councils because um I know that when when I used to ride to uni I used to ride through the city of sydney I think and it's burke street I believe it's one of those big streets it does have a cycle way and it's quite convenient because it goes um you know it's a long street and so you know it uh it's very convenient to use um as a cyclist but there are a lot of trucks as well because it's in alexandria so perhaps if we can just compare with other councils so that we don't sort of um limit the places where we could possibly put cycleways thank you councillor I believe this is a submission um to a to the state environmental planning policy coming from bayside so I'm not sure I'll take it take it from staff to answer whether it's appropriate to do a comparison for a submission um can staff please answer uh chair policy so I guess we're just conveying based on its comments on that other councils I guess I'll do the same thank you yeah through chair I have to agree with credits um councilwoman sorry a comment I use that type of way often myself and it is running through an industrial area that the cycleway is separated very safely and it's a fantastic route you can get right into the city within 20 minutes it's faster than driving in fact so I i don't actually have a problem with riding alongside trucks if there is a safe delineation thank you councillor douglas I i do believe for the purposes of this submission this is a bayside opinion on a state policy we're not um developing bayside policy yet um so thank you for those comments I know I i understand that uh but I do think that we are making submission about what we are representing and I i do think that we do need to represent the diversity of those experiences in what we're pushing forward can I ask um miss something sorry um madam general thank you just reading objective seven I don't think that what um the staff have constructed and what's being said tonight are in conflict I think where we're where councillors are describing a very safe separation of cycle way from other vehicles we could include that in here what we're really talking about is generally where we can't achieve that because of the width of our roads because they're state roads and we're not able to do that so I would suggest that perhaps we would resolve the issue if we said where full and safe separation cannot be achieved the cycle weighing in work should be prioritized in secondary streets and that way we've covered everybody thank you comfortable with that thank you so courage are you as the mover of the motion are you happy to accept those additional words is there any further discussion so there being no further discussion I put the recommendation on the screen moved by councillors curry and werner all those in favor of the motion say aye all those onto item cpe22.005 submission to employment zones reform is there a mover and a seconder moved by councillor douglas seconded by councillor barlow is there any discussion yeah through the chair can can I ask for a summary from the appropriate council officer please thank you councillor curry um can I ask for a officer summary um through the chairs so the state government has embarked on quite a significant range of planning reforms and this is one looked at the employment zones in the standard instrument which is what the it is called the the base I suppose planning controls that the state government had created so council's bayside's local environmental plan is based on the standard instrument the state government has the capacity to go and make changes to that standard instrument that automatically can change laps across the state they can also take into account council submissions about their own local environmental plan so what they've done in this instance is undertaken to do reform of employment zones in the standard instrument so they've got an agenda to try and improve how employment it's all the activities that happen in those zones so business related activities um all of those sort of industrial and business zones going into employment zones what they did was for each council they did a draft translation so they took our existing lep local environmental plan and said under our new reforms we propose to go to this so what this submission is doing is really saying we've looked out to the department planning we've looked at what you've proposed for us and we think this is okay and that is is we're not comfortable with that so it's quite technical um there's quite a bit of technical detail in there there'll be some uses where the rockdale and the l former rockdale and former um botany leps didn't_''_2563.04 say the same thing and we've tried to work out what is the best way forward to promote employment to promote business activity but not impact the amenity of the businesses or the people who live in the area and the environment so that's overall I suppose what uh councillor curry thank you chair um through the chair so um so what would be the main points where um you know on what has been changed and then so that the committee can understand and what those potential impacts are on the areas where that is actually occurring um I suppose the you know some areas you've got um changes where uh they're looking at well there's that one of the main things is they're changing the name of the zones um they're collapsing some of the um I suppose the uses in there so you're seeing some changes in the b1 and the b2 zones what are currently that and they're becoming a one zone so at the moment you might have areas where we've got b1 which is a neighborhood center and we've also got b2 which is a slightly bigger center and they're turning that into one local center now in some areas in new south wales and and bayside included that very small zone the b1 was applied to the smallest the smallest centres the impacts and the amenity impacts on the surrounding land users so they've collapsed that into one and we've had to make some judgment calls on what's that actually mean around amenity um what what we think is an appropriate scale for that broader area so to some extent they've taken away some of that nuance that you might have seen with having more zones thank you any further discussions just a question um we've got a timeline I think of april is there any chance this is fairly important because they're just pushing away what industrial land would have um are we losing any of the industrial land like are we yeah um thank you miss harley um so through the chair now this doesn't actually this isn't proposing to re-zone any of the industrial land so no it's it's a translation of the it's looking at the actual wording in the local environmental plan and what zones we would then have moving forward industrial land is not being resigned as part of this and in fact the a detailed report and it's very hard to really understand but if you had time it should go to another gm briefing because it's a very important document thank you councillor barlow so do any of these changes disadvantaged current zonings um I mean jeff I could our intention through this is really to try and maintain the status quo as best we can we weren't looking to to make any policy changes or significant shifts in what people can and can't_''_2779.92 do as as we said the zones are being collapsed into a smaller number so there is some fine grain that's lost in there so there is a slight broadening I would say in some zones of the things that you can do now there's nothing radically different and we've tried this report talks about additional permitted uses as well as one of the early reports did so we tried to use that mechanism to carry forward as best we can exactly what's in our current lep um so to try and bring back some of that fine grain by you can and can't_''_2815.28 do certain things even though in the broader zone changes they're saying that you can so um we're not sure that the pump will accept all of those because they are trying to broaden things out and simplify them but um our position really has been to just try and maintain the status quo as best we can with some of the changes in definitions and that sort of thing there is a slight you know there is some slight broadening in some areas of what you can do in some zones thank you director councillor now thank you through the chair um so I take this as a submission to the employment zones reform that the state government is doing so is there anything in the state government that the state government wants to do that we're arguing for or against in this um submission or we're basically just saying we want a more fine-grained uh categorization of the employment lands through your chair there's a couple of different uh elements to the state government's lands reform work terms of how much of it we need in certain parts of the city where there's a chance for it to be given over to other uses or changed in some way that's not this project that's a separate one which will probably come back to you with some states in the future um so that is council valor saying that is a project where they might look at saying certain areas can be turned over to residential or some other use this one is just contained really to a consolidation of the number of zones that we have and the translation of our current lep into the new framework and our objective used to for there to be as little change as possible through that but um you're right there are there are other parts of reform going on but they're not at this stage yet thank you councillor curry thanks through the chair um so as as a submission so in the way that the state government is getting a number of submissions um so at what point is their community consultation on chair this this is effectively a planning proposal like other ones the council sees um but it's been run by the state government across the whole of the state um so they are proposing so they're working with individual councils because everyone's lep's a little bit different to get this translation piece done and then they propose to actually put the whole thing on exhibition across the whole state at once and the department of planning are going to run that as the as the authority who's proposing this change I understand they're going to work with us in terms of how that's done locally where the information is available and things like that but it is being led by the public claim thank you thank you through the chair so when that comes back as a final submission does that then come to back to council um through the chat that's my understanding but I can take that or not just to confirm that yeah that would be good um that when it goes out on public exhibition through the new they have an option an opportunity to provide that feedback thank you councilman do we need to do this do we need to add that into thank you councillor curry thank you councillor douglas would you like to um sorry is there any further discussion on on this councillors mcdougall and as soon as you can also contribute if you have a question so councillor douglas would you like to exercise your right of reply as the move of the motion um I'm going to say that I do agree with council valor that some of these materials are very in-depth and I do is that if we have more time they would be great to bring to a gym briefing but I do understand there is a lot of time limits on some of these materials given therefore to account for late december and we haven't had that opportunity is difficult to um fully understood yes thank you councillor douglas I believe some of these um submissions would have um state government implied timelines so there hasn't been an opportunity for us to receive those briefings on the screen moved by councillor douglas and barlow with the addition of number two that council notifies the public once the department of planning and environment places the matter on exhibition all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against the motion say against I declare the motion carried now on to our last item under reports cpe22.006 submission to new south wales department of planning and environment discussion paper a new approach to rezonings do I have a mover and a secondary moved by councillor werner seconded by councillor musket is there any discussion again through the chair could I ask for a summary through the chair so this is another one of the state government's reform packages the state government is looking to improve the processing times I suppose for planning proposals planning proposals are essentially rezonings changes to the planning controls under the local environmental plan so our principal planning controls and planning proposal um times are quite significant because of the amount of work that we have to put into assessing them so we have to assess whether they have site a bit of time so there's been concerns uh in various quarters that councils take too long to do that this reforms really talking about reducing that time by streamlining the process so that councils move quicker essentially one of the key things that we've note found in this review is that the um a planning proposal would be placed on public exhibition without council considering that planning proposal it would also be placed on exhibition without staff having prepared a report to accompany it so essentially it would rely on I suppose the information that was provided by the proponent but they would do that in consultation with council officers the planning proposal would be prepared that way so that would be a potentially a significant change because at the moment planning proposals do go to council before they go on exhibition um and I think in dot point on on one of the summary pages there you'll see that uh we're not the department of planning is not proposing any more additional resourcing for councils uh we think that there would be an impulse be more spot rezonings coming about as a result of this change rather than there being a strong reliance on the strategic planning framework the council's put in place with its local strategic planning statement its local environmental plan and its development control plan the one of the other key considerations is the proposal is for well the discussion paper talks about an appeals mechanism for planning proposals that might go to the land and environment court at the moment there is no such appeal in the land and environment court and the submission the draft submission does raise concerns around land and environment corp making decisions around changes potentially to councils local environmental plan that it has essentially adopted publicly exhibited and and approved for gazetto um so I suppose they're some of the key things that that we've raised um and I know that there's been uh you know we've we've talked to our counterparts across um the local area the this eastern city district in particular to identify uh concerns that they have and I think our submission is aligned the chair so what the new south wales department of planning and environment are proposing is to take decision making away from councils and override the opportunity for councils to have a say on planning proposals is that is that correct through the chair I think not entirely taking that away but deferring assessment of a planning proposal before it goes on public exhibition so the the council would still have a role to play in the planning proposal but the assessment would not happen um early on as early on as it does now it would happen after exhibition so the current process is that a planning proposal will come to council and council will determine whether that claiming proposal then goes on to the government and count the elected council can choose to reject or accept that planning proposal correct yes so in actual fact what the department are trying to do is take away that opportunity from elected council to have a say in their area around what may or may not be a suitable planning proposal and that is atrocious again this is just another example's really not acceptable and my question is does our submission and in its detail is it strong enough to put forward that through the chair that look uh council staff have uh adopted an objective uh tone in the draft submission and we've done an analysis of I think of of the current situation and considered what is being proposed um the tone of that submission I'll leave that up to the elected representative to decide whether or not that's appropriate thank you thank you through the chat so then I might wait in case other counselling questions are there any other questions from councillors council barlow no matter me is doing a good job thank you I am assuming that all councils have got the same attitude you're fighting a battle of the world without so I'm hoping that you know if there's enough submissions from all councils possibly we've got to go to the local members as well um because they need to know even though they're in opposition they all need to know what's happening thank you there are quite a lot of um changes coming from the state government um councillor curry so can I suggest if I can ask the movers um council werner and musket if we make an amendment there and that we had councillor barlow's suggestion there of um yeah writing to all the local members in relation to um that we strongly um disagree with the proposal from uh the the new south house department and planning and environment and additionally that you know if the committee is open that the committee um makes point that um we also so even though this is a submission isn't also an opportunity to write to the planning minister so that we write to the planning minister and again which I think we've done in the past reiterating our total disgust at a proposal like this and taking away the decision-making of whether something is appropriate or inappropriate for a particular local government area where councillors themselves are familiar with the area and understand the impacts where someone looking at a plan in the department of education has no understanding regardless so and I i also think um we can this general manager can I hear a response um uh uh through the chair I was also just wondering whether councillors might like to move that this be raised by your delegates to ss rock tomorrow night and that ss rock also very strongly object representing so many councils with such vehement views about the inappropriateness of these changes that we might ask our councillors who are there to raise it and to get the support of the whole lot thank you so council awana are you exercising your rite of reply um I think uh this is a fantastic suggestion so I completely agree with that I was just wondering who's going to ss because I know that it's clashing with the um I know this is slightly off topic but thank you councillor werner do you have anything to add to um to your discussion council werner as the mover of councillor curry sorry sorry can I sorry interrupt you for your final so through the chair to the gm uh do you think there's anything relation to our strong views against what the what's being proposed um but through the chair at one point we did think as as a group of councils the eastern seaboard councils there were going to be a series of mayoral minutes put up so that it could really be given a lot of oxygen at a council meeting there was a suggestion that we do that with the more I guess political language that you can use that you're free to use at a council meeting as opposed to what a staff submission looks like so we might include that as well thank yeah thank manager I think that's a good suggestion and we'll I'll put forward a mayoral minute and for the next council meeting I just want to ask questions we've still got time because it's going to be a month overdue is and can I just say that even though the submission is due at that time the campaigning doesn't have to stop at that date the solution thank you councillor barlow and thank you madam general manager reply um no I i agree so no further discussion on this uh on this motion so um there being no further discussion I put the recommendation with the additions that are on the screen moved by councillors werner and musket all those in favor of the motion say aye all those against the motion say against um so there being no further items I declare the meeting closed sorry counselor questions unfortunately not in the committee no not in the committee unfortunately so there being no further items I declare this meeting closed at 7 37 pm I declare the meeting of the city works and assets committee meeting open at 7 47 pm um I don't think we have any speakers tonight everyone at the meeting is reminded to conduct themselves in a polite and professional manner and observe the code of meeting practice do we have any disclosures of interest so I'd also remind you the video recording is an official record of council and may be made available to persons upon request in accordance with the government information public access act 2009 no other country bayside council represent respects the traditional custodians for land their elders past president emerging on which this meeting takes place and we acknowledge the chedical and digital clans of the sydney basin um I believe we have one apology tonight uh councillor fardel in a second of the apologies sorry do we have now any disclosures of interest of interest you have no uh minutes of the previous meeting move on to our only report for the night item cwa 22.001 stormwater drainage across the bayside lga we have a mover and a second one with councillor curry secondary council jansen we have any discussion um through you chair could we please um ask for just a summary from the appropriate council officer meeting in relation to three main areas which are interested in relation to stormwater drains across the bayside lga a previous report had been furnished back on the 29th of june 2021 to gm briefing session outlining council's responsibilities and roles so I'd like to just run through the main points of the report if that's okay so for a bit of stormwater management and custodianship council's eight catchment areas the flood studies and flood plains the council has the proactive maintenance schedules being mechanical and manual sweeping and the creeks and drains crews and their roles including gross political chaps operations hotspot uh flood maps recent stormwater upgrades which has been to the value of six million dollars planned stormwater upgrades which are upcoming there was a conclusion and um closing statement the main findings within the report in the conclusion was um that the streets we've been programmed that we have at the moment in the stormwater management for the maintenance is working very well the custodian ship you know was shared between council sydney water transport new south wales um the australian rail track corporation uh sackled um some of the independent data that we've got from bureau of meteorology also explains that even though we have uh increased developments the severity of the flooding within the yield gender frequency is about the same nothing's really changed most of the bayside lga is title um inundated which affects by stormwater surges and um that the of the land so all in all the uh the main points were that you know it's fairly complex all the ownership and the the people that are involved in the process not only do they have their own maintenance regimes with all these other organizations they also have third third-party relationships so the changing environment with policy state legislation also makes it slightly difficult but all in all from what we've just experienced in last week which has been sort of the most inundated rainfall that we've had on record by side fed uh really well in that process in addition I have the council's manager city works with me who's a bit of a subject matter expert in it and manager of city infrastructure jeremy morgan to answer any further detailed questions any further questions could I ask a few uh another questions mr chair so through you um to the director what's sydney water sydney waters obligation uh in relation to the stormwater network that we have in place that's my first question uh their obligations are to maintain their in the council stormwater asset area so some of our pipes will flow into theirs their flow will run into ours their flow will run into basins that they have to maintain and look after we have no jurisdiction over how they maintain or how they look after their assets but they're similar to us that they want everything to be free flowing and working well and working as it should be because you mentioned the through the check you mentioned gross pollutant traps that lead into the larger channels for one of the better work yet it's in their channel it's in their jurisdiction is that is that right or am I a little bit off the page who does what it's not very clear yeah it can be both but the majority of our gpts are within our asset network is that correct jeremy yes um for us to maintain and we may obligation lands back on us I guess okay another question I had is a stormwater living is collected by sydney water on our on our water rates each year do we no remuneration so that maintains their asset pretty much that's correct and there are charges okay and now our our assets go into their assets so to speak okay or vice versa yes yes so it's a complex network between all those assets yeah because I've got to say it's like from what I see on just observation okay we've had wet weather we've had a fairly long dry spell as well before there was a lot of leaf foliage and the council has done a fantastic job in sending the machine around to to collect the foliage that comes off the trees onto the roadway because that builds up it's a shame there's a lot of cars that hardly move during the day when our teams are out there because you obviously can't sweep underneath the cars but I've seen the teams go out there with blowers and and do the best they can to move that with that constant that constant foliage um off the street and that and that impacts on the stormwater runoff at the end and so on yeah it's look it's predominantly hubcaps and metals and things that block up our stormwater network you know enhance your grass clippings and leaf off your driveway it'll just come straight off yeah and that just travels through but yeah our gpt's ending we try and collect as much as we can through mechanical means the manual means um through the gpt's we'll collect a lot of our plastics and different bits and pieces so that's fiber there's a fair bit of human pollution that goes down river constantly constantly despite our warnings and our requests to the community thank you mr chairman just um on the back of what council was asking in relation to the responsibility where they are state roads or waterboard assets what is council's approach in ensuring their accountability for maintaining those assets I might just pass over to mr spelter to answer that question um in relation to transport for new south wales assets specifically um we don't have a say in their maintenance regime we have a we ring their any flooding or anything and we have contacts with sydney connect there's the new uh maintenance uh stewardship council there and they've asked us specifically just to use the tread the transport management center to report things through to them thank you through the chair so they do not have a maintenance schedule that has been provided is that correct that's great so just um I guess to the committee then would that not be an appropriate request particularly when there's a number of issues that we've been having where we know that drains are not maintained on a regular basis where we've got key flooding on a regular basis that's probably worth adding to the motion through the chair they are probably um infrastructure issues for instance there's a massive one there was a massive one during this recent rain period on the grand parade at monterrey and as soon as it rains more than 10 mil it fuels and people and four-wheel drives get through and I would assume some people would have reported that but it's a constant budget for it or it will send you or because there's no budget for it so is it something that we can go into sydney water or transport from new south wales and say look there's a constant problem we can identify a handful of places where it constantly floats thinking about the the bottom of dexley road near uh kingsworld road because that'll never get fixed it's probably last point in the world there but there's other areas where we can pinpoint say look without rain incidents it doesn't need to be as bad as what we had this this week but there are incidents when there's less rain and it keeps on flooding in that in that specific zone another one is the prince's highway just opposite the uh that warlock creek doesn't need to park there that floods fairly fairly often as well with a bit of rain dissipates quickly but for that half hour when it does rain heavily it is a burden of drivers yeah through the chair I think um you know we certainly seen couple of weeks and um yeah very somewhere across the state it's been awful and um and I guess for us speaking from a bayside context we've had a number of flood studies done over recent years and I guess several flooding events as well and so in order for us to address these areas um I think it's really important we apply a long-term strategy so looking at as you mentioned council soon as those hot spots and then coming up with a strategy that then um resolves to to work towards mitigating those issues so if the the committee is open I'd like to propose that for the next city works and assets committee meeting that um we council officers re-table the flood studies with a summary for the lga so that we can um specifically see where those hot spots are and providing a list of all known flooding hot spots across the lga including new areas that may have been impacted recently and then provide a list of the top flooding hotspots and plans for long-term mitigation of these areas including funding that can be managed through good drain let's it's important that the top ones are determined and that there is a strategy in place otherwise um it just could be a targeted approach to avoid those major issues that have a huge impact on our community you know and their property I'd suggest that being incorporated into the motion council jansen can I just ask what the what the scope of the thank you the role of the committee is really to oversee the I guess the the process of understanding flood behaviour in the in the bayside health and data through conducting flood studies flight risk management studies which identify options for treatments or for property modifications and zoning controls right through to assessing the options and the feasibility and the benefit cost ratio of the different options so they uh have oversized the whole whole process state government departments have an interest in in water management in new south wales so it's quite a diverse group um it's quite a specialised group that's focused on flood behaviour through chairs so does the mitigation um options that go into the flood risk management plans and can they yes so to answer the committee is integral with looking at the options so this is the nature of this work um the options are put forward to the committee to review once the assessment's been undertaken and see what those benefit costs ratios are looking at what essentially what they will do is look at what the reduction in flood levels are so the number of properties that may no longer be affected by flooding if we're a team on a particular trip that's mitigation just have one more question through your chat how how does the council's flood risk management plan intersect with the coastal management plan that was mentioned in a report of the previous committee I note that so through chad the two processes are related but they are somewhat independent as well so in terms of the issues that they're looking at flood behavior across bayside isn't um so they are quite independent from that regard there are similar um sea level rise impacts and to have consistency in the way both of those it's a very good report and it was a really good gm briefing when it was 20 whatever it was but there is a list there and I actually like the fact that this is what we do so there's a lot of knowledge there you can pass on to the community when they have a whinge can I um we've just seen a massive planning event and the prediction over the last few weeks and I know that like a resident has written to me who said that since she moved into the area it's been progressively getting worse um since 2011 it's flooded in 2012 2015 2018 2020 tried twice three times in 2021 in her area so I just wonder is there an opportunity for us to capture some information from the community about who's been impacted over the last few weeks because to update this report because the impacts and an indication of where things might be going in the future given that we're facing climate change look and I'm I'm happy um to put an additional point in there that um you know that we have a have your say on um where council where residents can um yeah can put in um you know a photo with an area that is not a one-off but just so that we have a um the data then the committee is happy with that we've got to be clear also to the community that a lot of residences and if not all are built in a certain way especially newer houses they're built to to meet and probably exceed basics requirements their drones are built in a certain way they're designed for a certain quantum now people might say well my backyard's flooding and it's disappeared in half hour that's a big difference between what's happened up north with some of the country towns up there where we're talking meters here if it's only localized flooding and flooding through their property because what I can understand is those ten flooding hot spots are generally infrastructure areas known as roads can over the edge of the bank and sort of 10 meters in there was water there okay I can get that but was there any where personal property was all that came from a public waterway not as far as where are we yeah because I didn't hear anything because you'd hear it on the grapevine so to speak but if there's issues of I know for a fact I used to work once near the um it was that canelo I don't know what it's called that I went into the first time to work and they had their computer sitting on milk crates and I didn't know why and then he said to north florence here every few months and we need to keep the company out of the water so that's something where they've built their knowing that there is the potential to flood down the track so all the residential houses wouldn't be in that zone that wouldn't be have that impact but again I'm asking the question because I don't know the answer and I arranged for her to be in contact with she has said that she is about to go door to door and put an action group together to lobby council to do action on that site to help that's what the science is telling us well we're not here to discuss what may happen in the future we're here to discuss what we've seen in front of us and what's immediate and then down the track we can start looking at other things I think uh mitigation measures are about dealing with the future that's a lot inherently yeah but there are things in our face there are certain things that haven't occurred no one I haven't heard of anyone have their personal property flooded out apart from this particular lady and we've got a lot of residents in the area with all judicious debt councils I don't think anybody expected the floods in lismore to be as extreme as they have been either so we are facing but without being rude the floods went to a certain level their last event so our job there's a big difference between a hundred million ten meters council as soon as I believe there was at least one property in botany road on botany where flood waters did enter the I don't know the property but can I through your chair can I ask if there is is there a um risk rating done against the the level of flood um as councillor soon has said that bayside lga residents haven't faced the same kind of circumstances as residents in lismore or other areas so how is the kind of the level of damage or risk rated with floods is that kind of work documented the bayside the club pay management committee bayside is prone to susceptible to flooding throughout our area long areas it's not about all local government areas but I think the state that's already been passed is we have all of our modeling and if we can look at those areas pick out the top five or so in each of the catchment areas have a look at them see what plans or what the council was correct and I did forget about that sandbagging of the adjacent fence there might have been a couple of garages I saw a couple of them in there one of our neighboring lgas where they were pumping out low-lying garages under multi-unit drillings where the pumps have either stopped seasonal couldn't cope with the capacity was coming down but all in all I think that there was only two other areas that we delivered some sandbags and from the ses point of view sources because we've already got cleanup out there at the moment more is coming out it's heavier people may be taking a little bit of advantage of that at the same time but we're well behind with the amount of rain that we've had in all of our operational areas no matter what it is knowing that the cleanup area is very difficult and we've got a few more issues with a lot of the tip sites at the moment transfer station issues in regards to waste which I'll be speaking with the general manager our residents through your chair is is there an opportunity as part of identifying the top 10 flooding hot spots to provide potentially street signage indicating that it is a flood zone what are your thoughts my understanding is that the flood warning signage is typically instigated through the ses because there are some issues around sign posts in those particular the flood hazard markets so we'd have to have a discussion with them about locations that may be suitable and they're typically on state can't counsel it curry can I just add um through the chair so um to the committee so in the past um where there's been there was a particular flood zone council had erected a sign which which just said you know please be aware that this area is subject to flooding and so it's just a it's just an alert to make people conscious of where they park them in the rain so I think um to councillor johnson's point that's something when the next report comes to council we can potentially um once the hot to then look at opportunities for so much because I'm aware of that type of signage on chelmsford avenue in botany and there's a few uh there's a few spots there and I don't believe they they were instigated by the ses but it's just as in response to um residents contacting me and saying people are still parking their cars there and are still driving through flood waters even though the ses message is strong and indicates not to drive through residents or people our communities still do this so how do you fix that you put up and we're going to update this report with the issues in this recent incident but is there an opportunity for us to use the report that we discussed at the last committee tonight which is about researching to the blood-planning risks moving forward in the face of climate change to also flag to incorporate that knowledge into this report so that this report does have does look to the future and looks to prevention uh and take so that we can take on our responsibility managing to do I'm unaware of the previous report spoken about the previous meeting but I'm sure that will be incorporated into all councils for client management studies now we're moving forward I might just off the back of that so I don't think that's a good summary of all the um you know we've got these one two eight um blood plain risk management studies we've done over the last 20 years or so I understand a number of those are currently being updated but something that's come to light I think in the recent round of floods and obviously this is a catastrophic event it's not you know we're not experiencing what they are in lismore here but we obviously have to prepare for prepare for these sort of things and it's really highlighted that but I was going through the last floodplain risk management study we did and again something that's come to light during this is that a lot more planning and studying is being done the natural mitigation that's certainly been an at this there are a couple of recommendations for mitigation measures I've just been interested to say have we taken any action on those um so for the officers just looking through this it's recommended by the in the report this is I think 14 or 15 months ago or something's just completed I believe um that we construct a detention basin in burleigh park and drainage augmentation on williams street this is the botany botany bay foreshore study have we done anything about those that you know these completed a month later are we do we have a plan um do we have funding yeah well they're the things that will be addressed in the previous comments listed so sorry so have we have we done anything about those so how many I mean that would be something that I think we should really be aware of is you know imagine there are you know I'm sure you're more familiar with these documents than I am but I imagine when these studies are produced they all recommend a range of you know a range of mitigation measures I assume is that likely to be correct and what do we generally do about those so what generally happens with those options because at that point and this isn't having a guide this is our responsibility not yours so these options are assessed at this point they're fairly high level so what happens from that point is a feasibility study goes into play for those options that looks at it in more detail the burley option that you mentioned from memory involves frigid basically lowering the level of park by a meter from a flood mitigation point of view but it's an option that will reduce flood hazard but from the site management point of view taking a meter of material out of that part is not necessarily a practical option so there may be other ways of achieving a similar result without doing what was suggesting the flight plan risk management plan so in answer to your question the options that are identified through the flood plains management plan are further reviewed the feasibility of actually implementing what's decided don't look at other factors like the impacts of um removing the meter material yeah absolutely that's not you know getting a consultant to do this report I'm not suggesting we you know we immediately action every item in it um but I guess what I'm asking is what what actually happens when these recommendations are made I mean are there recommendations going back to the all these reports that were done in the year 2000 that have you know never seen the light of day so a number of actions have been completed from previous studies and when in an area like hayside relying on mitigation measurements is an unrealistic option I mean some things will help but the most effective measures are property-based measures which are what we have in our dcps minimum floor levels building with materials that are tolerant to flooding so you can wash them out and repair assist in the recovery after a flight event so there are several measures that have been implemented even with the gertrude street site we're looking at investigating flight storage on the side moment um but yeah there is actions that have taken have been implemented from these reports previously um so just to be clear that through the chair that this report that we moved from the last committee which was to the council officers for councils consideration and analysis of the impact of climate change on flood modelling and drug policy recommending sea level and rainfall parameters modeling over the whole of the local government area which was passed so when that is passed that will get incorporated into this planning document for future stormwater drainage plans across bayside is that correct so I'm sorry I don't care what was decided the last moment I think can I just can I just make a comment um chair I believe that the the report in the planning and environment committee was policy-based um talking about the c c level state increase statement and doing some modeling around that whereas um what we've got before us now is more operational measures around stormwater so I think there's a slight difference there I'm sure these things do overlap but for flood modeling and I'd just like to know that we are taking into consideration the future needs of the lga rather than just the present needs I i think those are already incorporated in flood management studies you know so the one I just opened up has a whole section on you know on climate these would be good I imagine what we're doing now will incorporate these considerations I've just had some advice so the answer is yes so the the report that you've just had from at the previous committee where there's been discussion and agreement on what scenarios will be modeled in any future blood studies that are undertaken those levels will be adopted so there will be a consistent approach so in terms of anyone any flood studies that need to be reviewed in future that's the basis on which they'll be studied you know whatever the agreed sea level rises were considered the last committee that's what we'll pick it up yeah it wasn't just sea level rises also flood plain the rainfall intensity and runoff that's the basis of determining the amount of rainfall for all flood studies and that's a requirement in the floodplain manual from the department from the state government so that's the basis of the flood of the rainfall behaviour the sea level rises is another factor that's built here I was going to say through the chairs we've got to understand that our infrastructure is pretty well fixed in other words the size of our pipe work under the streets like unless we undertook a massive undertaking of digging up every every residential street and going from this pipe to that pipe we're not going to change the dynamics of the way the water's collected and run off the only way we can do it is through the basic system where we try and keep on water retention on properties try and keep it there as long as we can and then that dissipates out the only issue with that the only issue with that obviously is it will come out eventually and under every rainfall we're still putting the can create all the reports we want in world definitely today we have to be able to cost them and put money towards fixing the entire network if we want to make a massive change and that's and that's a lot of and we're talking a lot of on the underground infrastructure and the thing is about under underground infrastructure you'll see through our people works especially the new councillors it's better to build a path than to build the drain under the park because you can cut the river off the park and overall be happy under the drain underneath isn't as exciting to the community that cuts oh great we've just built a two million dollar drain where you build a hundred thousand dollar part it's all exciting the kids can use it and life goes on one of the things I was going to point out to the councillors is we have an issue and I've diverted a little bit only for a quick moment we have an issue of loss of sand on the beach the beaches we have a report after report we've got a report recently that we need to do x y or z now there's no funding for that and I can tell you every week the same goes and every week that around for example there's a big black pipe you can see more and more of it now it's sticking in the air unless we bite the bullet and say we need to spend x amount of dollars we're not going to remedy that issue and that's what's called mitigation in the short term in the long term it might be a bigger issue it might mean in this case bill groins or or do whatever it needs to need to do under that report choose one of the options but we need to wipe the ball and move forward with it if we don't it's just more reports and more conversations and more rubber steps councilor curry thanks to the chair I think um it is as per the motion however we can't just ignore it we've got to funding grant funding opportunities that I know that council are currently looking into so let's don't let's try and get those grants and direct them to mitigation where it is has the most impact on our residents and then work our way through understanding that there are you know we can't do everything but let's get those key areas where there is risk where there is danger and secondly I think it's really important that we put more pressure on the government so whether it's transport um whether it's transport for roads or whether it's the water board in taking some responsibility for their assets that then have an impact on our area whether it's our roads or across properties and so on so from that perspective so in that report then um in do you mind can we put that up again please the motion I think that motion then allows us to um so what we're asking for is again we've done a number of flood step studies so let's just get a summary of has been really good for the residents I've sent that link from today's committee papers to a number of residents as well so which has been a really good tool to say this is what council's doing this is a really transparent process that they've appreciated being able to read and access easily and so that then we get a list of our hot spots we also hear from community you know so we can take that into consideration as well we then um also perhaps as part of this right to well again I guess out of the hot spots will come whose infrastructure it is right and at that at that next meeting then we can determine you know what pressure we need to put on who to step up yeah we've we've asked for the proactive maintenance schedules but they just don't come through well then we'll do it through council resolution and right that way sure because some of the areas might be for instance that one of bexley made it through the chair is there's a road a lot of kings are over the street tomorrow and that and that floods itself that little creek floods so whose infrastructure is that bodies all right is there any further discussion all those in favor all those against the cleric declare the committee meeting close at 8 31pm
Extraordinary council meeting the 23rd of february 2022 and we'll just check that we are online excellent so um welcome everybody welcome to our guests in the audience and welcome to the people listening at home tonight I now declare the meeting open at 7 02 pm so um if we just go through um members of the public that have registered to speak by audio visual link on an agenda item so I believe we have one speaker if you could if I could please ask you to keep your microphone muted and video off until I invite you to speak speakers will not be able to present material as part of their speaking time or share their screen so I asked councillors um also if we just review the requirements under the code of meeting practice and meeting etiquette including debate on an item will commence only once we have a mover and seconder for the item other than a merrell minute the mover of the motion has first right to speak on the motion the mover has a right of reply before the motion is put to speak and please indicate whether you are speaking for or against the motion so you can speak up to five minutes on a motion and a similar time for any amendment okay I also would like to remind everyone that video recording is an official record of council and may be made available to persons upon request in accordance with the government information public access act 2009 no other recordings are permitted I now move to item number one which is acknowledgment of country and auntie barb was was going to attend today to do welcome to country but unfortunately um she's had to be an apology for not for tonight's meeting due to a death in the family so our condolences to auntie barb and family and friends of uncle keith sims um antibab did request that on her behalf that we make some acknowledgments in relation to milestones and and this is linked um you know as as councillors will know we've got the rap which is on the agenda tonight as well so um so dulce sims is 92 today and um auntie so and then we've got auntie esme sims who turned 91 on valentine's day so we pass on our best wishes for their their birthdays and uh bayside council respects the traditional custodians of the land elders past and present on which this meeting takes place tonight and acknowledges the gadjagorn vigil clans of the sydney basin um I just wanted to speak on a couple of things so just the first one is I know I just wanted to say it's been very challenging couple of days with a relentless downpour of rain across sydney and I just wanted to thank and acknowledge the efforts of council staff who worked into the night and again today with ses and police to try and manage the situation so first of all and councils I'd also like us to just take a moment to acknowledge a member of our bayside community mr simon nellis we were all shocked and devastated by the shark attack that took place at little bay last week and on behalf of of bayside I'd just like to pass on our heartfelt councillors I now move to um the second agenda item and I would like to thank and invite reverend adam clark from saint stephen's agni church at east lakes to open the meeting in prayer please if you'd like to all be upstanding let us pray our father in heaven we thank you for the many blessings you have given to us for the life we have the relative peace and safety we enjoy for work rest family friendship and community lord we give you thanks the worst of the latest covered wave is behind us and father we do ask for your mercy upon our broken and divided world especially tonight we think of the ukraine lord please bless the efforts of all who are working for peace heavenly father I thank you for the staff and councillors of bayside council I pray that you would bless their labors as they seek to improve the lives of the residents of our area lord guide the councillors as they meet this evening give them wisdom in all their discussions bless them as they work together for the common christ our lord amen thank you very much reverend clark we now move to agenda item three which is apologies so as there are no apologies all councils are present tonight we've got no one on online this week all right disclosures of interest so I remind councillors that you should also notify the general manager in advance of the meeting of any disclosures of interest so that the we could assist them in at secretary and prepare them on the screen so any disclosures of interest must also be made at the meeting so I i would just like to disclose a to start by disclosing a significant non-pecuniary conflict of interest in relation to 7.7 on the basis that I attended a attended but purchased my own ticket for a fundraiser but the fundraiser was actually raising money for bayside women's shelter of which I am chair so I will leave the chamber for that item and ask the deputy chair to take the chair any other disclosures of interest thank you madame um I i have two items um in relation to 7.1 uh I attended the flag racing the greek independence flag racing serve service at um they're building in the hepa's buddhism rockdale I was invited as a as a counselor which I previously cleared and in relation to 7.7 same item I'm declaring a less significant uh non-procurement interest 14 years ago I had a christening at the building for my son I haven't been there that restaurant for a number of years by choice um but I will be in the chamber as I believe this is uh it's a less than significant declaration thank you hi in relation to item 7.7 I'm declaring a less than significant non-pecuniary interest I also attended the fundraiser I purchased my own ticket and I will be staying in the chamber I'd also I'd also like to declare a less than significant non-pecuniary interest in item 7.7 I was at the same um fundraising uh dinner for which you know we bought our own tickets so just wanted to declare that thank you thank you councilwoon and that sometimes happens when we um supporting community initiatives function councillor rewarder madame uh less than uh significant number you know interest on item 7.1 as a member of my family lives in close proximity to the site thank you councillor will you be leaving the chamber or no I'll be voting on it thanks thank you um councillor douglas thank you madam mayor um I declare two things tonight I declare a less than significant non-pecuniary conflict of interest in item 7.6 on the basis of perception as I am part of peaceful bayside that advocates for a creative bay side and I'll be in the room for the discussion and vote and as well as attending the function that you also intended I will actually be declaring a significant non-pecuniary conflict of interest on item 7.7 on the basis of perception as elias zortsis a candidate at the council election on the 4th of december 2021 is the son-in-law of the leasi of the lasanne's restaurant and he gave me preferences as his third preference at the election on that basis I will leave the chamber and not be present for the consideration and are there any further disclosures of interest kim madam chair item 7.1 less than the significant not purely interest that and I've declared this in the past that I'm a former member of this organization but I've not participated in any committee work that they've undertaken um item again I've visited this restaurant many times living in the area for for 25 years so I must have gone there maybe two 300 times in the past few years but I have no connection with the operator at all thank you thank you councillor soonest no further disclosures all right thank you councillors the disclosures will be noted in the minutes all right councillors I now move towards um item five which is in relation to the the mayoral minute and I just like to say that um in relation to putting this mayoral minute forward around um you know the racism not welcome campaign so this is um which local councils have been asked to embrace and promote as part of harmon harmony day which is observed each year on march 21. so harmony day cultural diversity and aims to foster inclusiveness and respect which are things as bayside council we we strive for being a welcoming inclusive community so and as we know councillors the um cultural wealth of australia is steeped in its diversity and um some of us were present last night at the citizenship ceremony and just seeing the range of cultures and hearing their stories is is just a wonderful experience so what in relation to this we I see this as another step towards building a community that is inclusive and accepting of everyone and racism sadly does exist and many of us here who are first-generation australians have experienced racism and it's racism is a learnt response it is people we're not born that way children learn it from the community they live in the country they live in so I think it's up to us as leaders as community leaders to do all we can to ensure that residents feel they truly belong and are safe and respected and so this is um just by joining this and I just want to make it or suggesting that signs are going to pop up all over residential streets that's not the intent of this there may be appropriate places that that council can determine such as the pcyc or the um that you know the area downstairs where the library is and um so that just wanted to um explain the intent there of um the mayoral minute so I move that the merrell minute be adopted and um as per the recommendations there and ask if there's any discussion you councillor thank you madam mayor I'm pleased yeah um so uh in november 2020 independent counselor pauline lockheed brought a motion to inner west council to secure its endorsement for the racism not welcome campaign and the street signs were part of a larger campaign which included a video an art exhibition with an anti-racism theme stickers and signs for businesses and a major community event revolving around the international day for elimination of racial discrimination on march 21st I spoke to council loki lockheed about this and she said the street signs are designed to be a unifying and visible initiative to develop its own further banners at the grassroot level I also spoke to rosanna barbaro from the addison road community organization about the campaign and she suggested other ways the community can get involved like campaigns in schools and potentially even a bayside council audit around diversity and gender to improve future planning and participation so they both uh we're very excited that bayside council might be getting behind this and urge that we um layer it in with some extra community initiatives uh to ensure that it becomes a two-way conversation with the community about the issues thank you no thank you councillor douglas and um you know just and councillors will know we we host a very successful multicultural event each year we also do a number of things of harmony day and this year council will be lighting up both rockdale and botany town hall in the color of orange for harmony day so I think you know having a range of initiatives is vital thank you councillor jansen thank you madam mayor I just wanted to say that I'm in support of celebration of culture and diversity in the area and I believe that this can send strong messages to the community if these signs are placed around our community assets our community centres maybe even skate parks I'd also like to see a as based on what council douglas said a community education campaign rolled out with this as I'm sure is already on the cards so thank you thank you councillor jackson are there any other speakers councillor hannah madam mayor I hope I can speak freely on this so I just want to I just want to be clear that I'm definitely not against anything that is proposed to in any way try and suppress racism that may exist but I must admit I was shocked to see this come up as a mayoral minute because there's been a lot of publicity about how this has actually divided a community particularly in walara and it's evidenced by the fact that the actual council over there is very finely divided on it and I i even though it's not intended if you have a a suggestion that people are racist and I know in this community that is definitely not the case I really think that we can actually embrace something like this but have something more positive I don't think having signs you know whether they'd be strategically placed with a negative message is the way to go I personally think we should be embodying in our normal signage and it could be done without any cost when signs are replaced where we could say something along the lines of bayside council we've got serving our community maybe we could have something like a welcoming community or all-inclusive community I just think this throws off inferential accusation and having watched this in the media I really don't believe we should be going down this path because this has got the capacity to divide a community not united I think the thinking behind it's fine but I think the message is negative and I think we need to turn that around into a positive message and if that was the case I'd be more than happy to support can't thank you thank you councillor hannah are there any further speakers mcdougall thank you madam mayor and thank you for uh bringing on this motion I think it's a fantastic initiative I understand where councilor hannah's coming from but I do have to respectfully disagree I think this is in fact a very positive campaign we're making clear that in our community racism isn't welcome you know it's not making accusations against any anybody um there are no inferences to be drawn um this is simply the fact that we are a wonderful multicultural community we're one of the most multicultural communities in the state um and we're joining with councils who have very successfully run this like in a west council like the city of sydney like cumberland council where it has been very successful so I fully support the motion and welcome it for our city thank you council mcdougall are there any further speakers madame um I do speak to you yes I did send a sign I actually was shocked the way it was worded I don it's red and white so some george might be happy but they might not be happy about the sign and south on the other side east side you better put it red and green because otherwise they'll be unhappy so I remember that I did look at their website I couldn't see anything they do I don't know who they are they sell t-shirts and that was but and to you you've got to unify the the community and I think you're dividing the community one of the girls that ran with me it was number three her husband works for immigration department he could not believe this was the wording that we want we're happy to put up another one of resident email me tonight I rang him back because I've known them for years he said they put a sign up in my street I will take it down he believes and that's that's the I think you're feeling you're going to get but I'm going to move a motion and it's come from so I think it's fairly new that the mayoral minute must be deferred because when a mayoral minute makes a recommendation which if adopted would require the expenditure of funds on works and or services other than those already approved provided for in the council's current adopted operational plan it must identify the source of funding for the expenditure because we don't know how much it's going to cost that is the I can't reach it's so small the writing this is the subject of the recommendation if the mayoral minute does not identify a funding source the council must defer consideration of the matter pending a report from the general manager on the availability of funds for implementing implementing the recommendation if adopted we've got that at the base at the base of it but the code of meeting practice says we cannot adopt it until we get the report back so I'm moving that this is deferred until the report comes back from the general manager which is a part of the recommendation because technically we can't approve it that this is deferred until we have the report back from the general manager identifying the funds as per clause 9.10 of the coder meeting practice thank you council hello um councillor uh madame maybe I can assist in moving forward and through you to the director of city performance without putting you on the spot do we have an idea for such a thing the costing did we knowing that this is coming about do we have an id 100 150 sorry to put you on the spot I think if we get an idea and if if let's for example it's a hundred thousand where would the funding come from um through the mayor councillors if you have a look at the motion itself it actually isn't asking council to invest any funding the background does talk about some of the possibilities and notes that a report would need to come back if there is expenditure to be um to be expended but if you look at the actual notion it's worded in such a way that it talks about agreeing um with the talks about endorsing a campaign looking for partnership opportunities taking that those those five points there is no investment required at this moment in time but should we look to do any other elements of a campaign that requires investment we would need to come back to you and that's noted in the body of the report yeah thank you for explaining that I was just trying to assist you moving forward and I commend you madame may for this mural minute racism does exist and I've experienced it myself okay I migrated I was eight years of age and I thank my father for choosing australia I thank him every day actually he could have went to america germany god knows will when I was educated at bexley primary school and may he rest in peace mr ron rathbun he was my teacher and he was actually the person that encouraged me to be on this council in 2004. now everyone used to call me a wob and I used to get upset I got into a lot of fights and then till he pulled me over stands for western oriental gentleman so every time people would call me I walked I would smile and that got them more upset another incident when we started eating a lebanese bread which was never heard of at that time I used to roll it like a kebab and eat it and everyone would look at me and say ah you such as such go back to where you came from and guess what this is multiculturalism now there's give up stores everywhere and guess what everyone loves a quebec racism does exist minority I agree but it should not happen so I will support that on the basis of racism should not exist at all in our community we live in harmony multicult especially bayside and you will said in your citizenship they're from all over uh different cultures different worlds so I'll support that a minute thank you thank you councillor naji so um councillor barlow's got a motion is it an amendment um I can't see it on the screen okay we have an amendment is there a second up for the thank you councillor hannah therefore um can we just get a ruling on that amendment she's asked for a code of meeting practice point of view through you madame is there is that a is that out of line or is that yes so it um as indicated by the um from what the general manager said um that it already indicates in the report that a report will come to council and it is not committing council to any funds so therefore I think that the amended motions being dealt with the wording is very clear we cannot vote for it until the funding is sourced that is the wording and you can pass it up but so yeah the rule well the ruling is there is no funding so therefore um the amendment can the amendment cannot be so we'll put the amendment all right there's an amendment they're so happy to put the amendment um which is um the mayoral minute be deferred until a report comes back to council um there so um so we'll put the amendment to the motion okay I declare the amendment lost therefore I will put the original motion so council abalo has called a division on the amendment amendment so all those that are in favor of the amendment please put up your hand I note we have councillor hannah councillor barlow and councillor tsunas now all those against the amendment please put up your hand we have councillor morrissey councillor musket councillor fardell councillor janssen council anarchy councillor saranovsky councillor werner councillor douglas councillor mcdougall and councillor sedrak oh sorry casarawata have you got all those excellent thank you so now I will put the original motion all those in favor of the original motion say I against I declare that carried well we will call um we will call a division um as requested by councillor barlow and therefore all those in favor of the original motion please put up your hands I shall go around the room again councillor morrissey councillor musket councillor fardell councillor jansen councillor nargi council saranovsky councillor tsunus joined us councillor werner councillor wada councillor douglas councillor mcdougall councillor cedric all those against the motion is counselor hannah now um move for suspension slam lawyers to raise an item in in the passing of um the late john raper and also norm proven thank you yes please go ahead counselor the reason I rise is that a number of um sporting people have approached me and I did have the opportunity to meet both of them norm the late norm proven actually had a furniture shop here in rockdale um and um as a child now that was uh that's harvey norman yeah that was their first store um and I had the pleasure over the last ten years to meet uh mr raper I always refer to him as mr raper for me uh vladimir um he was an inspirational person and inspired a lot of young kids to play rugby league and the activities yeah that's what I was going to say he was very much a community orientated person the late norm program was very mild compared to the late john raper um as I said I had the opportunity to know him for the last um probably 10 or 15 years and an absolute character and he was a typical mate and what he achieved in football he put back into being able to talk to people and I'll just share a story with you um as we all know some may not know I don't drink alcohol and the late mr john raper used to always well frequently would go to alois hotel and I was the gopher to get the alcohol because he'd be virtually gone because he was because he'd love a drink so I would go up to the bar and order beers for and I used to always call him mr um mr rape I never called him johnny raper I called him mr oak because the utmost respect that I had for him and I wanted to raise it tonight um matamir was the fact that his funeral is on monday and it's a state funeral but I think in terms of the st george area and seen the videos of the games and and talked to a lot of people from st george he was such an inspirational player I him after and I think it was just fitting that we note in a minute that um the past you know law proven and also um john johnny wapo thank you thank you for allowing it no thank you council sarah nowski and just um for the purposes of procedure my apologies I needed to put that um we were happy to vote on the procedural motion so all those in favor say aye against declare it carried so thank you very much councillor saronoski for um for sharing that all right so um the motion so we put the motion that um council acknowledges the recent passing um of johnny raper an immortal in the rugby league world johnny raper played a vital role in this george dragon's 11 years of straight premiership wins in the national rugby league so is there any further discussion to the motion so I have a mover counselor saranovsky and a secondary counselor naji any discussion all right we then put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried okay we will now be moving into public forum so some councillors have declared an interest in this item as as I have and I will now leave the chair and I will ask the deputy chair to come and proceed over this item okay thank you councillors we have got one uh one speaker in the public forum mr mark assad who is the applicant speaking for the officer recommendation have we got mr assad on the line uh hello yes can you hear me yes thank you mr assad please go ahead thank you um for starters I would like to thank uh thank yourself for the opportunity to talk this evening and also like to thank the officer for their recommendation and their report we agree with these findings on behalf so I'm the I'm the applicant for the development application that was launched previously for the alterations and additions to the re-facade of the republic bar and grill so nevertheless we agree with these findings and we look forward to a swift development application following uh tonight's result of course um following tonight's determination if favorable um we'll be lodging questions for the councillors I'm happy to provide any relevant town planning related questions to answer if necessary thank you thank you mr assad does any counsellors have any questions for mr assad while he's available no okay can we have a mover in a second or for the motion please counselor fadel and counselor naji thank you is there any speakers got a few questions on the matter mr chair um this suggests it's asking for landowners consent have we got consent from the lessee to start with because we deal with the let's see we don't really deal with republic or the applicants in this case when it comes to our tenancy arrangements all right so let's answer that question mr mamo to address that question through the chair um yes we um we do have a consent from the headlessee and as landowner now council is required to consider whether they will be concerned so we have written a written request from the lessee that we can view if we have to okay is that current let's see up to that we deal with are we up to date I'm not asking for numbers I'm allowed to talk I'm asking are we up to date because in my view if we're expanding the footprint of the lessee and allowing more tangible area we should be up to date what we're doing because we hassle other smaller operators yet this larger one tends to be a flagmast operator in the area if I can get an answer thank you council students my understanding there is a confidential paper here if you wish to debate that I would suggest we move to a confidential session at the end of the current proceedings we are in the public forum at the moment and uh that that may touch there um if I can suggest though um that given the there is a there's there may be some issues there that need to be discussed that councils may need may wish to familiarize themselves with that we defer this matter to the next committee meeting the committee start next month where we can tease out and discuss any that this matter would go to the committee committee the the questions and answers will be provided at that committee and it would come back to the next uh ordinary council meeting at the end of march so councillor fardel would you yes I'm just wondering if there's any relevance to this because if the lee see the the uh actually see there's an issue with rental that's an issue between council and the lee sea when we decided on hurricane we never brought those issues into consideration to punish hurricane and it seems like that we are going to take that into account and which will affect the uh what is it called the republic of shisha republic yeah this sub this is sublessing okay so I can't see the relevance there I think we could deal with this notice of motion and if there is any issue with the lee c then the council would take the appropriate process to deal with that so I i think we can deal with the uh the motion in front of us there thank you just as I said it sounds like there's a bit of discussion to be had and if you're looking at 0.3 there um we really need to move into confidential at the end of this meeting so um is every are we happy to do that can we move that way sorry can we move that way in a second to move that and yeah if there's a second we can go down that path councillor mcdoodle so it's resolved we'll move we'll uh defer this until the end of the meeting we'll go into confidential at that time thank you there's a confidential um there's a confidential paper at uh attached to this motion and it's been resolved that we will be moving into a confidential session at the end of of them towards the end of the meeting sorry on that okay all in favor of moving this into a confidential session at the end all in favor say aye declare it carried so uh mistress I will advise you of the outcome um uh after the uh end the mayor and councillor douglas uh back into the chamber please oh okay um thank you councillor morrissey for taking the chair we now move to the reports and we start with 7.1 and I believe there's some people that um no one's the non-ficunary less than significant no one leaving the chamber of this one all right okay um so we have um 72 item 7.1 72 laycock street bexley north in relation to the agreement for lease with order of a hepa so um there's an office rec office's recommendation before us do I have a mover ombudsman madam um moved councillor saranovsky do I have a secondar councillor barlow is there any would you like to speak is there any discussion on the matter a handful of questions so after through you madame to the general manager after the 20 days of elapsed so 20 days we've given this organization 20 days to get their house in order which is almost 6 years plus 20 days but that's ok so 20 days what happens after that 20 days what further extension future officer's recommendation I know it's a rhetorical question to a point however there must be a point where we need to draw the line in the sand this is a community asset that's not looked after whereabouts it's gone down the toilet so to speak the residents want to know what's going on I know there's a new da that's gone in the old da information has disappeared so there's no reference to that when people go on the portal that's that's a discussion for another day but maybe we're going to get an answer to this one first thank you thank you general manager uh through the chair um the recommendation uh does include returning this item to council in 20 days if the default has not been remedied so I think you'll see that what we're recommending is that issue the notice and if that is not if the default is if the fault is not rectified and there is only the one outstanding matter which is the bank guarantee if that's not for the march council meeting for council to consider the next steps that it wants to take I also note that item five tends to item five talks about a rezoning of the site now that that pertains and goes back to the actual application that's been made subject to the payment of the bank guarantee and so on can we remove that and deal with just the default notice in this in this instance and then if we need to come back in 20 days or if they pay it up ahead then we can put item five back onto the council agenda and rezone the land to suit the needs of this particular group because I i can't understand where we've thrown that in you know amongst the default nurses we've just put it in there just for just for the sake of moving forward now who knows if they're going to move forward we've waited so long uh through the mayor um what is intended there is for council really to note that there will be um a requirement for the remedied so it's not to occur now it should the default be remedied so we're simply putting it out there so that you're aware of it but no action will be taken on that point until the default matter is dealt with the question who pays for the reclassification I've just realized now I shouldn't have seconded it because that clause 5 does concern me because the application before us doesn't comply at all unless that land use is changed so who pays for the classification uh through it through you madam mayor um I believe we do pay for that okay so is there any further discussion before right of reply no further discussion right or reply counsel no I was just not alright I was just going to just make a couple of comments uh madame the in terms of um the motions be moved I believe is fair and reasonable I'm quite happy for number five to remain um the only sticking point um is is in relation to the bond um and in terms of um like I'm's happened for the last six years and 20 days but just say I'm just going to say a couple things the proposal I haven't seen the new proposal so I can't really comment and I can't uh try and influence any of the staff which was a bit my understanding was this was for a community facility uh who was going to be a cultural center now um in relation to um the five and that's what I want to agree to is that because they've lodged the da the staff have to assess the I assume we're going to go to independent um planner to assess the d.a now whether the da is approved or rejected I don't know I can't comment on that but I just wanted to say that this is a community organization they've got a number of problems and I was actually shocked and horrified that I didn't get a fax one minute before the meeting from the other side first time ever we didn't get any letters from the other side is I hope the other side and this at least will get together and come up with a common bond and that is to try and achieve the intention from the start was to have a cultural facility for the youth of the area now yes the building is pretty run down yep I go past every second day there's an every second week there's a nice pizza shop around the corner bexy north I go there it's a beautiful pizza shop and I do see the building this it is it deteriorates I just wanted to say the name the building is seriously deteriorating condition but hepa to their credit have paid for a rent for the last two and a half years with no access to the building so who in their right might be paying rent and not actually have access to the building this puts them on notice but someone noticed that to get their fares in in in order and if they comply with that outstanding issue I'm sure this council will be proud of the finished product when it does cork the court matters that have been raised over the last three four years but I'm hoping that something will come up and they'll be able to pay the bonds if they pay up the bond then it's a tick and off we go and try and resolve that issue once and for all thank you councillor saranovsky councillor najib to the director of city futures has there been a new da and if there has the process how long does it normally roughly takes um through you madame there has been a new application lodge with council just in the last week the information is complete as far as we can see in the fees have been paid um so that process is ready to start it will most likely be determined by the local planning panel and most likely on the grounds that we will receive a number of submissions that's what we expect so in terms of the assessment we will decide whether we engage an external consultant to do that work for us and that will also have an impact on process goes so um the other factor in it is of course um how the application um stacks up in terms of planning controls and the objections that we received and whether there's a need for it to be some aspects of it to be revisited and amended information to be lodged so in terms of time frame with all those variables in there it's a little bit hard to say it will be a number of months I would expect at least you I'm just going to say golly golly gumdrops that's an old one I am an old person it's becoming a real concern because this process could take another 12 months it's already been last time we debated heavily and other as well the new council it was five years now it's six years and it could be another year before another day let me tell you that I i was privy on the eastern panel and this would be the third day that the group organization so the question here is why why are we letting this happen seven and audrey's property or councillor hannah or councillor saranovsky or anyone this is the community this is injustice to the community why why are we letting this happen and I'm not here now politically is it because a liberal member was there from the liberal side or is there liberal uh labour party members why I'm not alleging anything but why we're letting this happen I've asked again again tell me all around australia has anyone experienced through this a council anywhere any council around australia not just new south wales where a tender has been awarded and six seven years later nothing has happened there hasn't nothing has really happened nothing has it should have been done okay and let me remind this council that originally when the tender was there a hepa through corporate scorecard the corporate school card that this uh department assessed them on because of due diligence to assess their financial they score 2 out of 10 and I can't believe it that last year we extended we keep propping up extended extended extended to give him the told by february if they don't come up with the bond we will do something about it okay they're in breach but look the only way because I'm really concerned about this community facility I'm really concerned about the process not alleging anything but I am starting to feel very uncomfortable six years later and from the director's mouth that we don't know how long the day process will take it's got to go to the local panel this could be another year or year and a half and nothing is going to happen on that side and I don't want to hear excuses about oh it's in a derelict state let me tell you why it's in a derelict state because it's been vacant no one was looking after it three bridges I think uh I've you know intended for it they were one of their favorites I'm sure they would have have done it in operating and serving the community with their programs or whatever seven years the question is why why are we letting put the pressure on to either provide the money because they haven't been able to and when the money is provided where it came from if the organization cannot provide it and someone else puts the money that should be a major concern to this council how they're going to build their d.a if they rely on other people to support now last question do my council is here would we have allowed this to any other organization would we have allowed them six to seven years to any other organization I bet you and I know that the answer would have been no thank you council naji um so just is there any other you've had an opportunity counselor sooner questions before yeah we'll just see if there's anyone else please counselor hannah thank you madam mayor look um I agree with everything council and nazi has said now I wasn't_''_3321.599 on the previous council but I was on the council before that where this was discussed so that's that's 2012 to 2016. so I'm actually quite shocked to come matter now there's a general philosophy that I like to approach when I'm dealing with business matters don't allow yourself to have someone else's problems put upon you and that's what we seem to be getting into here so I think we've really got to draw a line in the sand and I mean if there's no one out there that can actually deliver what needs to be delivered this might be a matter where heaven forbid council might have to look at doing something itself why why isn't that looked at as an option so I'm fully in support of doing the 20-day notice because six years is just far too long and and the other thing that needs to be born in mind is that the the bank guarantee is probably significantly insufficient significantly insufficient because construction costs have actually gone through the roof aluminium has gone up 38 percent in the last 12 months timber's gone up between 40 and 50 if you can get it steel's gone up there's a there's a shortage about a million and a half bank guarantee it it seems to me that it's nowhere near enough to cover what this council could be exposed to in the event that this they don't deliver so that's another issue that really has to be looked at so you know we've really got to get this moving because this is embarrassing thank you madam mayor thank you councillor hannah um are there any people that haven't spoken that would like to speak council balance I actually I have seconded that which I didn't realize I'd forgotten about clause five can I have an explanation for clause five does that mean we're changing it so we're expanding the use of the land because at the moment I've looked at some of the all the people that said the existing use rights they've got to prove they've got existing use rights because the application is for a club now I don't I just want to know what clause fighting is involved um we'll might just get the manager of ask a question and they are allowed to have a club there now as a a club that's open till midnight or no 11 o'clock on 1am at the moment they can't but um I have read quite a few of the application responses before it's all about existing use right so I don't know if that's helping them or not I would like to know that because the community doesn't want a club there so advice is there would be no existing use rights because they would have expired yes so then that would form part of the the next steps in relation to okay so the existing uses rights have expired why are they bothered to put a da in with out they don't obviously don't learn okay well I'm a bit concerned I think you know the residents in that area are going to be find it very difficult when the it goes out on exhibition I think it's on exhibition now I mean why did they take till the 11th hour the 11th of february three months and another three months but anyway I'm I'll still second it or make sure I vote against it but um existing news shots have expired so they have now problems to do their vlogs thank you council balo all right um is there any further discussion council soonest did you thank you now this is long long and drawn out I've never been against this application but I've examined it no let me finish council mcdougall please you are about chinese trips and levels councillor tunis please continue sorry excuse me you want to repeat that council or sonos I heard you actually should we play back the recording if you want to thank you councillors um I hope that at one moment please thank you I i missed anything but I hope that we are abiding by appropriate behaviour not making unnecessary comments thank you uh thank you councillor cedric please council cedric please go ahead and yeah so I've never been against this application but the merits of it have fallen apart it's been here for way way too long came to the table I did support it and then a lot of holes started peeking through the the veneer of what was being put up there and then all the drama of the two are hepas doing whatever that's that's by the side here we're dealing with what the application is in front of us an extension of what this organization wants to do moving forward so I hope that in the next 20 days they can get their house in order bring us a bank check put it in the in the account that's it or guarantee whichever format they do but there's still some things that really concern me like today we mentioned existing use rights I'd like to ask if their existing use rights have lapsed do we need to go back to the minister to request something else or is that sufficient in clause five to move forward because the way I understood it was general use means um sorry sports ground means we need to get a general use classification to allow parking within that sports facility because the sports crowd yeah so that's so exciting soon as I might just interrupt you there so I think um at the moment we're just dealing with the recommendations so at those point at this point it's about the breach of notice and that is what the recommendation is talking about so let's deal with these recommendations now and those other matters will it will come back to council depending on what what happens in the next 20 days bring them back to the table or do we need to bring back more a change of a change of zoning or whatever it takes to get them back on the board to allow whatever facility they need can we get an answer to that um through the chair um as I said earlier this is actually flagging a process that will occur should the breach be remedied nothing will occur until that happens it's simply saying to counsel that in parallel with the da being considered there will also be a a reclassification of the land from sporting and general community use to general community that site should this go ahead it's that that's really all that's about and at this point we're taking no further action but I still don't I don't so I'm part of my ignorance that's planning spec what what does that mean does that mean that currently it's a sporting field and because we changed the classification we're allowed to park the vehicles on the site um what this it's actually about the shrinking of the number of bowling greens so previously a lot of the site was given over to the bowling greens themselves now there the proposal the current proposal is to shrink that number substantially and to have a different sort of outdoor recreation space with car parking the general community use will permit them to do what they have included in the da that has been submitted thank you councilwells I'm going to um I i think we've sufficiently answered those last last question because I well I think it's been explained quite clearly what they what what the importance necessary my after the 20 days does that current that resolution still impact upon whoever else comes in to be part of that land we might we might put it out to tender again does that impact the new tenderer uh madame look I i just want to move that this motion be put because the the questioning we're going around in circles and council as soon as just holding the whole council on one item uh number five now the bottom line is uh in the recommendation number four overwrites everything else now counselor soonest is speculating that in 21 days what would happen if this happened or that happened we want to put this motion and we'll look at it in 20 days or next council meeting thank you okay that's been second then the motion be put councillor saranovsky right of reply no all right all those in favor of the motion say aye against the motions being put the recommendation is being put oh sorry all right so we vote on the um that the motion be put all those in favor say aye against in favor of the motion say aye against declare it carried councillor barlow would like her name recorded against the recommendation in report 7.1 all right thank you very much we now move to 7.2 which is update to the botany aquatic center I have a mover councillor musket seconded council morrissey is there any discussion all right or I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now move to um 7.3 the tender to rosebury town center and that this count moved council nigel seconded councillor jansen is there any discussion no all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we move on to 7.4 this is the tender in relation to the ss rock tree maintenance services there is an officer recommendation before us either moved councillor mcdougall seconded council or awada is there any discussion I might just give the mover the first right of reply councilman thank you councillor hannah thank you madame just a question um does this mean that council doesn't carry out its own tree maintenance anymore and I seem to remember that pickers and um I know we never had stump grinding which disappointed me greatly but does this does this mean that this has all been contracted out or is it a mix or it is a mix yeah we continue to do it do we still have the cherry we might just defer to um mr klissel um through you metamer uh yeah we still do have the all the equipment we run about eight staff um throughout that operation they do remedial pruning um dead wooding emergency services but at times you know we do need additional contractors to come in and help us thank you madame thank you thank you is there any further discussion okay I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right councillors we move to item 7.5 um which is thank you councillor our morrissey seconded councillor mcdougall we have an officer recommendation before us which recommends the terms of reference for each committee changes the committee meeting timing this is based on feedback from councillors when the report was put to the last council meeting it the first and second wednesdays of the month sequentially so councillors who wish to can attend every committee and it also asked to appoint the chair deputy chair members of each of the four committees so I have a mover it was second and wasn't it yes it was yeah thank you thank you madame um just just a couple of just a very minor changes to um remove the word advisory from the the committee they're not advisory committees our committees of council and also uh an amendment to the terms of reference 5.1 in each uh in each uh committee it's all it's the same there it's it's fairly generic but um 5.1 be amended to make it clear that the committee comprises councillors only is that okay with you councillor mcdougall thank you the nominations uh have been provided to governance and I think we've got that on the screen and they'll be moving that uh they'll be accepted they're adapting adopted thank you councillor morrissey all right so following consultation following the um opportunity for all consulting with all councillors um over the phone so these these are the committees that are being put forward tonight so um we've had we've got a mover and a seconder so there you go all right okay I just okay thank you the question is does the committee who's decided on the chairs and deputy chairs that shouldn't be I don't know who that is so they're um those are being um those nominations are being put forward the council chair and the deputy chair has got to be voted for by the committee as far as I know I've put those forward counsellor councillor balo for um determination we put that's what we're putting the motion up to adopt uh this structure all right is there any further discussion just the question madame if someone wanted to change one of those committees whether now or later on is that possible so the the terms of these committees are in line with the mayoral term that we're on the sport and wreck committee last term for four years are the knowledge I just want to know if they're back on that committee so if you if um I can't I don't know so yeah we have um the people that were on there was councilman morrissey council anarchy councillor saronoski and councillor awada so yeah sooners and they came to every meeting yeah that I remember yeah yeah all right well thank you so any further discussion all right then I um put the motion all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried all right we moved to item 7.6 this is the um proposed grant applications due for submission in february march so a nice tight timeline again for grants and there's um move by council naji seconded by councillor saranovsky would you like to speak to it is there any further discussion um councillor douglas um I do want to I am speaking in support of this but I do also want to um point out a few things that I feel like would be great for council to think about in the future in terms of these sorts of and previously it has not funded sporting grounds rather land use for green and recreational purposes I would love to see bayside council look at applying for funding to open up the eve street wetlands for community use and or a mountain bike track around the perimeter of riverine park there is a lot more to using green space than sporting clubs and these grants are meant to address critical shortfalls in freely accessible public spaces we already know that residents are complaining that they can't access the synthetic field now at gardiner park as they can't book it as they don't belong to a sporting club we can't lock up all our green spaces for use with sporting clubs let's get the balance right here in regards to the open spaces playgroup program play program let's in future consider a pump track and a mountain bike track for our community there are already renegade pump tracks at joseph banks park and at the eve street wetland we've seen from the overt success of the skate park at west botany street that build free activities for our families and youth like the remarkable mount and mountain bike paths people come from all over sydney to enjoy that similarly the places to swim grant as a resident I presented to the previous mayor sarah vanowsky a survey completed by bayside residents asking for more paddling facilities in the area I asked for consideration of these facilities for this grant but nothing has been tabled whilst they do support the st george model vote club receiving council support I do hope in the future that bayside council will embrace our rivers and coastal playgrounds by submitting by soliciting funds for more paddling facilities for stand-up paddleboards and kayaks paddling and kayaks or stand-up paddle pop boards is a healthy peaceful low-impact activity for fitness and for the whole family thank you thank you councillor douglas for um sharing thoughts around you know us being cognizant of um a range of of different initiatives that are all important within our community bicycle track or a pump bike track would be great I actually had one in my backyard I worked it out it was 40 years fantastic and we were doing the sewer and we had all this problem so I had all the neighborhood in there riding their push bikes with over the humps and all sorts of things but the problem with that is it does destroy the land you've got to be very careful where you put it because of the fact of what your wear and tear and if it's in the wetlands you just gotta respect that so I know the kids love it but I'm not sure where in rockdale we can put it but it wouldn't be near the wetlands as far as I could tell because of the going through there you've got to respect that as well yeah thank you council bala any further discussion all right I'm right of reply it was possible I want to congratulate the staff for putting up a list of what we're going for for the proposed grants and I think you've done well you've covered a wide variety of things I mean I've always said vegas can't_''_4672.0 be choosers to issue those grants and I keep hearing about riverine park I just want to mention that riverine park has been sitting idle with nothing happening for the last 12 years and since we started to think that what we could do for grassroots clubs and having a sporting hub and that includes everybody not just soccer we're talking about rugby league we're talking about cricket and you know you get people still not happy about it let's get the grants first then we'll come in I'm sure we'll be going out for community consultation because it is a must but we are elected councillors on behalf of this community all community all wards and we are here to make decisions for the vision for this city and at the end of the day when we decide what we're going to do of course we must go to community consultation and you know we keep bringing up synthetic fields we have learned a lot and I for one that was always for synthetic I wind until I get a report from an independent not then I will decide what I would do but at the moment I'm not doing nothing so everyone needs we all love open space we all love trees we all love nature I don't think there's one counselor here who isn't for the environment so let's think about the community the youth we have a big number of youth our statistics we took statistics in this council back in 2008 or 2012 and it says this area this side of the rock delgia and I'm sure now since we amalgamated there's a lot on the other side there's a lot of sporting activities a lot of sporting organizations and we must support sport it doesn't matter whether it's soccer rugby league cricket whatever we did with that net pool we we gave a big upgrade we went for an upgrade to make sure that they get a better facility and that is for netball so I recommend the stuff thank you thank you council maji all right I put the recommendation all those in favor say aye against declare the public forum and it will go to the closed session so I moved to 7.8 which is the proposed classification of affordable housing units at east gardens is operational land move council morrissey seconded councillor janssen um is there would you like to speak to it uh only just to say that uh this is a result this is this is one of the good outcomes we get from from planning from time to time all too often our hands are tied we're we've got a lot of over development going on area but this is actually a benefit to our community where we're getting affordable affordable housing to offer to those that need it most we have a very good operator running that on our behalf and it's really exciting when now that these are being delivered after years and years and years of talk we can actually go and uh you know represent our community and and give them support their housing needs um at an affordable cost so it's a it's a it's a very good outcome thank you discussion I put the recommendation all those in favor say aye against declare it carried this takes us to 7.9 which is the draft art policy I have a mover councillor jansen seconded councillor mcdougall um councillor janssen would you like to speak I've reviewed um the dr thank you madam I've reviewed the draft policy and there's some things that I'd like to have considered in this policy so I'm moving an amendment that this item is deferred to the first relevant committee meeting thank you thank you is there a second uh to councillor jansen seconded councillor mcdougall sorry so we've got um the motion which is to defer the item to the relevant committee uh so all those in favor of the motion say aye against declare it carried all right that takes us to uh 7.10 which is the um the draft um or the sorry the the reconciliation action plan and and I just want to say this is um a lot of work's gone into this it's um you know as a as a diverse nation a range of cultures being inclusive and you know but first and foremost um we acknowledge that our history did begin with our first nations people and it's important that we do recognize our history and this reconciliation action plan before you tonight is just the beginning and it is an important first step to building these partnerships and working together and it will lay the foundation for future apps and reconciliation initiatives through a program of actions and deliverables developed in consultation with community with elders and key stakeholders and I would like to think there was a range of community members over a period of time who a number of meetings held and I attended some of them as well where there was a lot of consultation um across a lot of people I'd like to thank those community members I'd like to thank our elders who provided valuable input I'd like to thank both the metro and la peru's land councils and then also council staff who were our aboriginal and torres strait islander staff who contributed and then our community life has gone into this and it is it will be an evolving document there so um I just so you you've um had the opportunity to have a look at that um is so can I have a mover I'll move them out of me um counselor saranovsky seconded councillor janssen um can I make a suggestion um um we've got point one where we've um can we add um that we sent a copy to all our mps yep and when I say all that all the local inputs upper house and lower house send them a copy and our federal member linda bernie she's um if we can send her a copy um I think it's important for this kind of statement that at least we notify our local members of our position so um thank you councillor saranovsky we can add that um counselor just reminded me um we have the member for cook we never see so if we can maybe send him a copy thank you um councillor jansen thank you madam med I'd like to support your's a really terrific document and I think we should be proud of it thank you thank you councillor johnson is there any further discussion I was lucky enough to go to the prize um awarding the prize awards of this and they were amazing I know but that's incredible well but to see the girl that did all the pins individually that was amazing so hopefully it says it's ongoing so hopefully that there'll be a continual evolving um they're one of the juniors it was lovely because she was it was a lovely thing to have her one because I think we framed it for didn't we yeah that's right lovely thank you for sharing councillor barlow is there any further discussion councillor douglas I also want to speak in support of the motion and wanted to mention that at the recent landing lights wetland tour we were privileged to find out some amazing history about our first nations community here which I would love to see shared with the wider community I mean we have a statue for the first fleet but we don't have anything commemorating our first nations people and I really think we need to get that that address and so I was very excited to see that we do we are looking at um visual commemorations as well as a way finding signage in dual language which I'm also really excited about I know that in other communities they're really adopting the the right language for the right places and coming the right way and I think that it'll be a really improvement and build on the racism not welcome campaign to actually have that signage recognized for our came for botany bay thank you thank you council barlow and um there will be opportunities through the committees to um to promote a number of initiatives that um support events all right um right of reply council saronoski no all right although I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried this takes us to 7.11 this is the botany historical trust committee constitution amendment so there's an officer's recommendation before us do I have a do you wish to speak to the item no is there any discussion no discussion I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now move to 7.12 the selection of the new independent members of the risk and audit committee and if councillors had the opportunity um there there are some really good um that the cvs were very strong and some really good applicants there so there's an office's recommendation before us um move council morrissey seconded councillor barlow um council morrissey would you like to speak I think uh thank you madam may just to reiterate your words I'm sure councils have read the report and there's really high quality candidates who are now um coming externally into our organization to help us um as as as a member of the of that of that committee I'm really excited to see now we're in the second term of an amalgamated council there's still some ongoing challenges and to get a fresh set of eyes with a lot of life experience and experience across all really good support for our council body for for us as a group to hear their thoughts and ideas about how we can continuously improve thank you thank you councillor morrissey I'm a member of the committee I was for before but I just want to remind everyone that you're all welcome to go to it it is a committee that you should go to it is actually delving into something you wouldn't even it's quite incredible what happens and the amazing work the staff do to so I'm saying if you're not a member of the committee you can still attend which I might do and I might not but I'm not an official member thank you for the encouragement council balo um I will put uh sorry just a question madame just out of interest um the quality of these candidates is just incredible um I'm assuming that council pays these people they they do get remunerated for this don't they yeah there is a renumeration thank you thank you very much yes all right no further discussion all aye against I declare it carried that takes us to item 7.13 this is um a six monthly progress report on the delivery program and operational plan for 21.22 um councils would have had the opportunity to read through a range of projects that that are currently under underway is there a mover move council morrissey second councillor mcdougall council morrissey would you like to speak thank you thank you madam mayor the um it's such an extensive list and I think it's uh during the challenges we've had with uh with the the pandemic over recent years now a couple of years the the fact that some of these are still uh is there's some delays there and I think that that's acceptable but there's still a lot on the agenda and um in this term of council I think we should all look forward to a close relationship with directors who are driving these these things and I think the committee structure will also support that where we can really get down as a group and and know exactly what's going in the committees that I just found it a little bit with the the the green amber red structure a little bit um a little bit difficult and and if I'm looking through that amber is not necessarily a good a good thing uh if council is all uh if the team are still hitting all their milestones so um potentially we should be looking at if it's tracking green that as a council body if we're looking through pages and pages and pages of deliverables um if we're saying that everything's on track to be delivered in accordance with the plan potentially that should be green if it's a little bit behind we go to we go to amber and if it's way behind we go to red at the moment we're only seeing a few little green dots and just it's just oh okay there's a lot of amber there so probably just it's just feedback and we can I'm happy to discuss that that further it's just a little bit way as a body are tracking on plan for delivery my view is that they're green when they're delivered we can send up the fireworks or something I don't know but yeah if it's on track it should be green if it's off track it should be amber or red is is my view thank you thank you for your feedback council morrissey is there um any further speakers um counseling I don't seem to have I don't have a problem with it I mean there's so much on track and the council have been incredible with the difficulties they've had to have and over the last few months when everyone's had to have time off and we've all had the phone calls about our bins not being collected which isn't a council issue but we all still get the phone calls so I'm quite happy with the report the way it is thank you councillor douglas councillor fellow councillor douglas I just wanted to I am speaking in support of it I just wanted to mention that item 2.141 to council to consider street play initiatives most of you would have played on the street growing up I certainly did and people kids these days don't play on the street so only about 24 of kids get a chance to play on the street whereas when I grew up I was about 73 so it's a nice covered safe way for the community to get together and do these community play initiatives and there's a group called a thousand play streets so I'd love to see I know around my neighborhood there's a couple of very quiet streets there's quite strict conditions about which streets can be used they have to have a certain number of vehicle movements and whatnot but I'd love to see that embraced because I know that in our community strategic plan and in our reports from the last term you know safe streets is a really important thing that our community really wants to see in the area thank you no thank you councillor douglas um we'll make a note and I am familiar with that program put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried this takes us to um 7.14 this is the australian local government association so each year they hold a national general assembly and it is held in canberra but it seems to indicate that there may be an online opportunity potentially I guess it depends um so what this recommendation is um allows for any counsellor to nominate obviously um have it have some consideration for um have a look at the dates and see if that is possible if you um can't commit tonight there's still a little bit of time but we would have to do a group booking quite soon so I might take nominations from the floor um please put up your hand if you would like to nominate to go counselor morrissey councillor jansen no one else jumping at it ah counselor tsunas you like that um conference any others so well why don't you um so once we book um it's we've then got to pay so perhaps have a look um and let's say that they um let the gm know by the end of next week oh okay yeah well maybe we can always do if um closer to the date you can be a late entry if there's availability yeah all right um any um oh did I have a mover sorry do I have a mover for the motion move counselor hannah seconded counselor cedric any discussion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we have the final report which is 7.15 this was in relation to railway street rockdale in relation to proposed traffic calming treatments these were pulled out of the last agenda and there's a recommend are you moving the motion okay we have a mover do I have a second uh second account saranovsky um counselor soonis would you like to I i note that an on-site meeting was held with some councillors um there was some thought of putting a speed up or some sort of vehicle calming device further up the street but we'll examine that at a later date one thing I can do out of that ground was almost overrated you can hardly see it one and a half minutes but if you couldn't see it that needs to be I don't know it's a separation to this but I'm going to suggest when when staff go out I have a open vision of what's going on the 40 sign that was opposite the street on the street the 40 side which is this big was obliterated by the trees by the growth of the trees let's sort of when we go out and do site visits as a group to determine whether it needs a speed up it exists or it means that let's have a look at what's the brewery of the area and make adjustments and then say okay we still need to speed up we still need these fine we still need whatever it means to whatever it needs to be but in context of what's there and I'm just going to say to the director of city presentation through you there's two old bus seats there which is for the thank you thank you yes is there any further discussion all right no further discussion then um I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right that takes us to um the end of the reports um is there any um did you have uh yeah yeah can I is there a question with notice is that permitted now not an extraordinary non-extraordinary it's in relation to the flooding so I thought it was quite important that I asked the question yes you can put the question and it can be taken on notice thank you councilman so I just wanted an update there was a um there was a motion put to council on the 14th of april 2021 in relation to severe flooding we had throughout the lga at that point in time yesterday and the day before that has entirely been repeated and it doesn't seem as though anything has progressed while I understand that there are there's flash flooding and the drains can't cope and we get that but there's very specific hot spots about who is responsible for uh for the maintenance and the upgrades of those drains so the question is for the directors to review the modis emotion which was on the 14th I've got the reference number I'll email it across and ask for a report be tabled at the next appropriate committee from next month and that that report includes who's responsible uh for the maintenance repair of the stormwater drains thank you thank you councillor morrissey is there all right um we'll take that question on notice all right that then um brings us to the club we will now move into closed session and um to deal with item 7.7 so I thank the public for attending and I thank the public who was listening online today for joining us we will now be

can add as many as you want and uh let's see oh I'm gonna add another one down here too all right good hadley now we can add the leaves and eucalyptus leaves are really long well some of them are really long so let's draw some like long shapes coming off of each of the sticks that I'm gonna add them over here now you guys don't have to draw this exactly like us oh that's a big one he's really gonna like that one he's gonna be super hungry yeah that's gonna be his dinner and then we're gonna so you guys can add these leaves wherever you want on the little sticks coming out good you can even cover your whole page with eucalyptus branches and leaves but let to do one last thing what is it yeah we need to color it now this part we're going to fast forward but at the end you guys can pause it to match the same color you ready to fast forward yeah now on our koala we've added some some extra lines with our gray colored pencil we added a u-shape right here for the bottom of his mouth we added ovals on the bottom of his feet and we did a zigzag right here between his arms now we're going to leave these little spots white let's also draw a little outline on the ears so first we'll start here draw a curve that matches the top curve yeah and then let's do a zigzag that matches the outside and then that big curve that comes down now we're going to leave the inside of the ears white so that's why we're drawing this shape in there first so we can repeat that same shape over here so draw the top curve the zigzag and then the bottom curve yeah're right you're exactly right now we're going to continue to fast forward but we're going to leave the ears the mouth the belly and the ends of the feet white hadley go ahead and keep coloring I'm going to show our art friends how to add a little extra shading to our koala okay I'm using a black colored pencil I'm going to start really dark well I'm not pressing too hard because I don't want it to be too dark I'm going to press hard and then as I get away from the front legs I'm going to get lighter towards the end of this foot press lighter and lighter until it fades out so right there it looks darker and then out toward the end it's lighter so I'm going to repeat that same step over here press little harder towards his front leg and then as you get to the outside of his back leg press lighter and lighter and there's a little texture on on his leg so you can go back smooth out that texture I always love doing that it's one of my favorite things let's go back over with the same color and smooth it out that look nice and soft now yeah then you can also use this black on top of the brown on the eucalyptus plant and add a little shadow to make it look like it's more 3d these plants are going behind the koala is that cool with my white colored pencil I went over the black eyes and also the nose and added a highlight after usually in all of our other lessons we leave the white spot in there for the highlight but you can also add it after with a white colored pencil and one other thing I'm going to do is I went over the gray line and I made it softer softer with the white colored pencil I'm gonna do that with the ear so you can go over that hard line the white pencil and it will soften that line make it look even fluffier is that cool yes I love all these coloring your cute little koala did you have fun yes do you think it looks better all colored in yeah yeah I think so too I hope our friends are gonna pause the video right now to match the same color now we use a 50 cool gray for the fur on our quad we use pink on the cheeks we use sienna brown for the sticks and spring green for the leaves we hope you had a lot of fun drawing your koala yeah we do we hope you had a lot of fun and we'll see you later our friends hey parents and teachers did you know that we have an app now for a small monthly price you can get access to all of our lessons in a safe distraction-free environment just visit artforkidshub.tv to learn more here at first here we're gonna draw a wombat yeah bad we from australia yeah we hope you're going to follow along with us you need something to draw with we are going to use markers but you also need some paper and don't call with use whatever you have at your home or in your classroom you ready to start yeah let's first start by drawing our wombat's nose I'm going to start here in the middle of my paper and I'm going to draw an upside down u and we're going to start right about here in the middle of our paper yeah and then we could draw the nostrils let's draw a smaller upside down u's on each side and then let's connect those two with the curve in the middle there's our nose now let's try the mouth let's start here we'll draw a short line down and then I'm going to draw a little curve on each side u-shape on each side we could also give him little cheeks too him or her here we go I can also draw I'm going to draw a little curve underneath so the mouth is open and let's color in the mouth shape now anytime we go too fast or if we fast forward the video remember you guys now let's draw our wombats eyes I'm going to start over here and draw a circle on the left and the same size circle over here on the right for both eyes oh good job then let's also draw a smaller circle inside this is to make the eyes look shiny it's a little highlight and then we can color in the big circle but leave the little circle white all right now we're ready to draw the shape of his head we're going to start over here on the left and let's draw a big upside down u so I'm going to start on the left side of the left eye and end on the right side of the right eye yeah all right let's give a little furry cheeks so I'm going to draw three zigzags on the left and also over here on the right and then let's connect the two cheeks together with a curve for the bottom of his head now let's add the ears we'll draw a little upside down v right now let's draw a short line and then two little zigzags for the inside of the ear yeah and same thing over here small little line and then three little two little zigzags looks like a sideways w yeah we finished his head now let's draw his body I'm going to start over here on the left and we're going to draw a curve that comes down this is for his shoulder and then right below his head we could draw more little zigzags for his fur and then we'll draw the rest of his arm coming down further now on the right side let's start up higher on top of his head and we're going to draw a curve that comes down and connects to his ear this is for his back and we're going to imagine that going behind his ear and coming out the side and I'm gonna come down like this and then stop draw a couple zigzags for the fur and then draw the rest of his back leg coming down further now let's draw a curve it comes down and then we can draw more zigzags and then come down further austin do wombats like to climb in trees or dig under the ground dig under the ground yeah they like to dig and they got really strong claws so right here on the left side let's draw a zigzag line we're gonna go down back up now we're gonna do three more of those two three four so that we have a total of four and then on the top of each claw let's connect with an upside down u there's his claws he looks really cool let's repeat that same step for his right arm we're gonna draw zigzag down back up and then four with three more to make four two three four yeah and then we can draw the top of the claws upside down use all right good job and then we can draw let's draw a short line that comes up and let's draw a short line that comes up over here too then we're going to to start here and draw a zigzag line that comes under and connects to the other side now let's finish his back leg over here we're going to draw more claws so I'm going to draw another zigzag down back up and then we're going to run into his other arm so if you don't have room to draw all four that's okay or you can fit him in just like that I only had room for three so we'll connect the top to finish the claws on my drawing I have a little more space in between his front two legs yours is closer together so you can leave this next step off but he has one two front legs yeah four hands and then he has two back legs and one over here and I'm gonna draw his other one over here so I'm gonna draw more claws I'm gonna go down back up like that and do one more and then I'm gonna connect the top and they're just barely underneath his belly so part is sticking out the bottom and you can leave yours off I think it looks perfect just like that yeah now we still need to do one more thing what is it color it yeah we need to color our wombats are gonna look so much cooler all colored in now this part we are gonna fast forward but at the end remember you guys can pause the video again to match the same color you ready to fast forward yeah now we only use two colors to color our wombat we use the light brown and a dark brown to use the dark brown for his nose and also his claws he looks really cool but do you know what would make this drawing even cooler if you add a background yeah you should add a background you can maybe even draw him coming out of one of his tunnels yeah you could also draw a family of wombats maybe you could draw another one and also a baby wombat yeah do you know that these are marsupials and they actually have their little pouch backwards and that's dirt inside of the pouch where the baby is upside hmm we had a lot of fun drawing your wall back yeah we do we hope you had a lot of fun we'll see you later our friends goodbye disco time goodbye good times gets me good times I just can't control my fears times so uh

So now it's my pleasure to introduce judy mundy who's joined us today um judy was born in sydney and educated at east lakes and mascot public schools mascot public schools just across the road from the library she was also educated at st george girls high school she later completed an arts degree and a law degree at macquarie university and in 1965 she married jack mundy judy was the first female president of the communist party of australia from 1979 to 1982 and she stood as a candidate for the communist party of australia in the 1967 and 1968 elections for the new south wales lower house in the seat of philip and in the 1980 federal house of representatives election for the seat of sydney she was also one of a group of women who established the women's liberation movement in australia in 1969. so judy welcome back to mascot thank you alison the suburb of your childhood yes it was yes but until I was till I was nearly 10 and then we moved but I continued at mascot um primary school and st george which was closer to where I was then living yes so I'd like to start today's interview by asking you how you met jack and what sort of person he was oh I met jack was one of those chance things I was I went to university later in life but I started off working in an office and I got a job with the builders labourers federation and I met jack there he was involved in the union was a union member and frequently came into the union office what sort of a person was he he was he was highly intelligent um very well read interested in the arts had a very good sense of humor and a feeling for humanity and for what sort of world it ought to be um so I found him pretty interesting so you just got chatting over the tea and coffee urn or well he late he became an organiser of the union and so he was frequently in the union office and I was working there um and so we began talking and then he started I was at a union function the staff often went to union functions and assisted in one way or another I went to one and he was kind enough to take me home and so after that I said oh alright I would go out with him and he took me to the ballet and I was very impressed with that I would be impressed too if someone took the team yes and then asked me to get married that night which I thought was probably a bit premature given it was the first time we'd actually been out but I'd worked I mean I'd known him for some time by then but anyway we did end up getting married and you had over 50 years together I think 55 yeah so you both appear to be fairly socially conscious people with a passion for fairness and justice and equality and I know that you studied arts and law at university which would have heightened your social awareness but jack came to sydney in 1949 to play rugby league so what do you think fostered his commitment jack came from a progressive family he was one of five children they were all very bright actually and great conversationalists they pots of tea were the thing in those days and they'd sit drinking tea when I met some of them and they'd discuss everything but his father was pretty progressive and uh so I i think they had an interest in people he came from he he grew up I was born and grew up on the atherton tableland in far north queensland which is a very beautiful part of australia and he came to sydney to play football but when he was playing football in those days he was made an offer with the parramatta club and came down to play for parramatta so he really was just interested in sports at that time mainly interested in sports but you needed to work during the week it's not like now where people paid lots of money for playing football although when he became captain coach a couple of teams and took them to premierships in both cases you were paid something but he needed jobs he he ended up all that he got at that time he worked in a couple of other places first and then he became a builders labourer so I think at that stage he probably saw it as something to fill in time between football matches but when he went into the building industry he found that it was the conditions were very poor and the safety was almost non-existent and it was an unfortunate feature of life in that industry that people were killed on the job jack became part he joined the union became part of the rank-and-file organisation of the union there was a corrupt union leadership at that time it was interested in keeping themselves in power and so they they would let employers know if it was one of these people from the rank and file organisation and they'd frequently be sacked but they persisted they formed this terrific rank-and-file organization which eventually won the leadership of the union and it was during that and of course they they became the leadership on a policy of doing something about improving the wages the and so of course he became much more aware about all of those sorts of issues in that struggle to to um improve the union and to get rid of the old leadership and you asked me before how I met him what happened was when the the old leadership of the union was defeated at the election and the new people came in the then office staff walked out on mass and they didn't want to work with these new radical people and um so I knew somebody who worked in the trades hall and that was and I was really interested in getting a new job and so that's how I came to work in the union office at that time and to meet jack yes yes oh that's great he he was still very interested in sports he had an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket and cricketing scores which impressed me but it would have been easy because I knew nothing about africa but I certainly learned something about it being being with jack yeah and was very impressed that somebody could remember all of I think cricket lovers would be like that yeah I think you're right yes um so back to the stomping ground of your childhood and specifically to east lakes which is the subject of our exhibition here east lakes was the second green band but the first started across the harbour in the upper class suburb of hunters hill uh so just a bit of background for people that aren't um familiar with uh the hunters hills protest in 1971 a group of well-heeled women were fighting to save a small patch of land which was known as kelly's bush from development by av jennings so I imagine it must have been quite a surprise for jack who was also a member of the communist party of australia and a builders laborer and in that time maybe secretary of the union to get a call from an upper middle class matron from the lower north shore asking for help from the blf um can you recall that occasion I know it was over 50 years ago and what happened well it became very much part of our good friends with the third they became known as the bachelors for kelly's bush there were 13 women lovely people and they wrote to the union they tried everything to save this bushland on the parrot last remaining bush land on the paramedic river it had been open space always that bit of land and then there was a proposal to build on it to develop it like it's happening with so much of the rest of sydney ever since then actually I was going to say now but ever since then and so they wanted to save that bushland they tried all of the conventional means without success so they then wrote to the union movement and the guild of slavery as well and one of the union people bob pringle went out to find out what it was all about came back and reported jack was secretary of the union who reported to the executive there was some debate over whether they ought to help them but the women came in and talked to them and said what they tried to do and there was some action given that it was in a part of sydney where no builder slaveries lived um and uh but jack's view and and it became the view of the union was that that we ought to be doing something about extending parklands and open spaces for people in sydney and that people who lived in an area ought to have the right to have some say over what happened in their area without other people dictating and taking up every bit of available space and so the union made a decision that it would support the women and at that time of course it was called a black band and so they put a black ban on any building work going on they had a fair bit of power because the developer proposed developer had other building sites in sydney and the union said well don't touch this land otherwise building work will stop on your other projects and the developer decided not to go ahead so the women won the battle and that was 50 years ago and um and that land still remains open bushland on was well it was notorious here are a bunch of builders laborers deciding that this development wasn't going ahead the union was inundated in the end with requests from people but the second one I'm pleased to say was at east lakes there was a block of land surrounded by that time by buildings they the developer had said that this section of land would remain open space open reserve for the people next thing building materials were moved on to that land people got together they went to the builders labour's union and said well you helped those people what about helping us to preserve this land that land was eventually saved it was quite took quite some time but it was saved because they put a black ban on it uh and it became known as east lakes reserve and I'm really pleased to say that a bit of history has been recognized with the change of name from these states reserved to jack mundy reserve and so that was how that happened the name the name was then changed to green ban that because black bands were always something that were used by industrial workers to try to improve um their wages or working conditions or for safety issues or things that would benefit themselves and this was something that not only did it not benefit them at all because nobody none of them lived at hunters hill when the first one was on um but um it was important they felt to do something about it and so they they did but it was to save the environment and so they felt that a green band much more described what the union was doing absolutely and I and it um it's a really fitting terminology for it and I just want to um come back to um I guess why um the blf decided that it was important to support these um protests from from local people because in the past workers have gone on strike as a way of agitating for better wages and working conditions and in a sense by opposing these building projects um which were to be on what was promised as parkland they were ostensibly imposing do you think motivated the members of the blf to withdraw their labour and to provide support to these green bands look a couple of things I'll come back to the support for the leadership of the union's membership but in the meantime allison you've reminded me about jack's comments I mean jacob spoke and by that time he was a very well-known union leader and one of the things you've kindly reminded me by printing this out but yeah I'll just say what it was and this was the sort of thing that jack had been saying which prompted the women from kelly's bush to go to the union and say well you've said these things what about putting your money where your mouth is virtually and this is one of the things that jack was reported in the sydney morning herald as saying yes we want to build however we prefer to build urgently required hospitals schools other public utilities high quality flats units and houses provided they're designed with adequate concern for the environment than to build ugly we want all our members employed it will not just become robots directed by developer builders who value the dollar at the expense of the environment more and more we're going to determine which buildings we will build the environmental interests of three million people as they were as we were in sydney at that time are at stake and cannot be left to developers and building employers whose main concern is making profit progressive unions like ours therefore have a very useful social role to play in the citizens interest and we intend to play it so that was the sort of statement that jack had been making and these women came to them now why did the members support the leadership when they made this decision the members also made the decision they were very democratically run union they came in on a policy of improving wages and conditions they were very successful at doing this the wages went out the conditions improved that the safety was was a major issue safety officers were elected on all of the jobs but the union members also came to the members came and they'd raised the issues with these sorts of issues with them and discuss it now they they weren't always immediately successful just just as an example the union also saved the theater oil in sydney and when what happened was there was a big new development going up where the theater oil theater had existed on that side almost continuously since the late 1800s it was going to come down there was a big new development going up the theater would be no theater there the the theater community approached the union as did people from all over the state and then further afield um so the theater community approached the union and said will you help us to save we need to save this and the union members didn't immediately agree with that they did save it the the developer was a very progressive developer called dick dusseldorf and he came back from overseas and spoke with the union and in the end what happened was they he agreed that a theater would be incorporated because he wasn't to save the a theater on that land so they were building the mlc center dusseldorf agreed that a theater should be incorporated into that building and harry saga wasn't all that happy at first to but did it and did it within a fortnight they changed that and and and came out with a new proposal that would incorporate a new theater into that building but the members weren't all that enamored at first and so what they did was got people from the theater community to come and address the union members about why keeping live theatres in sydney was an advantage to all of the people of sydney so that was how that one was won so it because it was democratically run because of the huge successes in improving things for the people on the job the workers and by the way when I said democratically run that meant that the union officials wages were tied to those of the workers on the job excuse me there was no high pay for union efficiency when a strike was on the officials weren't paid either they worked because they got the same as the they're in the same situation as the workers so it was because of that I think that the members were prepared to go along with proposals for the union leadership about why if they ought to engage in this sort of activity so I'll let you grab a drink of water if you need one for your throat oh thank you um but um you know it does sound like the the union leaders had won the respect of the union members and that the members felt included in the decisions that were being made about where their labour would be would be used uh yes that's right I think they did win enormous respect I think well their lives have been improved so much for the better and they and the union did things like there were a lot of of um migrant workers in the building industry so the union made sure that there were interpreters at all of the union meetings so that you had this group of people who could interpret in various languages and quite um what should I say you know um it's a path for the course today but um 50 years ago that was quite innovative I'd say and there weren't that many um interpreters provided in in public settings um yes yeah because the union was was I think well someone described it as the most radical and innovative union the world has ever seen because they also use their industrial power uh for social good in in other ways as well so that when the garinges went on strike at wave hill in the northern territory they at the time were still being paid rations if you can believe it they were being paid rations for the work that they did so they went on strike and the union brought me a couple of people two people from the garinges down to sydney and took them all around the jobs to discuss to let workers know what was happening in the northern territory and about to why that they were still being paid in rations and and so workers were very supportive of what was happening so that was an instance of where the union took up a struggle on behalf of other people um and uh and that people in sydney know what was going on in the northern territory and that's um an aspect of the history of the blf or the new south wales um blf that has sprung out of the green bands um that they went on to support um other um causes like um the vietnam war protests and the protests against the springbok um south african tour and then um women's liberation causes um uh lesbian and gay rights so really thinking outside of their their own backyard of sydney their own room that's exactly right um on the well on gay rights that came about because the I'll just go back a little bit just an interesting little story you might be interested in when the theater royal issue was won and the first night of the theater and so there was some concern that the usual theater crowd mightn't be very happy with communist jack going to the first night and so fine person asked jack if he would go with him on the first night to the theater as his partner to go and so it's interesting I mean the theater was saved but but they were worried that some of the theater the first night crowd might not be very happy with somebody like the person who saved the theater um being invited but anyway back to gay rights long before the rest of australia caught up there was a student at macquarie university who lived in student housing he was expelled from that housing because he was gay and so the gay movement which had started to gain a bit of strength came to the union and asked whether they would help whether the union would help them the union had a fair bit of power because there was a fair bit of building work going on at macquarie university at the time and so they again the usual had a meeting um discussed why this was important why people shouldn't be kicked out of university housing because they happen to have a certain sexuality and so they put a ban on any further building going on at the university until that student was restored to university housing the university caved in the student was restored and the building work went ahead but yes that was an example of the union using its industrial muscle to do something about a social ill and we've been fortunate to be able to borrow a large part of an exhibition that the trades hall council put together on the green bands and that's part of the exhibition at mascot library which is open for everybody to come and see um monday to friday 10 a.m till 6 pm and it's free um so as well as some focusing on the east lakes green band which is just down the road east lakes and now my new reserve just down the road um there's also that tells the wider story of the um political force that um the new south wales blf came to be so I'm sorry judy so well I was only going to say with something like the springbok tour you know when apartheid still existed in south africa uh a lot of people in australia were very opposed to that the union discussed those sorts of issues as well and yes a lot of them were involved in the anti-apartheid struggle in australia which as you know ended with um with a change in south africa nelson mandela was freed um and and so that was another struggle that that many of the union members the union didn't take action itself about that but many of the union members were involved in that anti-apartheid's job and and on the women's issue um no women worked in the building industry at that time but women were saying why shouldn't we be able to have jobs in the in the building industry I mean some of the jobs are heavy but of course a lot of men wouldn't want to do those jobs either and there are a lot of jobs probably some of the more skilled ones that could have been done by women and so the union assisted women to work in in that case not walk'm not sure that all union members were totally um in agreement but anyway they discussed it and said well yes alright if they can do the job they ought to be able to do it and I remember one woman who got those jobs jan reed was she said she'd never earned that much money in her life because of course women worked in in highly skilled jobs but were paid less often because they were women and in that they insisted one rate for the job the union and so the women were paid at high rates and um and so of course they were being paid more than they've been getting in probably quite skilled jobs in other areas another innovation okay well one rate for the job yeah yeah yes yeah so um you mentioned before that um after kelly's bush um the union was inundated with requests for support for other um local groups that wanted to save either parkland or heritage-listed buildings and I'm just imagining that the early 1970s when um the new south wales blf was supporting over and up and north to newcastle and you had your own career and and jack was um being pulled in all sorts of directions it just strikes me as being quite a turbulent very busy time can you remember back then what was it like it was pretty exciting yes yes you were changing the world um there was so many green bands that's right and some of them were like the pitt street congregational church as the thing was which still exists because of the green bay by the builders libraries but the church community came to the union and asked them in the way that I've explained before about the theater community the church community asked the union to save that building which it was um and there were others like centennial park yeah where it was proposed to build a sports stadium on centennial park and um in the hope of getting a forthcoming uh olympic games and uh so centennial park was saved from being intruded upon with all sorts of buildings and swimming pools I think they took up jack's suggestion and yes you could say that that was a place where that ought to be looked at yes that's right um and so there were many I mean some of the bands were to save like expressways going through suburbs through a whole suburb so a band was put on on an expert you know expressways like leave and so on and so so some of them were um very big areas and of course there was the rocks which is probably the best known one but it was the oldest part of european australia and uh and there was a proposal to build high-rise all over the rocks would certainly would be a tourist draw card if that had been the case that was that was really more about the rights of the local residents at the time because many of the people who lived in that area had been there since the beginning of white australia and generations of them had lived there and they were going to be turfed out of their homes and so they asked the union for assistance but really it was to preserve um that was but then of course it became about the the history of the area the fact that he had heritage that was all going to be just destroyed and so again the union stepped in and and in fact that was how come the serious building was built because um after well the rand government was elected and meantime they'd been successful about preserving the rocks area but there was a fair bit of displacement of people and so the iran government agreed to build a purpose-built public housing building that could house some of these a lot of these people who were displaced by what had taken place in in the rocks and although that general area was saved so the serious building was built and that was the purpose-built public housing building of over 70 units that ranged in size from four bedroom to single bedroom one bedroom and um and some smaller units and so all of those working test people families and moved in to that building and so that's why that and that's why there was a struggle to save part in I mean he was still fighting a good fight um until just not long before or till he died really and and so that building was saved but unfortunately the government sold it off it's almost as though that building has harbor views looks out over the opera house in sydney harbour and it was almost as though it was too good for working-class people and so they've now sold that off and they talk about public housing but clearly not not public housing in a salubrious era looking area that looks out over sydney harbour and so the building's been taken back from it is no longer public housing but the building itself has been saved and stands as a monument really to that union's activities absolutely yes yes so it was you asked about the effect of course of course alison there were a lot of threats at that time and some of them were very scary it was not all um you know not all happy because uh there were quite a lot of threats against the family and sometimes that jack too much but you know when michael and I were home by ourselves and you've got phone calls late at night and so on it could be quite threatening and at times the police would contact us and say oh that's been you know a bomb threat we need to come and have a look at the place and things like that happened in fact one night we were at a restaurant and a phone call came to the restaurant to say that the people knew we were there and that sort of thing happened but but look it was very exciting a great number of things were achieved and we were yeah we nobody did come and do anything I think was probably one of the advantages jack used to say at least have been very well known it would have been difficult for um for them to do anything for developers to do anything and it's a pity that there there isn't that sort of union strength at the present time because some of the disgraceful developments that have taken place in sydney so bad that that developers have gotten away with building a building like that people have paid good money to buy somewhere for themselves to live and and it's unlivable and that's what happens when uh regulations are lifted to the point that it's open slather developers can get away with it well at that time it wasn't just easy for them yes and we are nearly at time and I wanted to allow a bit of time at the end for your questions from from the audience but just one final question to wrap up judy um so we're in 2022 now and looking back on the green bands from 50 years ago it was an amazing remarkably successful social movement that in one sense seemed to rise out of nowhere but really was a response to the rapid urban development and the greed of developers and the liberal government that at that time allowed that to happen but 50 years on we've got high-rise residential towers like mascot towers shooting up around sydney around east lakes as well today and I kind um do you have any thoughts about that you've mentioned that unions aren't as strong today as they were in the 1970s they're a great deal more restricted of course there were restrictions uh in the 1960s and so on as well but um and and in fact unions could be fined and leaders of unions jailed for taking actions that were deemed uh unlawful at that time but what happened was a union leader called clario shea actually did go to jail because the union was on strike and and massive numb millions of workers in australia stopped to work to demonstrate again when clary o'shea was put in jail so workers stopped work and that changed the laws so for a long time that so the builders labourers were able to do what they did but laws have been reintroduced that prevent unions from doing very much and really people would be a great deal better off if the union movement was was as strong as it was then or certainly stronger than it is now a lot of unions are fighting for people landscape has changed significantly I think since well it makes it much more difficult for that and maybe something like the clary o'shea situation might have to happen again indeed um so I'm just looking at a laptop on my lap uh to see what um if there are any questions um for you judy and um there is one here from patricia curthois um who says it's um wonderful to hear your involvement in the movement judy um how long did jack did she you've got patricia's written how long did judy continue to work for the union um before you went on to other things oh well jack wanted to get married and so what we did get married um but I left as soon as when we were going to get married I left I thought you can't_''_2112.16 be working with other staff and have that sort of relationship with the person who was an organiser at that time and became secretary after that so I left and went to work elsewhere and then later on I went to university and and then I went to the bar and worked as a barrister from then on so but of course you you know you're together you know what's going on as soon as I used to talk to him about some of the things I was involved in you know well I could hardly miss out could I on what was going on with him because there was a great deal of media coverage I mean the premier of the state at the time um would say things like who do they think they are they're mere builders labels they think they'll tell planets and so there's a lot a great deal of media coverage at that time so no of course I was involved but I left as soon as we got married yes okay um just while we wait to see if any other questions come through I'll just mention another bit of green band's wider history that you might like to comment on judy um but I was reading that it was when I think her name was petra kelly from was and she saw what was happening with the green bands um as she kind of took that idea of a social movement protecting green spaces back with her to um germany and um established the first greens party and so the the greens as a political movement that we know of today had its roots in the green bands in sydney as well is that that's true ellis and yes she did she came well the green bands um got some international publicity not just in australia and she read about it and she came to australia and um well there was a meeting at the trades hall actually she attended that but anyway we had dinner she came out here more than once and um and she then struck upon the name the greens arising out of the green bands and so when she went back to germany she proposed this name and that's where the the name comes from and um so we met we were lucky enough to meet petra kelly uh each time she came to australia um she was yes a wonderful savers of heritage because the union had a great deal to do with the national trust I mean whereas people like then premier ask and sneered at the build of sabres the national trust certainly didn't they thought it was wonderful to have this organisation that was capable of doing what the trust itself wasn't able to always do that is preserve uh buildings and so jack and john morris of the national trust at that time developed a close relationship and jack would contact john and ask when they had all these requests to say but what do you think you know and so the national trust where advisors became advisers to the builders libraries about what buildings should be so yes it was um it was a pretty interesting and exciting time that went on for a long time and after jake stepped down from the union he was invited to speak to conferences in many countries in the world and and of course the green bands went further than sydney um not just newcastle but western australia and uh tasmania and victoria of course and as well there was an old post office in london that they were that was in birmingham actually and what happened was we were in england I was in england with jack at that time he was lecturing at the london school of environmental studies and and um there was an australian in london and he he got in touch and said look spark milligan would like to meet you there's this building in birmingham that he reckons ought to be safe because milligan used to come to australia because his mother lived here at roy and he used to come out and visit so he knew about the green bands because of that so we had dinner with spike milligan and he said he wanted could jack come and have a look at this post office in the marvelous marvelous building in birmingham that was to come down uh and so jack spoke with the bloke called pete carter who was the head of the secretary of the building union in england at that time in that part of england and so they met and a green band the sorts of things they've been able to achieve in australia and the birmingham post office is still there today so yeah that's fantastic yes and perhaps that's a good news story to end on to to think about the something a grassroots movement that started in sydney that had international um implications and um brought good news to the people of from the people of birmingham um to the people of the east lake um what a connection hey yes um and so we're very pleased to have the jack mundy reserve in east lakes it's looking pretty beautiful at the moment with all the rain that we've had I cannot imagine that space without that park because it is quite um you know dense residential area so um my thanks on behalf of everybody to judy mundy for travelling today and coming to talk to us about pleasure thank you so much for talking to us about um jack mundy and the legacy of the new south wales blf and the green bands I hope that you'll be able to make at mascot library which has been extended until the 31st of march so we'd love to welcome you into mascot library and look out for information about next month's flashback friday talk where we will be going to one cliff to the southern end of the bayside council lga and leone bell who won the ron rathbone local history prize last year will talk to us about the very interesting history and reincarnations of dipito an old house in vancliff so thank you everybody for joining us thank you judy for coming and have a good afternoon bye for now

council owada and councillor tsunas are there is there any discussion all those in favor say aye against declare it I declare the minutes confirmed I now move on to item six on the agenda which are the merrell minutes so there are three merrell minutes tonight so the first merrell minute is known as is called the key resilience projects and initiatives and I thought this was a really good opportunity particularly as we have a number of new councillors and in the last term of council there was a lot of work done in relation to different initiatives that were occurring at council so it's quite it's a very comprehensive report and you can see that there's a number of programs which are delivering a range of environmental initiatives so although it's not a complete list it's certainly a at bayside council to minimize a number of things such as energy use improving tree canopy and increasing the collection and reuse of recycled materials so so we've got um some of you may be aware of the awards as well that council received a couple of weeks ago in relation to waste so there's um some really good things happening here and and this certainly um gives us a very good overview of different things so I i will take it as read um but a good opportunity and I encourage the public um who are listening as well to um have a have a look at all the great things that are happening at bayside I move that the merrell minute be adopted thank you councillor so that um is there any discussion on the merrell minute councillor janssen thank you madam mayor um just to let you know I'm supportive of your merrell minute and I want to commend officers on the work that has been undertaken and continues to be undertaken by council to address climate change and I note that this work prepared action outlined in theme three of the community strategic plan which is council's highest level plan on behalf of the community I also note that a new community strategic plan is currently being prepared and that the community are being asked for their import and I encourage all community to provide input on this plan particularly in relation to these climate change actions thank you thank you council jackson and thank you for reminding the community too that we do have that consultation out at the moment and encourage everyone to participate and shortly we will be holding a consultation with ward councillors in each ward so that community can come and contribute and share their their ideas all right are there any other speakers um dan thank you thank you madam mayor for moving this mayoral minute I think it's fantastic to look at all the work bayside council's doing I'd just like to particularly highlight the work ss rock has done just a few years ago we really didn't have a renewable energy plan and by mid next year we will be they're doing fantastic work um they represent about so um about half the economic output of sydney um and it's going to make a real difference um the work that they're doing not just here but across across sydney thank you councilman dougal yes that's I'm glad you pointed that out thank you I'm councillor madam chair so at the end of the day council is limited in what it can do but what it is doing it's fantastic in the area of waste management it's at the forefront of many many other councils in australia um in terms of being of the good corporate citizen and using recyclables renewables and so on I think we're at the forefront and that's and that's what the message we have to give as the council to say this is how we do it this is what needs to be done in terms of improving the green space fair enough we can do that but we've got to manage people throwing asbestos into the ground as well so we've got work to do because the community some are very good some do not listen whatsoever so it's a hard task for this council and all as are all councils and other government agencies but we lead by example and I think in the era of waste we're doing a fantastic work in the area of the way we tender we're doing fantastic working looking for the best the best renewable the best cutting edge option and this is what the council's been doing the past few years and it's fantastic recommend the motion thank you councillor soonis councillor hannah I just had a thought which could be dangerous but I'm just wondering uh how much of this is actually known by the residents now I remember some years ago in the bayside news some councillor came up with a very good idea about a little thing called did you know and I'm just wondering whether some of this stuff may be a good idea to actually put in that did you know just to start to get it out there to the residents areas I'm not suggesting you bombard them but there's some interesting stuff there I'm sure they'd like to know about um and even even in relation to what happens with the contents of the red bin for example there's still a lot of confusion out there about that so all those sorts of things I think could possibly be sorted out and there's a hell of a lot of information there that you might be able to draw on so just a suggestion no thank you thank you madame thank you councillor hannah for that suggestion I think you make a very good point because council we do so many wonderful things and and it is about letting people know so um thank you for that suggestion any other speakers okay there being no further discussion I put the motion all those in favor say aye against I declare the motion carried I now move on to a supplementary merrell minute which was emailed to counsellors today and this is in response to the smart camera trial being expanded and some of you would that council has gained for really being um ahead in smart technology in this particular area so what this merrell minute is about the progress that's being made to combat hooning and antisocial behavior in and around brighton-lessons particularly so council began a serious anti-hooning campaign has it's been a focus for a number of years but began a serious campaign last year following a number of representations from councillors and also our local member for rockdale mr steve camper on behalf of the community and constituents and I i do want to take this opportunity to person to acknowledge the efforts and commitment of several councillors our two former mayors councillor saronoski and councillor awada as well as councillor mcdougall and in particular thank and acknowledge the former deputy mayor and former councillor james mcdonald for his advocacy over a long period of time and former councillor vicky paulos so it's important that councillors are aware and particularly new councillors as returning councillors would know that james mcduck former james former councillor james mcdonald introduced several notices of motion over a period of time on this on behalf of their local community as did counsellor and cons councillor mcdougall so on behalf of the community I want to thank and I know this is a a very challenging topic and and I acknowledge um the community that that are impacted but on behalf of the community I'd also like to thank the member for rockdale mr steve campbell and the local area police command for their support and assistance because this doesn't happen unless people work together in order to achieve the outcome so just to um for the purposes of uh council and those people listening that council recently installed seven multi-directional cameras on grand parade bay street and travalga street frightenly sans following and following the success of this smart technology being used it being trialled in banston parade to identify and bring to justice those responsible for hooning and antisocial behaviors so the technology has actually been recognized as a world first and bayside council is at the forefront of using this technology to combat antisocial behavior so council I i won't read the whole um motion but it's's license plate plate recognition and um which was um particularly over the 2021 summer for sure as part of that program and with um there's there's a lot of opportunity with the particular technology to expand it and increase increase the trials so and and that's something that's important that um council will continue to work with and moving forward while council continue to introduce additional measures to curb anti-social behaviour the role of the state government is paramount in this I'm therefore recommending that the member for rockdale mr steve camper be asked to assume the leadership of that anti-hooning working party with representation from the community council and all local state members and the police so it is by working together that solutions are formed and so I'm pleased to advise that mr camper has confirmed his availability and commitment to taking on this challenge I move that the merrell minute be adopted thank you speak on on this item I congratulate you and the staff for an excellent report but I need to also um is to say a few the driving force of this whole smart camera particularly down benson parade I must also acknowledge bill ashton and the residents of manson parade for their commitment and ongoing information they supplied to the police and persistence on it you're right this is an opportunity where the council police and the residents got together to try and solve an ongoing issue that we've got down in just around that area in advance to play but it's not just advanced and prey it's unfortunately a number of spot uh spots around our city so I just wanted as I said thank you for the merrill minute acknowledge the fine work that um council mcdonald's uh former council mcdonald and the other councils that you've said put in the report um mr campbell is very our local member is very committed a few months ago he did a petition and sit in his office when parliament sits he will do a presentation and present it to uh parliament or in relation to antisocial behavior right across our city so that once again I want to thank saranovsky councillor cedric uh thank you madam mayor I too stand in support of your um motion I want to thank you for putting this forward and um similar to councillor savonowski I want to thank uh councilman mcdonald for his hard work in this um the general manager I know has been part of this plus the award councillors and in particular the residents it looks like a lot of people are trying to claim credit for this I think the previous council the previous council is the one that put this forward and councillor mcdonald and it's great that you've recognized that um and I want to thank the current councillors uh for pushing this forward especially the ward five councillors um councillor douglas and councillor um mcdougall and myself the the the the key issue for me uh madame is um the working group and I think this is a great initiative that you've brought forward all councillors here whether it be one three one thing or another we all want to stop anti-hooning we all want to stop the anti-social behavior and we think if we have a united approach um I've received numerous uh phone calls from ward 5 residents I've been bombarded different streets similar issues and I think we also need to take into consideration that according to councillor safranoski this issue's been around from the 90s and council has been working on this and they've done a good job and I think this is only going to really really push forward the unified approach so I think having a holistic approach using state police and the community whether it be traffic calming or cameras the working group is a marvellous idea and I wholeheartedly support it and I want to thank you again thank you councillor cedric are there any other speakers thank you madam mayor I'll be as brief as possible I commend you for this uh meryl minute you have uh described it very well and and I too acknowledge uh the former councillor james mcdonald's he was one of the councillors on the uh on the foot front forefront calling for uh dealing with hurning and hooning has been since the worst week and council I commend the whole council and staff and former councillors and president council is dealing with hurning throughout the process uh I'll be honest we won't be able to stop it hundred percent but we could deal with it to make it as less as possible and hopefully the team that working team that with mr camper leading the way will bring further results and put more pressure on the state government because it is a state government real issue and having the police presence a lot of police president hopefully that will alleviate some of the hooning issues there thank you thank you councillor naji do we have any other speakers there being no oh sorry councilman mcdougall thank you madam mayor for bringing this motion to council and for your kind words obviously this is something that that my former ward colleagues councillors paul loss and councillor mcdonald fought hard on alongside me and I'd like to acknowledge all their work and particularly council mcdonald who was very passionate about these lpr cameras and I know I was very pleased I do I do think they will make a difference I also think this is a as we're on a new term of council and there's been some reset in the state government it's time to renew our efforts to lobby the state to support us where we need them to to end some of these problems there's a new police minister there's a new roads minister we were told no again and again unfortunately where we needed help on things like speed cameras on police presence on all of these things um there are new people in those offices and we need to try and get them on board again to solve some of these problems but I commend the motion and thank you to all the councillors who have continued to support um bayside's efforts to try and combat honing to the extent we can thank you council mcdougall there any other speakers there being no further discussion I put the motion on the screen all those in favor say aye against I declare the motion carried I now move to an it relates to a potential land acquisition so therefore it is proposed that the matter including the confidential attachment mentioned in my merrill minute be considered enclosed council meeting with the press and public excluded once all other items have been dealt with at the end of the meeting tonight I moved that council consider this report and the contents of the confidential attachment in closed council meeting after having dealt with all other items on the business paper with the press and public excluded for the reason noted above all those in favor say um soon as gent moved by councillor tunis seconded by councillor janssen all those in favor say aye against declare it carried all right we will now move to the public forum so members of the public who have applied to speak at the meeting will now be invited to address the meeting so we have 12 speakers tonight dealing with seven items in total the time limit for each speaker is based on how many speakers have registered for the item so speakers are advised that a warning bill will sound when only one the meeting by the teams app are to have their video off and microphone muted until I invite you to speak speakers will be removed from teams once the item has concluded you can then watch the remainder of the meeting on bayside's council's youtube page for those speakers who are joining the meeting by phone please use the asterix button and the number six on your phone's keypad to mute and unmute your phone if you registered a written submission these have been provided to counsellors prior to the meeting speakers are reminded to keep communication factual polite and professional and to use appropriate language and tone do not use any defamatory or derogatory remarks as defamation laws apply to address in public forum so depending on as per our code of meeting their um residents if there are two or less speakers they will each have the opportunity to speak for five minutes if there are more than two speakers to the one item they will have three minutes to speak and I ask that each speaker avoid repeating what's already been said but to councillor's attention please the first item that we have for public speaking it is item 5.2 which is the paid parking residential precinct of item 9.1 so it's part of the minutes of the brighton la sands working party meeting which met on the 20th of october 2021 so it is an item within oh again 5.2 um sorry if any councillors so 5.2 is now yeah all right so we have um we have two people registered to address the meeting so I i note that our manager of governance and risk will phone each speaker and I now invite mr el hajj who is an affected resident speaking against the officer recommendation the councillors will just wait as uh mr el hajj mr el hajj are you on are you there yep hello yes hello welcome to the meeting tonight I now invite you to speak to the item hello can you hear me there if you could just put get a little bit closer to your microphone and and just speak slowly please so that all counsellors can pick up what you're saying minute or a five minute time friend I'll have sorry ah sorry um there are sorry no I couldn't I can't hear you very well from up here um so there are two speakers to this item so if you haven't you will have five minutes okay so um I'm aware that for this particular item the constituents have um put forward to their council counselors concerns over parking and you know people who have been parking permanently in the area um and need to have a rotation of cars and so the introduction introduction of paid parking is perhaps one solution that's being considered and my thoughts on that is whilst I agree with the need for addressing this issue um I wonder if it can be addressed while also factoring in the cost they will come to to residents within bayside and also to the general public um I'm aware I've been you know I i think it was told license plate readers may be installed I wonder how many of those might be considered the costs involved for each I was you know if I was to think of the people who may be parking permanently in certain areas uh would they not just go and park on the grand parade and park permanently on there where there will be no time parking so then I think to myself well is it possible to explore um just timed parking like maruba does you know four hour free parking or perhaps something less um you know sometimes after work I live within walking distance to the beach but if I sometimes have to work on to go past for a drive stop for a coffee and maybe meet a friend or go to the beach um and it's going to cost me 2.50 for an hour for example I know these are just thoughts and it's just an initial stage but these are thoughts that I don't know the answers to and for a family that's coming on the weekend um 2.50 an hour for example if they come for a four-hour visit it's ten dollars seems minuscule but when we look at um you 2011 when barrio farrell scrapped the um summer premiere various scraps the admission fees for mount and potential gardens uh there was a massive increase in visitors to the park I was a resident of campbelltown for my lifetime at that point and my family of a very low socioeconomic background would never visited that park except for on one occasion where I went through a school event so I wonder who would be occluded from visiting our beaches maybe maybe not um these are just my thoughts at the moment and I think we'll we have some time parking around some shop fronts I'm not sure if it's being policed but there is time parking there you know if you go down towards the brighton front shop front you've got half an hour parking quarter hour parking um does introducing the paid parking mean those people who parking there will park just further up in the other residential streets um and if the issue to be addressed and I am ignorant of the back you know of the full back history of this so I addressed is this you know these cars that are parking for long term um or permanently um perhaps just introducing time parking might be the solution and then there's the issue of a ranger perhaps and would we need to you know hire a ranger well if we did have just automatic rate license plate readers like miranda westfields um those often well usually they need someone to be operating in case they go faulty which they do sometimes when it rains so there's these thoughts and matters and I wonder that many ways are coming from to purchase these possible license plate readers if that is considered and then the revenue from the parking where will it go towards is it going to go towards new soccer fields or is it going to go towards maintenance um lifesaver I'm just throwing these thoughts out there we don't know and I wonder if council can you know perhaps highlight where the thoughts are what the thoughts are um but my main concern is just access you know this is a you know relatively historical fight for go to with their families not all are within walking distance and I don't think they should a bill I do agree that the issue should be addressed I wonder if there could be other considerations like time parking that is policed or time parking for two hours that's free and then perhaps paid thereafter um permit park parking permits for residents should definitely be an option something that you know councils around sydney have been doing for yonk um so it's just about equitable access is a concern for me and just something I'd like to keep the council to factor in in their planning of implementation that I don't think the two are mutually exclusive one we can address the issue and to not necessarily come at a cost to everyone um who including many of them who are bay side residents and I don't know what the data is on who visits our beaches the most is it bayside residents or is it not so I don't have that data and I wonder if council does um but they shouldn second disaster tax perhaps in the form of um paying you know a parking um needed parking requirements on top of their their rates um these are just my thoughts I know that council's got a lot of other things that they're factoring in um so I hope that will be taken into consideration and you know when I mentioned barrier farrow it's something that stuck from his era and it's limited of what benefit I can say he has given to to the new south wales state in my opinion um but it will speak thank you thank you mr hajj we appreciate you coming and sharing your concerns tonight thank you thanks christina I now invite mrs berhardian who's an affected resident who is speaking against the officer recommendation hello you've called phyto biharding please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can thank you all right well um I guess shall we um okay well we might just try once more please and if not we'll move on hello yes mrs bahadian are here tonight um speaking to the mata about the paid parking and um so I invite you and so I now invite you to speak to the councillors thank you well thank you for the opportunity my name is fica bihardin I live in ramsgate road in ramsday I work from home usually but of the last few years I've been taking care of my mum she's 95 years old and it's been quite a quite a challenge these last few years as you can imagine I try to get out whenever I can with her um by taking her down to the beach um I obviously I can walk but because of her age and her limited mobility I drive down park along the foreshore and it could be at any of the car parks and we transfer into the wheelchair and we go for a walk I was very concerned that council is considering making it paid parking that would certainly um deter us from from doing it as often as we can and you know it's important for us to get out paid parking um we also arranged to meet other people and other elderly people um and and try and get together that way um and I don't think they would be they would be able to to do that um if there was paid parking so that would certainly prohibit us and it I think it might prohibit some other people too um and I think parking should be free and available to everyone sorry in terms of particularly residents but I also think visitors there are a lot of visitors from other suburbs who come here and they clearly enjoy the foreshore and I just think the well-being of people especially through these challenging times is so important if they're enjoying the foreshore and getting out and about and getting fresh air um and I hope that um it it doesn't get up and as as I'm essentially opposing um paid parking on the for sure thank you mrs bahadian for joining us tonight and sharing your concerns thank you thank you for giving me the opportunity good night good night as there are no the item there is an officer's recommendation before us is there a mover um first of all we need to the item needs to be moved and seconded so is there a mover for the item moved council mcdougall seconded councillor nargi is there any discussion councillor mcdougall um thank you madam mayor and thank you to the speakers uh mr el haj and mrs baharian I agree with many of the points you made um and picking up on something that mrs baharian said um we want parking to be free and accessible but unfortunately those two sometimes can't go together we do have significant accessibility issues at the beach and that is what this motion is trying to address in a balanced way something that I think the motion doesn't make clear and that I would like to add to the motion is that no paid parking scheme should be implemented until a resident parking scheme permit scheme is in place or you can you can alter the minutes you know thank you we'll just deal with that thing I'm adding something to in bayside until we actually have a resident resident parking permits game in place um to ensure that all of our local residents are able to continue accessing the beach um I think that really needs to be a priority for us and as far as I'm aware throughout all these discussions um that's been the um that's been the the desire of all councillors involved we do we do have difficulty accessing accessing the beach on many occasions anyone who's been down there on a weekend during summer knows just how packed it is people will find a parking spot anywhere they can so this is just trying to alleviate some of those pressures this is done at beaches all across sydney there are very few beachfront locations particularly in places with as much beach as we're lucky to have um that don't have some form of some form of needed parking um and something else I'd like to address then I know you'll never convince anyone of this but this is not a revenue raising exercise in any way I it's fairly nominal fee a couple of bucks an hour um it is just to help turn over and make sure that as many people as possible can actually get get onto the beach because there is parking there and that when you come to bayside you know you will be able to access the beach so I'm happy to move that with that amendment to make it clear that we will have a resident parking scheme in place um before this is implemented um and I reserve my right to reply thank you councilman do we have a secondary for that motion counseling that is critical to me council mcdougall like certainly my intention is that it should be for all residents of the lga everywhere um that's how it's done in places like the northern beaches and pit water and manly and so on that have had this in place for a long time you live in bayside you pay rates to this council um you should have access to the beach here so in in and saying I thank you councillor mcdougall can that all of the lga uh not just residence team so if we include uh the whole of lga I'm happy with that so if I was the seconder no problem if I'm not that's fine thank you councillor nargi so we have an amended motion just for clarification then I'll speak on it so is it for all rate payers or is it all residents because there's a big difference rate payers is a different cohort it's actual residents that live out there so that's fine either way my expectation is and I totally support councillor mcdougall in in allowing or giving the opportunity for people who live in the area which again is all residents to be able to park there freely and be able to use the their neighborhood as they need to and I know what's happened in the past in the recent past especially around ramsgate which I'm very familiar with it gets overtaken in the morning when a certain sporting group goes there and it actually floods the place with 400 cars that's me if we put a scheme in place the majority of those people are from the local area and they were on occasion being booked because they tend to overstay their welcome for three hours because we tend to drive around and on occasion there's a little bit of leeway but I can understand the turnover of the require the need to have turnover of people there but most families who come from outside our district outside our area tend to come to spend the day they're not going to come for one or two hours or three hours or four hours so if the if the fee was two dollars and two dollars an hour they'd be there for 10 hours it's simple as that so we're not going to really turn over a lot most people come with all their goodies they come with their barbecues they come with their families they won't spend any money because they've brought it with them and they'll use our car park and use our beach so we've got to really think critically about critically think of how how much turnover we want and this will only work pretty much on sundays long weekends the occasional saturday the weekend doesn't really matter so we've got to think about putting something in place that's going to tell people to go away or tell people this is a welcoming community we want you to come however we have to charge a small fee for you for you to use our beach the other issue is the the conversation around brighton is a different conversation all together ramsgate I get I get kyma you're trying to get some people there but brighton services the shops we need to think about what we want to do there because it has a different impact on the community and it has a different long-term result because we're trying to build up the businesses there we're trying to give an opportunity for sorry my mask is killing me we try and give people an opportunity to go and frequent these shops but again don't stab them in the back we're saying okay here the intention also to have have a resident parking scheme in bay street for everyone in the lga so that needs to be fleshed out in number five will the car park um in brighton be a free car park for residents of the ocean again needs to be fleshed out if it's a free car park well there won't be much turnover because people park there all all the time and leave there overnight and go back in the morning and pick up their car again so there's a lot of questions that need to to be uh addressed the issue of um number four that I believe council savonowski brought up the rambutan beach nature strip medians be explored that's a bit of a difficult one because it's in between all those trees and there's a lot of people driving into the trees there's a lot of infrastructure to be done to to create that but there's an opportunity if you really want to go down that path but I think we'll have a bit of push back from chief thank you council students councillor barlow I'm actually going to move an amendment because I think you can't you cannot vote on number five without a costing if I'm saying you're going to give everybody is that what maybe I'm wrong I thought it was just a parking scheme for the local ramsgate brighton kyma but if it's the whole of the lga that could be a significant cost that isn't in the budget so I'm going to move an amendment this is deferred maybe to a information session because it was october when it was discussed last this was never brought into it and it is a cost to the council and to the resident so I'm just going to move an amendment that's deferred to a implementing session I'm happy with the second that I met sorry I'm happy to let councillor werner go first she has been waiting some time um did you want to go first oh thank you councillor hannah yeah she has been would you like to go first yeah thank is a good idea that we spend a bit more time thinking about this because um I think that paid parking would discourage some of the most vulnerable in our community from accessing the beach um as we learned in one of bayside's business papers from last year 27 of our residents are in housing stress and this means that they struggle to afford necessities such as food electricity and medicines after paying for housing so that's a lot of our fellow residents how will they afford to pay for parking people with mobility challenges need to be able to park close to where they are going and if they can't park next to the beach then they may not be able to go to the beach at all many locals regardless of their income will not want to pay but will drive their cars to the beach instead of using the beachside car parking they will then park in surrounding suburban streets this will make it more difficult for locals to find parking in front of their own homes going to beach is a wonderful environmental beach by making it more difficult to park their cars thank you thank you councilwoman are there any other councillor thank you madam mayor look I agree with everything councillor werner says I've got very very serious reservations about this this smacks of eastern suburbs and we are not the eastern suburbs what I would suggest to to this council I'm more than happy to support deferral to an information session to have a very robust discussion about this because there are definitely other ways to manage this rather than paid parking and even your mayoral minute outlined the sophisticated technology that is now available and there's a number of companies out there that where we can actually have timed parking where there is a certain amount of parking for free for visitors from outside the area as well as our own residence and as long as that is a reasonable amount of parking once they time limit once they tick over that they're automatically fined you know it may be three hours it might be four hours my own personal view is I think you a reasonable stay I i really don't think we should be going down this this cart blanche paid parking in our beaches I don't believe sutherland council does it they they've looked at this a number of times and this really smacks of eastern suburbs stuff so I'm very much in support of it going to information session because I really do think there are other ways of dealing with this um and you know I'm not convinced about it at all thank you madame thank you councilman councillor thank you madam look I i do support the officer's recommendation except I'm a bit concerned about uh resident parking scheme because we don't have a lot of information on that and that's the very reason I actually seconded uh council barlow's it's not to say that I disagree with paid parking I mean we've been working on this for many years I mean last term and the term before and a lot of money has been spent in terms of working out how we do the paid parking so broad in terms of resident parking are we talking about the car parks are we talking about when the car parks are full and cars are going to end up filling the side streets it's a lot more it's too broad to say resident parking scheme we need to look at the model before we actually vote on it that paid parking has to happen at our beachfront for sure because it's every other lga hazard the the bottom line is we've got expenses in terms of people coming in leaving their rubbish behind parking for you know 12 hours and especially in summertime so we need that turnover and we've been really discussing paid parking for a long time and the majority of councils do support it but once you introduce other factors into it about parking scheme for residents it becomes a little bit more complicated where we need to know the model before we vote on it and that's the very reason I uh second council of bala's amendment so I hope that everyone will agree on it we a better idea what we're voting on thanks madam thank you councillor rawaita um councillor saranovsky uh madame thank you for the opportunity to talk on this item first of all it costs our residents of bayside nothing today tomorrow next year or the year after to park in the car parks so what council mcdougall is moving is that our residents don't pay to park in the car parks so nothing's going to change so I'm not too sure I'm scratching my head what is the cost that's going to affect this council when today tomorrow next year it's going to be cost our residents zero dollars so there's no cost it is an ongoing situation uh madame down there and the idea is is not to affect the residents because they'll see no change at all what you've got down particularly down monterey area and some of my colleagues that have been on the council for a while will fully remember we have businesses we have trucks parked in the car park all day all day and all front all day all night that contribute nothing to this area not our thing they're denying our residents an opportunity to go and park in the beach I'm all in favor of going to the beach with the family I'm all in favor of it but somewhere down the track something's got to happen uh madam it's costing this council money to maintain these facilities for people that are outside our area they are tourists yes I love tourists but go down the summer months and see the caravans that park obviously coals and that we get nothing out of it like the residents of bayside get nothing out of it but I just want to say um this is not in the residential streets I had a few phone calls the last few days the residents of little grand parade want this their street included in this list they actually wanted because they're sick and tired of people parking outside their homes all day what they do is they park their car catch the bus go to the airport go to the city house uh on it and they're telling me bill we want paid parking in little grand parade actually they wanted and when we looked at ramsgate beach town center go down there you never find parking I just noticed kohl's the building has been sold so there's going to be a loss of parking now I can just as I said in conclusion um this is not going to cost our residents bay side residents based on residents any money at all and that's why I command councilman google for putting that in there and I always use the phrase some of my colleagues may no no let's go forward let's not go backwards let's not go close stancil let's go forward if we find out this doesn't work we just go back to what we had which was uh a mess that what is there today in terms of uh parking you get there on a sunday afternoon or sunday morning saturday morning down to um and andrew a council soon as we know you can't find parking at our residents I as the resident can't park down a rams skate or saint susie I'm comfortable with it and the protection is our rate payers our residents ratepayers will not it won't cost them anything thank you council saranovsky councillor cedric thank you madame uh I too am supportive of this motion um this concept has been flagged for a long time and the group has been working on it for a long time I think we're all looking forward to something like this my only question or the issue that I see is all bayside residents and rate payers are for this as long as they have a parking scheme and I don't mind that we charge people from other lgas as long as we don't charge ours my question through you whether it be our fellow councillors or the gm if we were to uh provide these parking stickers or parking permits to our 160 residents is that for a two hour block a four hour block can they park there can they park there can so if you live uh down to brighton can I park my car there for 10 hours that's my question can I get that answer I just want to clarify something because everyone's saying it's costing nothing maybe the staff can answer to issue everyone with a parking permit you've got to post it they've got to come in they've got to do something because administration cost it's a cost for the sticker ongoing cost each year because that you have to renew it every year for other resident parking scheme so that's what I'm talking about is the cost to every ratepayer if you're going to send a sticker to every single resident I don't know I mean to me that isn't a massive cost so that's why I've asked it to be the first so we can actually this was done in october I don't remember any of that I came to them I was on the meeting but it's quite complicated and I feel that it won't matter if we defer it for a little'm in I could be wrong a sticker for a parking seam is a cost to every rate payer councillor mcdougall um thank you madam mayor just to respond to the amendment and some of the comments made by councillors I think people are potentially working at cross purposes here so some of us have might have short memories council of barlow because we don't remember october but you also don't remember august when we actually last dealt with this in a full meeting of council and I'd just like to read out that parts of that quote from that resolution the council actually resolved to deal with the tenderers on this matter and delegated authority to the general manager to enter into a contract um with one of the tenderers or or multiple um so deferring this thank you grant grants the um the council officers the power which they have at the moment to implement this without a resident parking scheme so all my all this motion will do is continue to support that but ensure that that doesn't actually come into place without free to free to move the amendment and send this off to consultation and the staff could implement this tomorrow without a resident parking scheme which I am certainly not for so councillor werner um I noted in your space she kept referring to residents not being able to park I feel like some of those comments were perhaps repaired before the motion was actually put in the council tonight because obviously I think all the councils here perhaps not councillor barlow do support residents having free parking continuing along the beachfront in terms of some of those comments about how this actually looks I mean I don't think this can go forward without further consultation with council I don't think this motion is saying that let's send the staff off and whatever they come up with that they think is a resident parking scheme is what we proceed with this would obviously go through a consultation process with councillors and go back through council so ultimately all this motion does is ensure that before anything happens before parking meters go in which again the staff could that we develop a scheme for residents to be able to park there for free and that that happens before they actually go in which I think is very important thank you councilman mcdougall councillor now just a question for clarification our policy about a resident parking scheme when someone a resident applies to it there's a fee is this going to be waived or they're going to be charged and free um I might I might refer to the general manager please um through the chair um councillors tonight's discussion has raised a lot of issues that haven't been fully explored by the staff working back through the august decision of the full council and the subsequent october decision we have to date focused on the contractual arrangements with the supplier of the technology the hardware and the software I'm pleased to say that um in reference to councillor mcdougall's comments we haven't entered into any binding agreement for that although we have um we do have a preference for how we would proceed given now that we would be looking at on the foreshore and at brighton we would need to go back and really model that what the options are um in how you could roll that out what the financial implications of that are council will then will be come back to you with some considerations about the capital outlay for the scheme for the actual meters themselves the cost of that the cost of implementing a scheme and the likely revenue that we would receive for visitors only being charged sorry and just one further I'm sorry that's right um just one further point of clarification I would really hope that in this day and age we are not sending out a resident parking sticker to every resident I haven't seen a parking meter installed in the last 10 15 20 years um that hasn't been digital and hasn't coded to number plays um so this should not be a complex game to administer we shouldn't be using a lot of postage stamps um we're a modern council and we should be taking modern action please sorry thank you we're put so just for the purposes of new counsellors so the amen if the amendment amended motion is carried then it becomes emotion if it is um not carried we then revert back to the original motion okay so um for those purposes I will now um take a a vote I will put the motion so all those in favor please say aye all those against them sorry the amen yeah the amended motion yep although I put the amended motion thank you all those in favor of the amended motion say I against so hang uh hang on councillor thank you um so what we are voting on now is the amended motion the amendment the amendment sorry the amendment I i don't have I don't have it on a screen so no yeah number we're doing the number five the no paid parking which is councilman if they have an amended motion that's a foreign all right it's as it's a foreshadowed motion so what we we will now go to the original one that you can see up the top which has been added by councillor mcdougall so we are voting on the original motion with an additional number five added to it okay so that's what we're voting on right now that all those in favor say sorry just just point of clarification so the this this actual point has been pulled out of the the report so we're just simply voting on 5.2 or however it's numbered and then we're going to come back to the rest of the report is that correct yes we're pulling out 5.2 out of the uh the minutes of the bright and the sands working part okay thank you thank you council all right so now I will put the motion with the additional number five so all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried division has been called that means that all councils will indicate whether they are for or against so I will go around the room and please say yes or against councilor morrissey four councillor musket councillor fidel councillor janssen councillor nargi councillor saranovsky councillor tsunus councillor werner councilor so I am four okay the division was declared and has been carried thank you councillors so we will come back to the minutes of the prolight fright and the sans working party um when we go to the mid go through the minutes okay we are now moving to the next item which is the public another public forum forum item so this item is being pulled out of the minutes of the traffic bayside traffic committee meeting on the 15th of december 2021 and it relates to madden close botany which is proposed no stopping restrictions so councils received a written submission for this item so councillors will have been able to access that in their portal from mr vigorous who's an affected neighbour against the officer recommendation are there any speakers to this item councillor morrissey do you have to move it first I'll move it thank you councillor morrissey second second councillor janssen thank you uh thank you madam chair look at brett this um this submission uh is not in relation to the item I think that um they're two separate issues the traffic committee is actually reinstating parking spaces for residents that were removed without appropriate consultation last year and this was discussed at a previous committee meeting since I think there was approximately 17 or 18 car spaces removed from a very small narrow street and there was not appropriate consultation with residents there was a two strata manager involved a bit of a story behind it as a result of that I made representations uh on behalf of residents to director of city futures um and that the matter was the the area was looked at and it was determined that we can actually reinstate parking um along one section of street um I think it's eight car spaces from memory so I haven't got the I haven't got the numbers so the net there's still a net reduction in parking but we're actually putting parking back this is a this is a high density um a high density location that has a couple of thousand units sitting there so parking as a premium so what I'm what I would like is for because it is this this item be carried because it's reinstating parking however that the the written submission provided by miss um mr zvigaru I think his name is be added to the agenda for the next uh traffic committee meeting his concerns relate to moving a traffic island in the middle of the street the street is cut into where the traffic comes and no through road and there's some access concerns with that and there's a petition around around that so they're two separate matters so I'm speaking in favor that uh of this motion um and I would like to make sure that um the the person who's made the submission that that item is added to the next traffic committee agenda thank you thank you council morrissey is there any further discussion all right we'll now put the motion all those in favor say aye against I declare the motion carried the next public forum item is in relation to railway street rockdale which is detailed design drawing for proposed traffic calming treatments and this is part of item committee meeting which was held on the 27th of january 2022 so again we have one written submission for this item from mrs mastromuro who's an affected neighbour speaking against the officer recommendation so again the written submission was distributed to councillors prior to the meeting I'll in addition um is so um this is um I am mrs master murrah um oh thank you um you're here excellent well I invite you to please come up and and um you're speaking against the officer recommendation just up here thank you good evening madam mayor and councillors I'm here to address the proposal for the two speed humps in herbert street rockdale we are not opposed to change but feel that the speed humps are not suitable a suitable resolution to the problem at hand I realize that we are just one family and appreciate the time taken out to be heard our main concern is that we could potentially end up with no street parking in front of our house depending on the proposed type of speed hump used I trust that um you we voice our concerns as we have lived in the house for 34 years and we have seen growth in the area an issue that and issues that have arisen over time the speed hump at 1a herbert street parking has always been an issue for the residents in herbert street because of its close proximity to the railway station schools church and shops in 2000 we went as far as having plans drawn and submitting a da for a double garage unfortunately this did not go through residential parking was also denied at this time we strongly oppose losing the parking in front of our house as we are already restricted by our surrounding neighbours on one side we have number one herbert street a dwelling subdivided into three rental properties that can have up to six cars at any given time and no on off street parking on the other side we have 11a watkins street which has a church a hall and a residence that was the council has passed as hostile living there therefore for one block requires a lot of parking the parking in watkins is in herbert street we have three cars in our residence one of which is garage the other two are on off on street parking if the watts speed humps installed have the islands on either side we would lose the parking altogether and cause this would cause further safety issues for us I look after my mother who is 80 years old or 82._._4752.56 three days a week she has physical restrictions and a respiratory issue she cannot walk up the hill and if it was if I was to park in front of one herbert street there is a park bench on the grass strip that is built on an upraised concrete platform which would pose a tripping hazard for her two I also have two toddler grandchildren that I look after on a regular basis three reversing out of our garage over a speed hump is certainly not an ideal situation especially when it is at the bottom of a hill you can't see what's coming over the hill basically where we are not qualified traffic controllers we are not traffic qualified controllers but we in front of our house and at the top of the hill to slow down the traffic as it approaches the intersection of herbert and watkins streets as for this intersection a major issue is vehicles entering herbert street from watkins street cutting the corner on the wrong side of the road this has happened a numer on numerous occasions to me family members and no doubt others um there is a painted island there at the moment we feel that a solid concrete upraised island would be more appropriate and would prevent cars from doing this but will also force cars coming out of herbert street to slow right down making it safer for other motorists and pedestrians trying to cross the road and get to school and church safely it is also um it will also save the stop signs stop sign that has been hit endless times this solution would also admit the need for the proposal for a speed hump coming into herbert street other than these recommendations maybe maybe and as well as my written email a roundabout intersection may also be an acceptable resolution issues both in this talk and email are taken into careful consideration when making your decisions thank you very much thank you yes and speaking to the item okay councillors there are no more public speakers on this item so we'll now deal with the item there is an officer's recommendation before us is there a mover and a seconder I can move an amendment I'd like to move an amendment that we defer the matter to an on-site meeting so we can actually go and see what's going on do we need to have a mover and a second okay so we've got um mover is cancelled soonest and second is counselor awarder yep so I'll move it to an on-site meeting and try and get the next traffic committee uh for any changes as has come out of that meeting I guess so interested ward councillors or any councils that are interested come down one afternoon and let's just have a look at what's going on there and explore other possibilities if there is a very tight bottleneck of parking the statutory distance from the station that we can't lose that parking as a result of any action come through mr barber um through you madame um there's no parking lost with the speed hump that's proposed in this case you can actually park over it um it's one of those low profile ones it doesn't have any islands on the edges okay um the other suggestions that the resident made we'd have to have a closer look at so I was going to say we had the experience up at um up around the streets of stoney creek road last year in terms of speed humps nobody wants it in front of their house so let's let's explore it um it can't hurt we'll just delay it for another month and see what we can come up with so if other people are supported you'd be very good talking is there any further discussion oh sorry madame just if if council assurance wouldn't mind amending that to to include in there because we've had a resident knows her strength she knows her area she knows what works and what doesn't work so what I would like to see happen if it's possible is if this is deferred for an on-site meeting and the resident who did an exceptional job tonight addressing this council be invited to attend along with other other interested residents from that area and and this is what this is all about this is dealing people into the decision-making of this council we've got a perfect opportunity to do it so madam mayor I don't know if council assumes prepared to amend it to include that I think we should be inviting the speaker tonight and any other interested resident from that street thank you councillor hannah councillor soonest do you accept that thank you is there any further discussion on this matter all right so therefore then councillors we are voting on the amended motion which is that this matter be deferred until an on-site meeting can be held with affected residents and then the findings reported back to the bayside traffic committee so all those in favor the um for the purposes of our well-being and not sitting for long periods I encourage all councillors to stand up and and staff and stretch we might just take a minute if councillors would like to get another drink or we will resume the meeting if you would kindly take your seats please thank you councillors all right we now we continue our public forum and we are up to item 10.5 and this is a notice of motion in relation to climate action 2022 so we have three people that have registered to address the meeting and therefore uh each speaker will be afforded three minutes to make their points with the second and third speaker please adding any new or additional information so um our first registered speaker is miss kim clifford is miss clifford present is miss clifford online or present no all right I note that miss clifford is not present therefore we move to uh miss vanjic who is an affected neighbor speaking for the motion who will be speaking online I now invite you miss magic you can unmute and speak hello thank name is taylor book van dyke I'd like to begin by acknowledging acknowledging the traditional owners of the gadigal of the um oiora nation on a land that was never seated I'm speaking in support of motion 10.5 climate action firstly I would like to congratulate council and council greater wartnor for on this forward thinking direction um excuse me miss van dyke can I just interrupt you um we're finding a little bit hard to hear you if you wouldn't mind speaking a bit closer to the microphone and just slowing down just so we can ensure we capture everything you say please is that better I think so thank you sorry is that better yes please go ahead yeah so I i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the gadagal and the euro nation and the land that was never seated and so I was going to say where you left off was fine but that's okay thank you okay thank you I'm speaking in support of motion 10.5 climate action and I would like to congratulate the council on bayside I am an interested and informed resident of bayside and I reviewed the current information available and I am impressed but I would also like to see that more investment is needed in this space and an acknowledgement that we are in a climate emergency is really necessary to ensure that we are giving this wicked problem the respect it deserves real climate action is invaluable to me as a young person I don't need to remind council to why this is important as the science is clear that we need to act now and the choices that this council and all government entities make today is going to impact our future possibly to our detriment I implore all members of bayside council to support this motion so that in 50 years when we reflect on history all members of this council can say that they did everything that they could to ensure that we are seeking for the best interest of not only the environment and ourselves but also council's reputation for promoting sustainability thank you for your time thank you very much miss van dyke speaking for the motion who will be speaking online mr strong uh you can now unmute and speak hello we can hear you thank you okay can you hear me clearly we can thank you okay so just go ahead please do yes um so yeah my name is peter strong I live in eincliff I'm here on um I'd like to recognize it's a big land and pay respects to aboriginal people past present and future and um for most of my life I've been involved in environmental activism and more more recently in the bay side area and working with some local environmental groups including the greens climate change has got to be the biggest issue uh facing humanity and I think it's uh it's really important that we recognize it and start to act in in all levels of government local and and um national international climate change is a global problem with a variety of impacts currently being felt around the world keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is considered a critical limit to protect lives they are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the bayside local government area bayside council should lead the community of bayside by both implementing and supporting effective action like other councils have uh for example wollongong council and many councils and and loads of initiatives for all over the world um and many on a local level council should set net zero emission targets for 2030 for bayside lj and also recognizes the significance of its own contribution to the city's emissions and the need to demonstrate leadership and set a target of net zero emissions especially for its own operations bayside council should be part of the solution and declare a climate emergency climate changes is a global problem with variety of impacts currently being felt it's um mostly been related to human activities and that's scientifically proven the burning of fossil fuels coal gas land clearing global temperatures have been increasing in the last century new south wales natural hazards such as heat waves heavy rainfall the severe bushfire conditions have occurred more often have been more intense so yeah we've really got 1.5 degrees and I think it's um really important that bayside council declare a climate of major emergency and can and demonstrate that they are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the bayside local government area bayside council should lead the community and the community will follow you know I think people really think it's important that they get involved so if the council starts bringing initiatives forward I think the public will react positively and the public will want to get involved um you know in all the different aspects of how we can reduce our emissions um other councils who have taken such initiatives of being committed to the following pledges install renewable energy solar pv on council buildings implement landfill gas methane flowing for capture for electricity generation encourage sustainable transport use such as public transport walking and cycling set city level renewable energy emissions to production targets adopt best best practice energy efficiency measures across council buildings support community facilities to adopt these measures there's many ways we can do it and um it's something that a lot of people can the most important uh things that we've got to do across the planet so um I live in bayside I really want to see bayside declare that emergency and I want to help you know in any way that I can as a lot of people will want to do so I really support the motion to declare if I'm an emergency uh that that's all I have to say thank you mr strong okay thanks for listening thank you okay as there are no more speakers on this item we will now deal with the item so there is a motion before us is there a mover and a secondary so we have a mover greta okay sorry councillor werner is there a seconder um it is seconded by councillor douglas so I have a mover and a seconder to the motion would you like to speak to the motion council owner thank you so this motion acknowledges climate change and the role that we all have as individuals and organizations in acting to bring our climate back to less risky temperatures the most recent intergovernmental caused by human actions this means that we working together can prevent further damage to the climate for example by switching to renewable resources instead of using coal and gas to provide us with energy as madam mayor has informed us in her mayoral minutes bayside has a proud track record of taking action to protect our environment bayside council has solar power installations and our street lights are in the process of being converted to led lights while these are important initiatives bayside council has no overall understanding of all the opportunities that council has to address climate change nor a plan with goals targets and metrics so residents can rest assured that our council knows what it's doing when it comes to the climate we need a climate mitigation plan because planning to fail oh sorry failing to plan is planning to fail the insurance council of australia has made a public statement on climate change which reads in part climate change is occurring along a rapid and severe pathway and without intervention it presents a serious risk to environments economies and communities worldwide the impacts of the occurrence of more frequent and intense extreme weather events sea level rise and global mean temperature increase now the need for action on climate is acknowledged across the political spectrum our liberal state government's net zero plan states that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require more than action from the state and commonwealth governments it will require action from local government business communities and individuals and for those who say that climate action is not a local council issue here is another excerpt from the liberal state government's new net zero plan which says that new south wales councils play a key role in supporting decarbonisation as local leaders and through their connection to local communities by reducing emissions council can help increase resilience of their communities and act as a catalyst for new south wales to meet its net zero emissions objective now this shows that the state government expects local councils to take a leading role in climate mitigation and adaptation the labour party agrees that climate targets are important its powering australia policy says alongside the economic benefits our plan will reduce australia's target under the paris agreement whether scott morrison can see it or not we are in a race now many of our neighbouring councils such as ranwick inner west canterbury bankstown and canada bay have already declared a climate emergency in fact 107 councils around australia have declared a climate emergency and some councils such as wollongong city council have climate mitigation plans bayside does not have to reinvent the wheel here we can build on what other councils have already done and adapt their work to suit our own circumstances so making climate mitigation and adaptation plans cost money bayside council can well afford this given it has an operating surplus of more than 11.8 million dollars its projected year-end result as listed in today's council business papers the executive team can choose how this work is done by existing council staff or contractors or some other way making climate mitigation and adaptation plans takes time and scientists are telling us we have no time to lose so let's support this motion so our council can get on with making the plans and preparations that residents thank you thank you councilwerner councillor jackson thank you madam mayor and speakers and thank you for that detailed reply councillor werner there's a lot of information mentioned in your notice of motion beyond the climate emergency declaration I think addressing climate change is critical and we can undertake significant actions with and for the community as local government but on speaking to fellow councillors I sent sense that we need an opportunity to get a greater understanding of the details of that notice emotion before making a decision on it and what's outlined in it so therefore I'd like to propose an amendment that this item goes to information session for counsellors in order for us to make a more informed decision on it thank you thank you so I have a mover for the amended most driver secondary counselor tsunas any further discussion so I like to ask the general manager who said or whoever whoever suggested this motion is in order what is a climate emergency like that terminology is new to me like I'm not part of political I'm just a definition for it can we have that definition if not I'll ask something else after that and I think counselor students that is the purposes of um having an information session and that's the amendment that council jansen has put up because it's um you know counselors do have questions such as you've just indicated counselor sooner so I think that would be um the right place for us to explore to flesh it out yeah that's fair enough okay I understand and my other concern is look most of us especially in the council sphere in the area of local government we strive for the best we had that conversation about an hour ago when we first started here we spoke about doing the best we can with waste doing the best we can with the resources we put down well let's face it we're still using carbon we're using electricity that's fossil fuels right and I can't see the greens because the party politics were brought into play here where conversations about the greens about the labor well I want to hear what the greens position is in terms of local government there's no there's a conversation about okay let's get zero emissions but not how to get there not the pathway not the the way to achieve it now is the way to achieve it stop using electricity stop driving our cars I don't know what it is I'm not trying to be flipping but there's obviously a target to be achieved and if the target is to stop having our luxuries as we call it well fair enough I get that if that's a position that a certain group in the political sphere have that's fair enough but we've got to live in reality and face the facts that certain things need to be done to maintain our level of of quality of life and the way we we do things um it's disappointing that that's been brought into this fear into party top politics has come into this chamber we have things that are the mechanisms that control the way we deal with do our developments we have our waste streams that control how we do best best practice iso 9000 and so on there's best practice ways of doing things now we're talking about an emergency where did the emergency come from but I guess we're going to flesh that out at the at the information session and I i hope that everyone attends and um brings their questions with them on the night thank you thank you councillor soonest council learner did you wish to speak um you it's an amendment so you have you can speak to the amendment thank you um I don't agree with um uh putting this off I think this is an emergency and emergency means to me it means that we need to do something we acknowledge that it's important and we need to do something now so and scientists are telling us this and you're a smart um person who has a soon at some point excuse me sorry counsel when that's not appropriate okay so the what um what I would suggest though if this _''_6312.0 is maybe we could take it in seriatum and maybe go through each item and see whether people um can agree with specific parts of the motion thank you councillor werner um we have councillor douglas who wishes to speak councillor douglas hi hi council members I just want to be clear that in my day job I work as a specialist around climate action so I wanted to address council as soon as concerns um if you look at the interplanetary uh committees on climate action climate change uh that have been being rolled out there is a climate emergency the science is clear we have a losing time we are behind schedule in terms of reducing our emissions globally australia is the worst if one of the worst or the second worst I think it is in the world in terms of our lack of reduction in carbon emissions and it's because of party political issues it's because we haven't had clear leadership from our federal government and it is very sad that this issue has been caught up with party politics and I really to show that we can work together for the sake of our children for their future we don't want piecemeal measures I i I appreciate the mayoral minute I understand it's great that we have a lot of work that's been done towards the environment but we need a comprehensive strategic climate action plan a comprehensive strategic climate action plan this is what wollongong willara waverly willoughby sydney city council ryde randwick northern beaches north sydney council mossman lane cove in the west hunters hill canterbury bankstown and canada bay blacktown all have these climate emergencies declared already we are behind the eight ball on this okay there's already 108 councils in australia who have supported this declaration it concerns me that yes not all councils have this understanding around climate change and I do support an information session to get people up to speed because I think this is actually the number one issue that councils do need to be across for the safety of our residents and for future generations and in fact it's actually in our community strategic plan that we are thank you councillor can I just clarify madame through you counselor douglas are you speaking for or against the amendment because you said you were four you're saying yes for the motion but then you said your foreign information session as well thank you councilman yeah um so councillor douglas are you speaking for the so we're currently debating debating the amendment so are you for against the amendment look I'm for the amendment because it does concern me that we do need to have everybody on board and up to scratch with this as leaders in the community and if it requires an information session to do so then we should do that thank you councillor douglas are there any more speakers okay councillor cedric thank you madam mayor I'll be brief as well thank you um sorry sorry did you say something um sorry madame uh look uh I i think we um I support uh councillor jansen's uh motion to defer in that I think we need to be educated on this there's some big points here that we that were better at climate outcomes my issue that I've got though and questions and maybe I could be enlightened through this information session is the language used such as climate emergency the greatest threat to humanity greatest threat to civilization and this panel of climate council advisory experts there's a lot of questions around that and I know that sorry growing up in the 80s and the 90s it was known as global warming and then now we call it global change sorry sorry used to be global uh sorry climate change now it's climate emergency I would love some better education about what this means how it's changed why are we doing this from my my my limited information that I thought I did think it was a federal issue but more importantly I thought bayside was doing a good job and we just received this award I was just speaking to my fellow colleague about you know this waste and cleansing services that receive this wonderful award so from my perspective other than being educated which I would love to see and do I thought to have a deferred uh information session just to understand and if we're not doing a good job if we shouldn't have received this award who got the award uh council whoever if we didn't get this if this maybe we need to get more awards I thought we're doing a good job um so I respect the motion but I think we need to be better educated thank you councillor cedric are there any more speakers all right therefore I put the amended motion and the amended motion by councillors johnson souness is that this matter be deferred um to a councillor information session you can you no because it's on the it's on the amendment not on your motion so it's the um so counselor jansen would you like a right of reply thank you therefore I put the motion all the amended motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried okay we now move to public forum item 10.7 so this notice of motion is in relation to leash-free areas in bayside so we currently counsellors we phone so we now ask hello miss um are you online I am online yes thank you you now have the opportunity to speak with councillors thank you so much thank you so I could just have a minute to bring up my notes certainly thank you um good evening everybody uh to the mayor and to the other council's prison my name is christina I'm a resident of dolls point I have been for 10 years now and certainly hope to stay in the area for a long time I live with my husband and my three-year-old daughter the issue I wish to speak about today is the uh allowing of more areas for dogs without a leash um unfortunately but I just um sorry for interrupting can I just clarify so you are speaking against the motion correct against the motion thank you please go ahead thank you thank you um I have a phobia of dogs it's very debilitating I wish I never had the phobia I've tried many things but certainly can't_''_6768.4 overcome it I don't want my daughter growing the lga that are known for pet owners where they can allow their dogs off a leash you certainly won't be catching me in those areas and I'd be steering clear of those areas but I do understand the importance of having these areas for the dogs and for the owners alike since forever I've been afraid to go on walks in the street or the park or the beach without a chaperone and besides walking to my car from my place I don't take walks alone due to the fear of encountering dogs of a leash although hello hello we can still hear you sorry due to fear of encountering a dog off a leash although it is generally illegal to have an unrestrained animal unfortunately often I see dog owners with no regard to the rules or to others many times on the beach where there are clear signs to say no dogs there are animals running freely on the beach it is the most terrifying thing to feel as a dog is running towards me often my husband or I will ask people would be laughed at or completely ignored this has been very hard for me especially during the pandemic where I've had to stay home work from home during the lockdown period with my daughter and not be able to take her on a walk outside during lunch time it was hard for me when I had postnatal depression looking after a baby and not being able to go outside there are many people in my position although you may not hear from them today for whatever reason people like me are present in the community in our lga if you increase the areas to allow the dogs to run freely like the lady robinson beach where there are no fences or defined borders unfortunately some dog owners will not respect the rules as is already happening I have seen on occasion council rangers in their vehicles parked in front of the beach and dog owners in sight with unrestrained dogs and nothing being done it's disheartening and often I don't feel brave enough to speak out because I don't want to be ridiculed but not today what I have said and request that you make a decision with people like me in mind I understand that I'm in the minority but I ask that you listen and respect how we feel as a minority thank you very much for listening to me and taking into account what I've said tonight no thank you very much for joining us tonight and sharing your concerns thank you thank you are there any um so do I so there's no other speakers from the audience so there is a motion before us do I have a mover for the motion council of an amendment actually um yep count um uh madame well we'll just do this so councillor seconded by councillor mcdougall uh with the amendment uh sorry did you have a move in a second okay I'll move an amendment that uh actually we've had a trial in 2021 2022 we I have not personally seen the outcome of that trial so I guess my concern is to move a motion to have off leads free 24 hours seven days a week so can I um suggest councillor awada that we perhaps ask council officers if um they've got the the data sure thank you councillor I might refer to mrs dawson through you madame mayor um the the extension of the off-leash area at lady robinson's beach was in response to the covert lockdown and the curfew period it wasn't actually described as a trial it was for a specific period of time for a specific purpose so we do have statistics around the number of infringements that were issued during that time and the number of infringements from the base before we started with the 24-hour access so we can make that available we certainly could put a report together but the reason we haven't is because it wasn't actually a trial it was just a specific period of time up till the covert curfew ceased thank you so exactly my point is we don't have enough information about the infringement and and during that time but prior to the covet with with the lockdown and we had that specific period we have no on the rest of the community that don't want to have dogs off leash so until we see what infringement who actually whether we've had any incidents I mean we we could be liable I mean liability to council would be messy so I can't support the motion that will just simply have the area converted to 24 hours seven days dogs off each without seeing evidence that it's not going to impact the the whole community rather than the community that will develop and I i take the lady that spoke I i do believe that we should take that into consideration and then defer this for more detailed information about and if I could get a seconder to defer it to see exactly what actually was the outcome or if uh with the doctor of city life about the infringement how many infringements we've had we might have had a few we might have had a lot so we need to see that information before we could actually make a decision on on this motion thank you madam me available we do have evening but we certainly could make that available I'm happy to second deferral um am I able to speak to that now or um so yep amendment which is uh just a modification pretty much of the original um and it has just some additions to it like five and so on so I don't know how that falls into play even though I've been on council for a bit yeah yeah so the four shout out amendment um is to put someone the opportunities arisen now to put some additional locations on the radar for council to look at to make them off-leash but an enclosed area so we've had a lot of conversations around here last year and I've lost track it might have been the year before we had a lot of conversations about off-leash un enclosed areas I'm four enclosed areas we've got a small dog at home and if I let him go it'll disappear on us and never see him again so I prefer to have within an enclosure and I've got a list here do you want to read it down mr faster you want to do that okay so examples of where green space and this is courtesy of a number of residents including claire curtin who we've been speaking speaking about opportunities within our lga in terms of creating a off-leash dog area which is people don't have to hop in the car to get there so they're within 20 minutes or half an hour of their house so the first one is bestik street open space I've provided this will we can maybe do dot points and then we can embellish upon it um besties street open space west of white oak reserve wodak reserve of bestic street which is on the boundary of ward 3 beehag street on spring street quite a large area hardly anyone goes to that park green space north of the bridge over the canal of linwood crescent um which is called natty place reserve in our mapping system barely used again um rockdale park part of rockdale park a small part of it I know it's a very nice park the rugby fields behind redmond or the area behind redmond field and greg arkenfield grass netball courts all all at the back of west botany street um part of barton park that we're proposing to redevelop surely there's some some small area that we can allocate to to to the uh the dog enclosure and then riverine park either on west botany street at the disused baseball diamond or further in past the driving range there's opportunities there to create an area which is safe maybe that last one maybe not as not as obvious because it's in a uh it's in a sort of quiet part of the park and the other item which I'd like to bring up which is can I just yeah just to address council as soon as can I before you move on just on that point to give to to add to your foreshadowed amendment uh is to give other ward councillors across the wards to nominate parks as part of the consultation yeah because that's that's quite specific but just again well I just others to bring the same because I don't expect every one of those to be an opportunity but like so as I said around I don't expect every one of those to be developed but if there's one or two opportunities there at a reasonable cost let's let's create that for the community the last item that I had to to bring as well is another dot point I guess is currently we have a regulation that dogs on leash are not permitted on the beach can I just confirm that with director of city life now if we've created a precedent now being a legal person for some reason if we create a president we can have dog or flesh and kyima what can we have dog on leash everywhere else on our beaches so that's what I'd like to put there and see if we can do that because a lot of people have come to me and said look the range is fine they don't find us but they tell us to pack up and go but surely put their feet in the water and then you take off they're on leash they're under control and if they're gonna do um a doggie do whatever it is they still people still have their bags they're still responsible that's the idea so within the whole of our lga the whole of our area people that are responsible to pick up after their dogs I guess so I can't see the beach being any different so I'd like to put that up see if we can see if we can carry that um thank you thank you councillor sooner so we have um a foreshadowed amendment I guess because the points that you raise actually align somewhat with point three of the original motion which is that bayside council investigate the establishment of new leash free areas so perhaps if I put it to the original um counselor mcdougall morris in saranovsky um would you be open to would you be open to a slight amendment there that would suggest we investigate additional areas all right I'd suggest I'd be happy three and four first quite specific areas um I would suggest adding a 0.5 to investigate some or some of those areas for further for further advancement so perhaps if would you be happy if we say investigate um additional areas where we're coming or where community have that indicated a desire perhaps so um yeah so that that then goes to the original motion so if yep so is everyone all right any other speakers to that matter in putting up only yeah in putting that so I'll say in agreeing to the notice of motion um I've just got some reservations what council services nominated a couple of sites in particular riverine park and barton park in terms of the overall development we're going to have down at the um future so um if we're going to investigate a fine but I'm not not convinced that but there is there is a a pathway there is a pathway believe it or not actually I walk the neighbor's dog now every sunday and I get to know her because my wife won muddy creek and that and then walk around the stadium so there is a pathway there yeah um so I think council saranovsky that's just to investigate additional areas not specific yep now in the reason one of the reasons why I co-signed the noticed emotion madame was in relation to the 24 hours can I just say for those that don't know nine to five jobs are gone it doesn't exist anymore it doesn't exist pre-covered over after copper whatever nine to five doesn't exist anymore the hours that we are working now are completely different by reading the paper yesterday or the day before the premier is actually looking at the hours of schooling not to be a traditional school in hours if we are a dynamic city around the world after we get over covered we're going to go back to a 24 hour city on it and the and I understand some of the concerns that some of the colleagues may have in relation to um leased and unleashed areas in terms of attack but I don't want to for you madame are we looking at infringement 5 10 20. like I don't I won't hold you to it there's a large small amount of infringement um I have I have just received an email about the numbers yet to be substantiated but there were seven reported dog attacks on councils approved of flesh dog beach between 13th of august and 30 november 2021 when the trial when the when the extension ran for none of those proceeded to infringement as they were unsubstantiated and difficult to determine which dog was at fault dog-to-dog yeah so because they're excited is um so perhaps um we can we can look at investigation yeah like I know that um local residents around kendall street reserve did organise a petition for that area to be considered I think it's worth looking at I do understand that it's contaminated the alternative side at riverside dry has been presented as well but I think it'll be valuable to go through that process with the community and if they're dead set on it I think we should have to consider the sites contaminated one thing I noticed um um you know whether it's lewis to unleash areas it actually surprised me um it was probably in the top five of what constituents spoke to me about in the area uh on it so I certainly agreed happy to be associated with the summation thank you council saronoski all right there be no further discussion then um so we are moving um the it's the original motion with an additional two points which simply state to investigate additional areas and that council investigates investigates that counsellor hannah right thank you madame um I'm I wish to speak to the amendment to defer it can I speak to that now or what what part are we up to we're putting the motion now so the amendment yeah so just just to clarify I think we we need to put the amendment first to your point councillor hannah yes so speak for against the amendment we put the amendment and if that if that carries it gets deferred if it if it doesn't then then the amendment now yes good thank you thank you thank you amendments um just no thank you thank you for that uh look first of all I want to say with matters such as this which is a proposal to extend what I would describe as free range area for dogs um it's good to see that we have councillors mcdougall morrissey and seraphinovsky taking the lead and um madam madame mayor it's also good to see the way that you're conducting these these meetings and you're giving everyone the opportunity to speak because on this particular matter I was a little bit concerned that you might try and muzzle us look I i went I went down to I went down to kyema I went down to kyema to to have a site visit to have a look at this area and look the area does present quite well in my view for a you know an off-leash area despite the fact that it isn't fenced but that's something that does concern me a little bit because it is it is in just wondering whether or not when we consider these types of things whether or not there's some way of better delineating where the off-leash area starts and finishes you know I know you that you can't sort of run fences across you know the beach it's that's just not practical um you know maybe maybe there could be some signage better signage on the beach itself you know perhaps we've got all those gate numbers um for dogs we we could maybe have a sign with the um the letter k a dash and the number nine ah um something like that um but look I'm when I was last on council I was a strong proponent of these off-leash areas but in particular fenced off leash areas and I do remember when we had one moved from monterey across to the other side on civic avenue there I think it's still there and I think that's a pretty popular one and we just missed the opportunity at the time madame because I remember at the time up at the gold could have been invited to the official opening of that with pistol and boo unfortunately barnaby joyce got involved and we anyway look I i think I think the off leash dog area is a great idea but I really do think there has to be some more enforcement of those that do not stick by the rules I i have a dog that I care for myself and I walk in areas that are not off-leash areas and I have been nearly attacked a couple of times by dogs that are simply allowed to run off leash and of course the response from the owners quite often is oh they won't hurt you but the simple fact of the matter is if it's an off-leash area that's fine but if it's not then they must be on a leash so the resident that spoke today tonight made some extremely good points and I think that's where we've really got to crank up the enforcement against those dog owners that are not responsible dog owners and quite often when I'm walking in these not off leash areas quite often I see dog poo bags they actually pick up the poo in a plastic bag and then fling it you would actually be better off not to put it in the bag so we really need if we're going to be expanding these areas we really need to concentrate on the enforcement and most dog owners are very responsible but there are some out there that are not and I've been on the receiving end of it myself I really do think we need to go to an information session because I think there's a lot more in this than just having a 24-hour off-leash dog area at one part of a beach or or another park there's a lot more in it and that's why I'd like to see go to the information session thank you so encourage other councillors to support thank you councillor hannah um no other speakers therefore we are now sorry I'll speak against the amendment thank you councillor mcdougall um with all due respect to the to the mover and second up the wrong trade and look I've got I've got my hackles up counselor hannah thinks he has the exclusive right to be an amateur comedian um unfortunately he's no longer speaking um look this uh off-leash area has been operating very successfully for a number of years and as councillor sarah vanovsky very eloquently put schedules have changed people are enjoying time in a different way and quite often people are taking their lunch break and going out for a walk um so this daytime restriction is really affecting people's ability to use these beaches um sorry to use these off-leash areas um this is a great community amenity and look I do I do um I do really sympathize um with the speaker but I think we and behavior I've certainly seen is that if you're an irresponsible dog owner and as uh councillor hannah said um you might have your dog off legion that might be running up to people in in designated unleashed areas um if you're irresponsible you're going to be irresponsible regardless of where we set's part of this issue uh look I do think we need to move ahead with this I've seen these off leash areas being delayed deferred cancelled everything every throughout the last term of council we've I've heard from a great number of residents that this area at claimer is very well enjoyed I'm sure council of morris he can say the same of the area at much park um I just think we need to move ahead with this and as we continue to investigate new areas thank you council mcdougall any other speakers all right therefore we are um putting the amendment so the amendment is moved by councilman hannah that the matter be deferred so um all those in favor of the amended motion say aye against I i declare the motion we can have a division um so we shall go around the room as soon as we get it on the screen all right so this is the amended motion council of morrissey councillor musket councillor fardell councillor janssen council anarchy councillor saronoski council sooners councillor werner councillor wada councillor barlow douglas against please that was against for the purposes of the record councillor douglas was against councillor mcdougall councillor etc therefore I declare the motion the amended motion lost so now um we go back to the original motion and um the original motion stands as in the papers which with the additional editions of five and six just just on five uh madam chair can we put the ones I've listed back in there and then another line that says there's an opportunity for others to to bring additional areas down the track that way some work can be started on it yeah so we can put with um here's some suggestions with other suggestions to follow thank you very much all right so um sorry any other speakers um councillor douglas yes councillor douglas you are now speaking to the original motion including five and six including five and six did I just suggest that on sex there that we also make sure that investigation looks into the impact of shorebirds on the beach because whilst I support uh you know designated areas for off-leash I have got concerns about having dogs all across the beaches because we do have very ecologically important dunes there sand dunes that the council is working hard to re-vegetate um and I think we need to take that into consideration with having dogs on larger areas of the beach thank you councillor douglas um it will be an investigation in its first instance and would come back to council before any decisions were made so noted thank you all right I'm now going to put that motion so all those in favor of the motion say aye against declare it carried all right we now move to public forum item which is 10.9 so this notice of motion is the community engagement on nuisance driving behavior council has received one written submission for this item from miss dowd and who is for the motion and the written distrib written submission was distributed to councillors prior to the meeting in addition one person has registered to address the meeting by phone and that is um sandra smith who is speaking for the motion so mrs smith are you online I just ask you to go close to the microphone speak slowly so that we can hear you thank you yes I'll just turn my volume off here right my name is sandra smith and I live in princess street in brighton the sands I've lived here for nearly 12 months and I just wanted to talk about how I feel that this move to have the noise registering cameras located I would really like to have one located in princess street I live up the uh novatel end of princess street we have high rise apartments on both sides of the road and at the present time we have cars coming down in the hours which are already designated to be no left turn into princess street we have cars coming down and exploding their exhausts so badly I've had to bring the police 16 times since I've lived here to try and get someone to come and do something about it in fact it's so loud that one the first the first weekend after lockdown was lifted a car went down exploded their it was that loud so I'd like princess street to be considered for one of the locations of the noise sensitive um cameras that you're talking about installing so can I just um one moment miss strong let me just clarify so you are speaking to item number 10.9 which is in relation to commune engagement on nuisance driving behavior which is about a report where different recommending a program for community engagement is that correct which is not related directly to the cameras I just wanted to clarify uh well that was just sort of an introduction into what I wanted to say about the cameras because it's bedlam I'm not kidding the the the effect of the double story the tenon well we've got seven stories on our side and I think there's eight or nine on the other side it's like a canyon effect so the amplification of the sound of the exploding exhaust and it's not from speeding they purposely go slow and make their cars explode exhausts and the noise level is horrendous absolutely horrendous in fact because of this one thing and there's another another apartment for sale over there across the road I noticed the other day it's it's going on some nights till 11 12 1 o'clock in the morning and it's not just friday and saturday nights it's sometimes weekday nights so I haven't helped the people who've got young babies and children that live in apartments around here because they would be flat out getting them to sleep so I just wanted to say it's very important that these if you don't live in this area you wouldn't be aware if you don't live in this street you wouldn't be aware of the noise level of those exploding exhausts it's unbelievable okay thank you miss smith for sharing um that information with us thank you very much okay thank you all right as there are no more speakers on this item we will now deal with it so there is a motion before us is there a mover and a seconder so mover is councillor douglas secondary and second uh and a mover and a seconder to the motion is there any discussion councillor douglas yes can you uh so this motion is simply to ask council to do a report into a community consultation on the hooning I've consulted with the director of city futures on this proposal bayside as you know is a herning hotspot and we heard it in the mayoral minutes I have personally been contacted by thousands of residents about this issue and that was before I was a counsellor bayside council has not done a community-wide consultation on this issue to date whilst police might have data about the incidents they are clearly not acting on it enough and police are just a band-aid we need long-term solutions like the councils have done in london in potts point and the council of city of logan in queensland I have your say for bayside residents will enable bayside council for the first time to get a comprehensive snapshot of the issues where they are their severity and what ideas residents have for solutions this will enable two-way communication with our residents on you thank you councillor douglas is there any further discussion okay sure just very quickly um look I'd speak in favor of the motion um I think this is great idea um I think we should definitely set up a have your say as soon as possible and start collecting that data in a systematic way um so that we can proceed to take as much action as we as a as a council can on this issue any further discussion there being no further discussion I put the motion on the screen um therefore all those in favor say is it therefore all those in favor say aye against I declare the motion carried we now move on to I item 10.10 which is the notice of motion in relation to the noise camera trial we've seen received one written submission for this item which has been distributed to councillors from a missed out speaking for the motion in addition we have four people registered to speak um so if I um could please remind speakers um to limit your selves to three minutes and please um speaker I invite is mr anderson who is speaking for the motion thank you very much that's noted mr anderson no long wishes to speak I now invite mrs butler who is speaking for the motion to speak hello hello mrs butler please go ahead okay well all right well I just wanted to say that I support the use of noise cameras in bay street and I'd also wonder if they're going to put any in the grand parade just perhaps to the north of the nova chair or to the south because that's when they sort of accelerate when they take off from the lights I'm sort of happy that the council is considering the possibility of noise cameras anyway I stayed at the nova chill recently and I was on the 11th floor I found it you know when I opened the the doors just to go out on the balcony that it was so deafening that I had to step back inside so I know it's a it's a real problem and even now the density of the traffic'm standing on my veranda but I think mainly it's motorbikes at rev and backfiring them so um I do support that view that they're going to um they're going to do something about it it's much better than having the police in sort of sporadically just to pull them over every now and again and then they go back to doing what they're doing so I just wanted to say that thank you very much thank you mrs butler and um you know I i think it's important to note this um smart camera trial that is occurring in that vicinity that was just mentioned as well all right thank you thank you very much thank you bye-bye hi um I now invite miss campbell um resident speaking for the motion hello hello hello miss campbell we can barely hear you so perhaps if you could just okay can you hear me now that's better thank you please go ahead are you there yes I am yeah please go ahead so good evening um can you hear me yes we can thank thank you for the opportunity to speak um I'm I'm speaking in support of motion 10.10 I speak as a resident of brighton lee sands and also a committee member of bayside community incorporated firstly I'd like to congratulate the council on the decision and action taken for the installation of the smart technology cameras there's no doubt that these are going to have a positive impact on our community I'd like to speak about a couple of concerns and gaps that I believe the noise cameras may solve and understand that this solution would firstly be subject to a decision being made in favor of the motion for the report for a report being prepared and examine the suggest solution in detail as I understand that the current smart cameras that have just been installed are reliant on community to report hooning and anti-social behaviour some of the anti-social behavior and hearing occurs in the evening when families are trying to sleep a member of the community or business needs to keep a record of the date and time this occurs and contact the people for them for most people is to try and get back to sleep and business owners are usually trying to look after their patrons rather than trying to keep a record of when this occurs I'd also like to to understand how or comment on how effective the current cameras will be when there are vehicles or motorbikes sitting in traffic or at traffic lights revving their engines to the extreme or a car or bike going down bay street revving but staying within the speed limit I have a video of a car with a crackle tuning going down bay street but if the sound is turned down the image just clearly shows a car driving down the base for down bay street as normal I observed the vehicle proceeding down bay street it scared people who were walking down the footpath as it sounded like gunfire how are the cameras going to pick this up and the same can be said with bikes revving done sitting in car parks outside businesses disturbing their patrons it's unpleasant to sit outside any business in brightly sands and losing control one of the main issues for businesses is noise and if I'm correct and my consumption assumption as previous as we mentioned is the cameras and will not pick up audio therefore one of the main reasons will not be one of the main issues will not be addressed and businesses will continue to suffer some businesses that are new to bay street are regretting their decision to open or move can I ask you miss miss campbell to um give a closing remark because time limits okay um I think um yeah I understand that a review of the current legislation would be required I'd like to think that bayside council would be take a proactive approach working with different authorities for a positive outcome by voting favorably for this motion for a report and to examine the potential use of the noise cameras I believe it would give clear positive messages to message to residents and businesses that the council is serious about addressing this issue which has a major major impact on many residents quality of life and livelihood success of all the the council is the effort that the council are putting in thank you again may um madam mayor and the councillors for the opportunity to speak to this motion thank you miss campbell for joining us and sharing that information thank you I now invite mr burton speaking for the motion good evening uh madam mayor and fellow councillors um I am in favor of the motion I believe we need this noise cameras because as our current enforcement exists the police do not believe noise is a police issue they do they say they do not have the resources or equipment or training and they say it is an epa matter the epa send out warning notices so if we have noise cameras that would actually mean that the police could actually catch offenders I also believe that the police have done a very poor almost non-existent job of enforcing the current laws the only law enforcement on bay street late at night tends to be for left turns not actually for anybody hooning I think the council can only do so much and I applaud all the efforts the local police to enforce uh and and be active late at night particularly on the weekends when most of this hooning activity occurs and I think council should also press new south wales police to get the equipment and training required and I think we should also press the new south wales government because as has been mentioned previously this issue of exploding exhausts which is now called crackle tuning that is something that motor vehicle owners are doing deliberately in ever increasing numbers it uh in australia we already have very generous noise limits on noisy vehicles we allow 96 decibels the uk only allows 74 decibels so we already allow extremely loud vehicles but the people that we have got in our neighborhood literally deafening terrifyingly loud and I applaud all your efforts and I vote in favor of you passing this motion thank you mr burton thanks for joining us tonight there are no more speakers on this item so we will now deal with the item there is a motion before us is there a mover and a seconder councillor douglas do you wish to seconder to the motion um council werner seconder I have a mover and a seconder to the motion is there any discussion um councillor saranovsky emulation some of the issues that have been raised by the speakers will be addressed in another notice of motion uh I don't have a problem out of me um in relation to the noise camera but we need to first of all establish and I'm that's it serious that this is not a council responsibility it is not a council responsibility so those that are watching on facebook should please accept the fact this is not a council responsibility um it's not this council based our council and also rockdale council and botany council have been working in harmony with the police and the residents for a number of years what's happening down in brighton is um is um cartoons that are taking advantage of the resources of the police that we have at cochrane but I'll talk about that another on another motion but the critical issue is I do not want the resonance to be misguided enforceable at the moment I'm advised they're not they're not the noise cameras that she said I said what are they saying I swear sorry noise so it's just it's been they are not so when I'm moving the member so everybody's clear that before this council based our council goes into the process of getting information gathering information talking to people overseas I'm sure there'll be australian companies that do the the noise canvas we need to find out from the state government what is law because if it's not forcible it's a waste of time installing these um cameras now what I'm moving is that as a matter of urgency we write to the minister of local government asking their guidance and feedback to reference to existing pro or proposed state legislations that relate to noise camera noise cameras anywhere in new south wales on it I have no issues of installing it but we've got to make sure there's an expenditure that this council will pay I don't see the state government a few guns when we get to my notice emotion I'll be very scavenging on both parties are on it but we need as a matter of urgency to find out if it's law if it's not law then we stop thank you councillor saronoski so we have an amendment there so the amended motion um would you mind just reading the amended motion for the purposes of what's over there we've got we'll put the amended motion up on the screen we have a seconder for the amended motion counselor sooners so we'll just wait for the amendment to come up um and then um discussion would you like to speak to the amendment thanks uh madam chief so we had a lot around the campaign trail a few months ago everyone making pledges about auntie hooning auntie this auntie that I'm I'm totally support all of that I totally support all the rhetoric we've gone out there talking about getting cameras that do these cameras do that and as calvin stella salvonovsky tells us quite clearly and eloquently's no point having him it's nice to be able to see who's done what but if you can't take it it's not admissible in court it can't bring an offender up before any authority to discuss any matter and they're useless I get the fact that there's a lot of cameras around the place that actually identify people that might have broken done physical damage to buildings or property and so on we can deal with it and that's there's mechanisms in place for that within legislation but in terms of these cameras to identify two cars that are side by side and say okay who's the who who's driving past the hoon who knows I can't I can't qualify or quantify that in any way shape or form the other thing I was going to suggest and I've suggested this in the past is we've got to get our own house in order in terms of what we do down at down at brighton there's no ranges after five o'clock or can ask the director of city life what time their ranges clock off on a saturday afternoon but I know for a fact I've been down there my family orders pizza down there fairly often we go and pick it up or they get delivered we see cars that are parked in front of the rsl they shouldn't be parked that's a taxi zone no one cares they parked there all the time and the cars were talking about isn't a mercedes or a camry or something it's these lift of cars you can see them there in the candy apple colors they just sit there uh windows open the guys hanging around no one bothers them let's look across let's be very specific let's look across the road in front of novotel front of the roller shutter right in front of that there's the occasional lamborghini or some other car that wants to park there I'm a big shot I can park there no one bothers me then let's go across the road onto the grand parade there signposted clearly signposted yet we have cars parked there in the park there all night no one bothers them so we have to get our house in order or get the police to come out occasionally and just scare these people off a bit we don't do anything nothing happens it's very easy I i don't know we have after our rangers that do these things that they can go and book people but let's explore it let's explore it for a few weeks let's pay some overtime and actually go and physically walk up and down bay street everyone hasn't parked properly book them start sending messages don't wait for a camera to tell us that oh that guy's noisy or that guy's whatever it was those terms that some people use today that's great I understand that cars are fast cars are noisy you buy a car you flick a switch it turns off it lowers the exhaust down to half it increases the exhaust up by 50 and it hits this 96 decibels I write it to be the other thing is we as a council have limited enforceability if a truck parks in a local street we can book it after an hour but if it's driving down a three tons uh a limited three-time street we can't go near it we cut we wave to the guy and it keeps on going we have no authority we have no authority in booking anyone or infringing anyone on a traffic related matter the people double park they stop in front of crossings that's a parking related issue we can address it now my suggestion is that maybe we can explore all these cameras we can explore everything that everyone else is doing but let's get our house in order let's get the ranges down there more often trailer for two weeks we've tried people on the beach walking around telling people to throw out their their rubbish in the bin let's let's try this for a month let's get the rangers down there anyone who's parked illegally in there and it's not just one their cars they don't care the responsible family person will not park in and no stopping these guys just leave it there yeah it's okay trafalgar street all over the place all you need to do is go down there if council is willing let's go on a saturday night let's go down there have some pizza and let's see all the illegal activity we'll talk about it but who's been down there lately you're in you're out thanks okay so I support the motion um but as of the amendment as well but the motion itself it's got a lot of merit it's got it's got some a lot more so a one of a bit a lot of a lot of it's got to do a lot more traveling before it gets to become what it needs to be because there's a lot of elements that need to gel before it becomes something that we can actually actually say to authorities here's the is the image of mr joe bloggs driving this car radio's been up his car's been doing whatever please book them and whatever the epa does after that that's fine but surely the police can find having illegal works done there on their cars there's some modifications that you can really pick up on so if police don't want to do it they don't care that's another matter that needs to be addressed in a different forum thank you so thank you madam chair thank you council sooners are there any uh yeah yes I'm madame I'm going to speak in support of the amendment um sorry councillors I haven't prepared any puns on this one but that's the way that the notice emotion sits at the moment it seems to indicate to the community that there is an expectation that council staff will be able to sit there and review footage so I'm in support of that this amendment because I'd really like the clarification on the legislation and I think that will then sort of impact on whether the community has an expectation that staff review of footage so that's all I wanted to add to it thank you councillor jansen any other councillor werner yeah um I'd like to um speak for the motion um I think this I think that this uh amendment actually comes under uh number one um of the motion which um is a report and remember this motion is only a report so to prepare a report and um a report into the legislative framework in new south wales that's number one in that motion so the the amendment is actually contained in that number one uh item of of this motion so I actually think that um the amendment uh and especially if this amendment is instead of the original motion I can't support it because um that actually then means the the motion lapses so um can I just clarify that the amendment is additional to the motion or is instead of the amendment is instead of instead of okay well in which case yeah I just want to reiterate that that um amendment is actually I believe part of um 0.1 which so um so that that would actually give us that the motion itself would give us that thank you councillor werner any other speakers um councillor naji thank you madame uh through you to the gm or to the appropriate director knowing that this notice of motion have we done any preliminary enquiries to see whether it's legal or it's enforceable or whether it's legislated thanks thank you I'll ask the gm to respond um through the mayor the advice that we've received to date is that the current legislation in new south wales does not support the issuing of fines or penalties in relation to the noise cameras at this time thank you madam mayor I think I've just solved the uh the the riddle or the it's it's pretty straightforward and I think it'll be a waste in my opinion uh of time to go down a path inquiring further if we know these are the true facts of the legal side of things and I think it'll be a waste of time from our offices to take favor of dealing with hurling we've been doing that since 2004. now whether it's hooning whether it's cars backfiring and that relates to committing a traffic offense committing an epa with the backfiring and so on and it at one stage when this council communicated with the new south wales police we had the local command and and credit to the previous meds and I'm not going to mention them all they've all had that relationship with the local police all when and it worked when they had highway patrol saturated highway patrol and at some stages made of me they've had a blitz where they've had about five six cars pulling over all these cars that were hot yeah they used to pull them over and go through see if anything complies or doesn't comply and you know what it did it worked for a while they started going somewhere else they didn't come down broader but we just need to work with the police and be consistent be consistent communicating because the only enforcement agency in this issue dealing can pull over a car and book them for an infringement or been hearing or doing anything now just a quick background of my background people think I'm only good at cooking chickens and and fried chips I was an owner of a major security company which I was proud of for over 30 years and our expertise were in the electronics and cameras are state of the art these days and they're the one of the main tools that the police rely on for evidence now I want to take you through memory lane to councillors who were on this council when we were taken to a control room in brighton above kohl's we've got a state-of-the-art control room for the cameras that we're all over and my concern was then if we are not monitoring this 24 hours having a licensed security guard watching these cameras and when an incident occurs picks up the fun and call police straight away police radio they act and go on now the only way that these cameras have been effective is when someone a resident or retrieve that incident give it to the police police view it and if a crime has been committed or a traffic incident they can issue a fine or take someone to court that's all now and I understand the spirit of the motion by councillor douglas but if it's not legal and it's not legislated we are wasting time really let's concentrate and all of us how we can improve in dealing with hurning are much better to lessen the impact on the residents but believe you me if we don't get the new satellite police on board with us nothing is going to be done ill only because you can have speed cameras you can you have red light cameras and if people are going to commit a crime they do and they get picked up and they get uh issued with a fine you cannot stop hurning hundred percent but what we could do is work with the new south wales police to make sure that their presence their highway patrol is in the area at certain time when we give them a or a sunday night to go out there and start issuing fines to the people who do the wrong thing thank you thank you council naji and I think I just um if I refer councillors back to the mayoral minute about smart camera the smart camera trial where we actually look at um forming a um a hooning working party which will be led by um steve camper the mp for rockdale and that will be um that will have the police it will have community and I think that is a really positive way forward all right um can I just can I just add something madam here certainly council cedric thank you look I think this is a great initiative um and I commend councillor douglas and I and I commend the speakers noise is a major issue down at brighton especially sandringham san souzi ramsgate we all know this we all want to solve it and we've tried our best to do this noise and hooning is the number one issue as we all know I've got a bit of a different spin on mentioned we've spent and invested a lot in these new lpr smart cameras now I believe if these cameras aren't working um and then then we need to look at something else and this might be the solution but at the moment what we have in front of us we've just gone out to the community over and over again we've just had channel 9 report on us saying we've got these lpr smart cameras I think we've got to give that an opportunity to either work or not work and there's a subsequent motion looking at that success and to your uh motion ma to your merrell minute uh madame the other issue is that we've got this working group now which I think is a great initiative and if these smart cameras aren't working then this might be a place for that to be brought to the floor especially if it's led by steve camp or the state mp and since this is potentially a state issue so maybe to add to council sabranovsky's motion or amended council right to the minister of local government and uh our state member steve camper to look at this further and if he wants to bring it to the working group that's maybe something going forward if he doesn't thank you thank you council cedric are you happy to add that to the motion uh madame regrettably I've given it a lot of consideration but as you have previously said in terms of the merrill minute uh no I respectfully thank you for your suggestion I did give it a lot of consideration and um no but while I'm on my feet man can we include what council sooner said I don't want to affect the our staff our rangers lifestyle or I don't want to force them to work overtime but if we can look at something maybe on trial basis to get the ranges maybe pay them over time or time will whatever it's just something if we can look into that yeah thank you thank you councillor saronoski we can look at doing some blitzes down there and random random counselor douglas hi um yeah look I just want to be clear that um there are noise cameras already in bull and gone and cross harbor so I'd like to see in writing that um information which is uh whether and because my legal advice has been that this this is possible um I consulted with the director of city futures mr barbara about this and I asked him what the best way forward was and he suggested doing a background report into the use of this tech um you're just um counsellor douglas sorry to interrupt you you're breaking up again okay I will hold my microphone closer to my mouth so I have consulted with the director of city futures mr barbara about this and the idea is that we are just to do a background report into the use of this technology in london and check if there is legislative ability to implement it here and then if that's possible look at possible funding sources so it's really doing you know what we're all talking about it's it's just severity of this issue for residents I'm just asking council to enable this report to be done to investigate what is a proven solution now it's not I'm just gonna go the idea of a couple of blitzes I'm sorry that's a band-aid as well hooning is a massive noise pollution issue for our residents backfiring extreme deceleration acceleration crackle tuning which is the addition of illegal aftermarket add-ons to make exhaust sound like gunshots it's not speed it's not running red lights it's extreme noise pollution made by deliberate public nuisance driving and it keeps our residents awake it disturbs and destroys businesses and customer relationships it's creating stress and anxiety and it's not an issue that we have alone it's in london at the royal borough of kensington and chelsea where they had the same issues they trialled the noise cameras and they worked so they have rolled them out wildly even more successfully the way that it works is the noise camera is automatically triggered by sounds above a certain decibel the camera records five seconds officers who review the footage and see if it is public nuisance driving incidents of public uses driving are then sent to police to charge road rule 291 in new south wales requires that a person must not stop a vehicle or drive in a way that makes unnecessary noise or smoke this noise camera unlike the lpr camera does not rely on community reporting it means police don't need to be on the ground nor do rangers because we know policing and ranger resourcing is limited and as soon as they leave a site the hoons return so these specific noise cameras have worked so well in london that they're now in paris and new york and the next stop could be bayside resident for bayside residents given the severity of this issue I really do ask council to really seriously think about what the impact of knocking this back is it's not a big cost for council to do an internal report compared to the cost of not acting on this issue for residents mental and physical health and the cost to local businesses and you thank you madam mayor with the indulgence of councillor sarah vanowsky and I know he's a tough customer um but I think hopefully we might be able to suggest something that helps us move forward with this um I would like to see some action taken on this tonight I totally agree with councillor douglas douglas noise is its own issue um an lpr camera it can't hear it's not going to solve noise issues I'm afraid councillor cedric um and we do need to take separate action on it I believe unfortunately from my understanding the current legislative scheme is totally inadequate for dealing with this it's written in a bygone era it almost sounds like it was written by somebody who's who's parking in one of councillor soonest is duked of cars outside of pride and rsl in the in the protection of the environment operations noise control regulation um what it makes it illegal to do is a person must not cause or permit a motor vehicle to be used on a road or road related area if the excess of the level specified blah blah blah blah it's not even illegal to emit the noise it's illegal to have a car that can emit the noise it's an unworkable scheme the police have a big problem with it and a big part of the reason the next part of this of why this doesn't doesn't work at the moment and this should be changed and we should be supporting its change by the state government is to determine the maximum noise level for the purposes of this regulation of a motor bus a car a motorcycle a lorry I haven't heard that term in a while um it's to be determined in accordance with the national stationary exhaust noise test procedures now if you go to the national whatever it is um the test method for all vehicles the microphone position the microphone should be directed towards the orifice of the exhaust outlet and you'll be supported by a tripod or similar device not providing excessive acoustic reflection that doesn't really describe a noise camera unfortunately and it is a vehicle in excess of the of the allowed amount and council um as the local authority that has the power to deal with noise generally should practically be able to do this we need change from the government um so what I would suggest is um with councillor savannah's indulgence is that we make it very clear that we write to the minister of local government and we write for the minister of the environment who makes this regulation and requests legislative change to allow us to operate these noise cameras and I'm sure everyone's seen the the noise camera signs on mount oosley road and the fact that that's still up and not operating is just a joke um so I think we need change I think this is we need to support change to the um to the regulations um so that council can actually take action on lawyers thank you councilman do you accept that amendment all right then um you have the right of reply counselor saranovsky no all right thank you therefore I put the motion all those in the aye against declare it carried all right we now no if it's an amended motion we vote on the amended motion yeah all right we're going to move to the reports now I appreciate that um you know this is our first we haven't had a meeting for a while so and we've given you know a good opportunity to hear from residents tonight and um take on board in the interests of time councillors I'm um we'll try and move quite quickly through the following items um so I encourage you um only if you um really have um something that you want to add um that way yes so we'll start with um we'll start with we'll start with eight point one um cook park claim a grant for the management so moved by oh madame I just had a question if okay on that one we have to so I have a mover and um secondary you had a question sorry madam mayor um just a question through you to the director of city futures um can there for the community to sort of recognize the benefits of those coastal dunes so that was that was my only question whether that's possible I'm through you met a mayor it's not part of the the grant scheme and the proposal that that we put in um it's something that we could look at separately but it's not part of that particular project it's not within the scope but um we can then um look at it for investigation and and potential grants to to add to it okay if I can just in our last term that we we agreed uh there is there is a a modest emotion that was passed that all park renovation rejuvenation like that includes some sort of interpretive signage whether that be a small pocket park or a major major playground there has to be something there which could be something about the history of the site indigenous heritage whatever it might be and that is actually existing requirement for all um park upgrades uh in bayside thank you councilman morrissey any other speakers council I just grant because on one of the councils that went down there when we saw the trees that were chainsawed down and you could see all the trails going down through all the bushes and they were gonna there's no way that I don't know when they did it but it had to be done during the day daylight hours so I'm just congratulations and hopefully we can fence it all off and protect those beautiful trees yes definitely thank you councillor barlow any other speakers all right there being no other speakers all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried move on to two eight point two is the infrastructure contributions reform so it's account it's a submission that council made is there a mover just make a sense that we need vice council saranovsky and seconded by councillor morrissey I think we should um uh write to um all our mps whether in the lower house and the upper house make them aware of our submission and um we write to um um the minor parties the greens um shooters parties this if the government forces this through it's got major ramifications for local government and it's important that um we try and I mean we sort of stopped them last year but uh I don't have much faith in um when we're up against um the bureaucracy the state government in terms of money uh it's important I think that we at least bring out all our mps lower upper house and the other minor parties because if we're going to kill it he attempts we'll have to be in this in the upper house because that's the only hope that we would have because the global party that I represent we don't have the numbers in the lower house but with the support of the minor parties in the upper house we might be able to something there because I have spoken to the the opposition spokesman for planning and local government late last year and he's indicated to us that he's very sympathetic to local government and the thing that they were a bit upset about was we all know is straight out the window but I think if we can add those um at least get them on board yep thank you councillor saranovsky so we add a number three which is the council rights to um all the people that are listed there so members of parliament in both houses oh okay just the bayside ones yeah yeah there's already a letter it was on file before christmas from mark latham or whatever he is a brilliant letter yeah all right yes we can put it in the portal think that's a good idea thank you all right um I put the motion all those in favor say aye against I declare it carried we now move on to 8.3 8.3 is another submission this one is in relation to the terminals bulk liquid storage expansion which is in friendship road and sim blistered at port botany so we have a recommendation before us is a remover and secondary our move to councillor janssen second councilor morrissey is there any discussion no discussion only just to point out to council there that this join right on the boundary of ward 1 which is bayside there is significant gaps in the information provided in terms of the environmental management of that site and I can I want to congratulate the the the detail provided or acknowledge the detail and the questions addressed and asked of of uh the powers that be in the submission because there's a lot of gaps and if the gaps aren't addressed it is going to invent it's going to impact uh our local community so it's a very even though it's not in lga it's something that uh we really need to get behind thank you thank you council morrissey any further discussion no I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now move to item 8.4 um that's moved by councillor morrissey seconded by councillor awada um is there any discussion council morrissey thanks madam mayor I have um I believe that I wanted to make an alternative recommendation just to provide a little bit more clarity and remove any any vagaries which is governance so the the original motion talks about um determining an appropriate committee structure now I know there's been a number of conversations uh around the council group and therefore I'm recommending that or moving that we have city services planning environment works and asset works and assets and corporate performance which aligns directly with our directorates therefore the committees will uh fall underneath each of those uh directorates with each director therefore having accountability for those for those for those committees and the delivery of any actions taken um just to just to be clear as well is that this is just we're not um uh appointing anyone to committees that's why we've put that's why we're suggesting there that the 23rd of february is that we prepare draft charter terms of reference etc so if this motion if this recommendation passes tonight there's time for everyone to consider their positions and talk about that prior to the next meeting which has already been called for the 23rd also number three there that just to talk about just just to make that we're recommending that each committee must uh consist of seven councillors to be appointed at the york jordanian meeting next time um is there a fourth is there a fourth one yeah no okay I wanted to add number four that public um public that the public be invited and there'd be a public forum at each of the committees and that will launch that will be aligned with the existing code of meeting practice so the intention is for the committees to be running um under these directorates the public and then there'll be a published agenda similar to the similar to how we operate these meetings the public will be invited to speak whatever they're for against whatever they will be captured in the minutes and then from that committee will then come to the council for endorsement so they're an advisory committee but it gives transparency to all councillors despite the fact there's going to be seven councillors like all our other committees anyone's invited to attend and speak uh the commit the public will be able to speak again this is a public a public uh meeting and they can speak again although I would hope that most people would exercise common sense and if they've spoken at a committee and uh their concerns and their voice has been minuted that that will be in the business papers for all of us to consider it is they are advisory committees and that number five is at the timetable uh outlined in the existing report be it be uh adopted as well which is uh it's something that's a new it's a change of the operating rhythm for the council and it's talking about what what happens on wednesdays basically so the committee there's two nights for committees one night for for the meeting that the the the normal meeting that we have uh as as we are having tonight and then uh weeks four oh sorry I can't remember what weeks but to uh the other week for information sessions as as needed um and they can be called on our court basis thank you council morrissey do I have a there any speakers counseling yeah madam mayor thanks um I just wanted to um clarify if uh if we're also voting on when the committee meetings are like are they going to be one after the other or are they going to be um on at the same time concurrently yeah just through you madam chair it's what whatever is recommending the report counselor werner is what I'm suggesting that we proceed with um noting that if this is new if it doesn't work we as a group we can decide to reshare doing the interest of fairness and everyone's availability council morrissey did you want to add that as an additional point it's it's in there as point uh do we get that time tone number five excellent it's there on the screen so that the timetable any further discussion all right counselor hannah thank you madam mayor look I have some I suppose I would describe them as reservations about this but the the reservations arise out of probably me not properly understanding how this is going to work and one to admit that quite clearly I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but the way I like to look at these things is I i take what I call a helicopter view and I look down on them and I think right how is this going to improve the efficiency and the delivery of services to our residents and rate players now local government as you know is at the bottom of the food chain local government is bound by rules regulations legislation mandatory statutory requirements and reporting and I'm only guessing but I reckon it probably takes up 30 percent of the time of council staff just meeting these statutory obligations these things are imposed upon us local government is not known for being nimble local government is bound up by this stuff and when I get in this helicopter and look down I hover down to the level of this and I've got to say that I see another layer I it throws off sarah lee layer upon layer and I wonder why we're imposing upon ourselves more committees now I'm this could work extremely well I really don't know I suppose you know if it's going to come back with more information maybe I'm going to be a bit more enlightened but I really do like looking at these things from the point of view is how do we get from point a to point b to deliver the services and the facilities to the residents and rate payers in the most efficient manner having regard to the backdrop of all that imposed legislation that already consumes an enormous amount of time so at this point in time I've got to say that I'm not convinced about this that's just the way I feel about it and I just I just can't see at this point how it's going to actually improve the efficiency of delivering those services to the right player thank you madame thank you counselor hannah and I think you know some of the feedback we've received you know from communities around that that transparency and community wanting to be engaged and to hear what's going on provides that information is is certainly um what what's been raised with um with myself and and other councillors as well so is there any other speakers all right just um you know he did speak to us about the committees and I thought well I've got to wait and see what I can see in the report as a second longest serving councillor in this chamber I have been through many ups and downs of whatever with committees when I was first elected we had a building committee because we looked at all the da's we had a city services committee finance committee was a committee of the whole we had council meetings at the first and fifth first and third wednesday of the month but when we came to the general briefings and the workshops well that was really the best way to go because everyone in this room if they chose to come to the gm briefings that they're called now certain people didn't come to any they won't turn up at committee meetings I'm pretty sure they won't looked at this and I thought well I'd like to be on that committee and that committee they are running concurrently I believe so I can't_''_12130.319 be on that committee in that committee so how do you work out how do you become fully informed if you're not at one of the committees that is that you're going backwards actually you might think you're going forwards maybe I've been here too long but I have seen how it works the best way was what we just had okay the public can't come because we had very informal discussions we could actually discuss a lot of issues you can't discuss in a public forum and to have someone come to a committee meeting they can talk I can bet bottom dollar they'll be here at the council meeting saying exactly the same thing you cannot stop them coming to a council meeting you can stop them at a committee meeting by not allowing them to come so you're going to have they're going to have two bites at the cherry realize oh you beauty I'll be here and I'll come to the meeting then I'll come to the council meeting so you're gonna hear and you you can't stop them coming you can't stop them coming and talking you can't even say to them you can't say what you said a week ago unless you put it in I don't think you can even actually stop that because it's a different forum so I'm saying that I cannot support this in its current form I've spoken to people at sutherland someone that was a council that was here was elected with me in 95 so I spoke to him today he's fine there was a labor council then he was an independent and that was a liberal so he went oh this yes and they have their committees and they they actually can go to every single committee but it's all I think it's all on the one night but I think you've got a shock that I rang him I thought well I arthur lincoln so he said this works reasonably well but it is after each other but to run committees on the same night at the same time you are restricting every single person in this room of being fully informed and that's the local government we have to be fully informed so to me I thought the julian briefings our workshops way back when were a much better forum for everyone in this room to be fully informed so at the moment if that's that they're going to run on the same night you're actually restricting everyone in this room so at the moment I can't support the way it is but it's disappointing and I'm very disappointing because I saw the report and they weren't allowing speakers on the committee meetings you've just just changed it so it's up to you you you've got the numbers so I know that it's going to go through but I've had my say no thank you councillor and um you know and I think allowing people the opportunity to and um so council and argentina thank you madam I'll be as brief as possible I have two issues and it's fine having all these committees just two issues and maybe councillor morrissey can clarify how it's going to work the two issues I have the public forum I don't have a problem I mean the public can attend but when they're able to speak at the committee and be able to speak at the extra order at the council meeting that is a bit too much that's only my opinion not that I doubt whether it's going to be any different but I don't have a problem for attending both the committees and that but maybe a restriction and not a restriction having just keeping the public forum in the council meeting that maybe can be sorted out the only other issue that I have if let's say I nominate city services and city uh I haven't got city planning I've been got more glasses on but anyway and I happen to be running concurrently I would have to the other or whether it's city services to city works and they're both going concurrently that disadvantages me as a counselor to be informed so I don't know maybe you know we can think about how we're going to run these weather and I know we're thinking about timing it might be a long night he's having one committee then the second one or maybe go through the nominations and if we're able to ensure that one person isn't on the same so I don't know this is the issue how we're going to run them concurrently where a counselor may be on both of them yeah I i think you make a good point so how about I suggest that um between now and the extraordinary meeting councillors nominate their their preferent their um two top preferences and then let's look at um let's look at how that plays out and then if it if there's no clashes um or or then we can potentially look at the the consideration we'd have to have is a public forum and it's and it's live streamed that if you advertise a starting point um you've got to start at that particular you've got to start it at that point and if one the first one finishes early then people are sitting around waiting for the next one because it can't start till the advertised time but we why don't we have some discussions over the next two weeks and see um how everyone you know what people are interested in and and we can work it out from there all right and I'll just make a suggestion um if it's decided not to have uh public speakers at the um committee meetings then at least I think they should be live streamed because um they will be counsellor earner okay it's a requirement yeah excellent thank you thank you I've got councillor douglas who's been waiting thank you madam mayor uh can you hear me um I i do want to say I do have reservations about this because we can't all be properly committees are running concurrently at best we can only be briefed as councils on half the issues and I question whether it even meets the code of meeting conduct regulation which says councillors must be well informed I also have to say if we are to adopt these internal committees we really need a fair and equitable way for the selection of the committees thank you thank you councillor douglas councillor cedric uh miss madame I also share some of these concerns uh especially what council abalo mentioned uh through you if maybe the general manager or council of morris you could answer this um is there a reason why we went from the previous um scenario and info session or gm briefings to this what are the main differences um overall and is this in your opinion more positive or what are the what are the key positive outcomes so what um what this allows for by having committee meetings that means that there are reports that are published those reports are then available the same as a council meeting they're published a few days before they're the moment if I went and asked what do we do you know for example if someone's interested in what we do in youth services and senior programs so that would be an example where there are reports provided to to the committee meetings that are then that then informs the public of all the things that are happening because currently there is no there's not an avenue to do that and and we get that misconception again that we're not doing anything such as in relation to climate such as into noi um into licensed recognition so it's about keeping the community informed and then if there's questions around particular matters we can refer to the community the community to the publication and say look here's the report so it's a published document that provides all the information there it also is an opportunity for all counsellors to read all the reports and become informed about what's actually going on if there is something that you want addressed by council then that's the avenue to bring it to council to then write a report for the committee meeting so that then the councils are informed again around what's currently happening what's planned and then can put recommendations for consideration to the full council so all those briefings all those committee meetings will be live streamed um by sound and um can and can also be listened to by counsellors at a later date but I'm happy to look at how how you know what counselors are interested if um you know if there is a real desire for for counselors that want to go to four committee meetings then we can look at um arranging that structure so it's you know at the end of the day it's um but from experience and and I know we have a new term of council but there's um attendance was quite low at um a number of things so if there's you know when councillors are really interested in something can be really focused on a couple of committees that they really have an interest in but could still go to the next room and then go and listen to it and speak to it so there's no restrictions there another question for you thank you for that um what about if uh more than if we have 15 councillors wanting the one committee what happens there what's the process now 15 well they said there's only seven well what we well what we said was well let's look at what comes let's have a look at where people's interests lie first so we'll send out something in the next um in you know this week in a few days give people time to reflect and have a look at what's incorporated and then um you know and then if it is that there is interest well maybe that one all 15 councillors can attend and can speak so you don't have to be on a committee do you no you can yes that's optional you can attend and oh no you don't need to be on one you don't volunteer for any committee you don't have to come okay yep I once in my 26 years I think 27 I will not be fully informed at each council thank you council balak mr madame I'll be quick uh we've got four committees there for example the sports and rec committee where is it going to go under are we going to have the opportunity to know about where the the other is going to fall in before we can nominate yeah so um if in the actual council report it um under each of those it yeah it outlines all the different areas so for example sport rec is in city services so it gives counselors an indication of the type of topics um and and reports and look if it um you know for the interests of you know if we if we want to um spread them out and that they occur individually and everyone can attend all four that's fine I'm it's all right so um sorry I have already spoken I'm just wondering whenever you're able to add something else a quick point counsellor hannah I do this is just this because I think it's highly bureaucratic and it's adding a hell of a lot more stuff but about having said that um is there any way that we could maybe put a a date and make this you know when it comes in on on a trial basis maybe till the end of the year perhaps or something that's something counselors can consider out there I'm really very concerned I don't want council to get constipated by committees no I want a nimble council that can actually deliver to the residents you know what what are we aiming for here are we aiming to get all these committees we want to spit stuff out the other end so you know I'm not convinced about it but I really do think that maybe put it if we can put a date on it at least I've got something on the horizon thank you but if we can have it on a yearly basis to be reviewed it would be great yeah and we can consider those things and then when the terms of'm going to put the motion um so all those in favor against declare it carried called it division I'll just wait for division all right councillor morrissey council musket councillor faddel councillor janssen councillor naji councillor saranovsky councillor soonis councillor werner councilwater council barlow council hannah councillor douglas against councillor mcdougall councillor cedric thank you I declare I got to vote for sorry um so I declare the motion carried all right let's move to um 8.6 the quarterly budget review oh sorry I think it's it's getting late just trying to put my glasses on all right um 8.5 thank you councillors code of meeting practice um do I have there's a recommendation do I have a mover move counselor nargie second councillor um any discussion I i have an amendment that I'd like to raise please can you hear me thanks yes thank you councillor douglas um I remove an amendment that the officer recommendation be adopted subject to clause 1111 of the model code being included with the additional words added to that clause being or otherwise the words unanimous it's all voting at council meetings including meetings that are closed to the public be recorded in the minutes of meetings with the names of the councillors who voted for and against each motion or amendment including the use of the casting vote being recorded or otherwise the words unanimously being recorded when all voting is the same as we heard during our induction about 50 of councils in new south wales do this procedure where they record all votes for and against without a division being called and I think is really important for the transparency of our minutes and for our community that they have the option to review the minutes uh no matter how old they are the recordings that are made online are only needing to be there for 12 months and to actually wade through hours and hours of footage to find out how your local councillor voted on issues is just not possible for most residents it's a small thing that we can do to create more transparency and trust with our local community that at any stage in the weeks following which way their council voted on every issue okay thank you councillor douglas um councillor naji yeah uh should have sorry I need a sorry councillor naji so I need a secondar to councillor douglas's amendment um second council of barlow um councillor madame the code of meeting practice and and with the experience that we've had since 2004 whether the mayor at the time cheering the meeting calls the meeting whether unanimous or not there's an opportunity for every councillor to ask for a division and there's also an opportunity for any counsellor that objecting to the notice of motion that was passed to say that can I have my name recorded against it so I can't see what is the issue here and I'm not going to change things in the code of practice to suit counselors that are going to grandstand with the community the community are intelligent enough to watch on live stream the community is intelligent enough to know how their counselors vote and the community is intelligent enough to vote for them at the election or to vote community or not our meeting code of meeting practice has the mechanism to indicate to the council to the community how their council is voted and you can do that correct me if I'm wrong but I i think I'll be in support of the councillor's recommendation thank you thank you council naji council mauricio I'll join um council voting I think if you're saying against the amendment all right so um to to to council and nudgy's point everyone as it's happened tonight you call a division it takes a minute and it's done we don't have to we don't have to reinvent the wheel we've talked about our transparency in the last in the last uh item which is you know public forum at committee meetings it's not about it it's just about the efficiency efficient running of meeting quite often we've got these reports uh and and and sometimes there's debate a lot of the time there's not I think uh there's no need to change it and therefore I if that fails I will be supporting the recommendation thank you all right thank you councillors well I i put the um amended the amendment there so um all those in favor of the amendment say aye we need to we need to go through the process first all those in favor say aye again would you like to call it would you like to call a call a division we shall call a division so this is on the amendment so um for or against the amendment council morrissey against council musket against council fidel against councillor janssen against councillor nargi councillor saronoski council of tsunas council werner councillor wider council barlow mcdougall councillor cedric I declare the amendment lost I now put the and myself I am against um I now um I declare the amendment lost I now put the original motion all those in favor the original motion say I against declare it carriage all right 8.6 councillors quarterly budget review statement um move councilor barlow second council sooners um any discussion then I'll put it all those in favor say aye against declare government new south wales annual conference this is the nomination for voting delegates um there is an opportunity for nine voting delegates um I will take norman I will is there a mover and a seconder to the motion move council anarchy second and council councillor jansen um I will now take dom nominations off the floor um so any um nomination from councillor werner any further nominations councillor douglas would like to attend councillor douglas thank you councillor mcdougall councillor barlow I know it's very challenging due to work commitment that a number of councillors I know would love to attend but due to work commitments during the week it's very difficult to attend so therefore oh did she want to attend well there's enough spots so she cannot um so we'll have to know before we move the bookings because there will be a cost curve if you pull out so um within the week by the end of the week okay so all right so then um I put it that the um councillors the councillors named on there um be nominated as conference all those in favor say aye sure if in the body of the report uh those councils that had actually nominated if they don't turn up they will be paying for the cost of that conference exactly in the report yes okay thank you thank you council wider yes um all right all those in favor aye against the cleric carried um we now move to the waste conference so um do I have a mover and a second food counselor water second council saranovsky um is there thank you so again I i know I'm I'm gonna go this year because you recommend it all the time and I think so what I'll do counsellors again I shall take recommendations off the floor so um we might just go around the room because I think there's quite a bit of interest again if you commit to going and you you don't go then you are responsible for um paying for it councilor morrissey councillor musket council fidel councillor jansen can I just confirm this is um one that we could participate in so no okay counselor naji yes councillors um council souness yes councillor werner yes no councillor barlow yes council cedric will confirm councillor douglas no sorry I can't attend thank you all right um and I will go I will nominate too please all right so um okay I think councillor douglas said she wasn't going oh she

declare it carried all right let's go um so we have notices of motion we have 10.1 notice the motion requests for ministerial visit to bayside grand parade brighton forest road and stoney creek road bexley councillor saronoski thank you madam mayor I'll be very very brief I could go on for hours and hours and hours in relation to this but I won't uh madame the intention of this is simply to ask the government the minister of the crown our representatives in government irrespective what political party are is to show us the courtesy to turn up and see firsthand firsthand the situation if I can year and this is I I'm not I'm not going to be political but we got notified 10 minutes before the turning of the saw the m6 in um uh down at bicentennial park that the premier was going to be there we'll give them 10 minutes but they don't have the time to come to brighton and see firsthand what's going on in terms of the carhoons and we've been pushing forward blocked our council and baseball council has been pushing for a number of years to put up red light cameras split cameras um in bay street grand parade and according to the government they don't believe it's a high priority they don't believe in high priority now as one of the as the elder statesmen on the council might have met a number of years ago I can't remember mostly before the money there was problems down in brighton and what happened was and this is the intention of my notice emotion was the minister at the time was michael costa the police minister he came out of the police to regularly patrol and prosecute and confiscate the cars now um the police at montgomery chicago are doing an excellent job but it's basically the resources and it needs the ministerial direction because councillor douglas I want to thank her she sent me 2020 november an email from the bureaucrats of new south wales transport that they believe street grand parade is a low priority it's not an urgent car thing this is and as I said when I spoke on the previous um noticed a motion about the noise camera this is not a responsibility of baseline council we have spent thousands of thousands of dollars I think we've got about 50 or 60 cameras in bay street and around brighton uh on it it's not our responsibility it's a police well I go to brighton but I mean at least twice a week and I see firsthand what's going on it's a it's a and I shouldn't say this but it's it's a fatality waiting to occur with these cartoons there is a 40 actually see the signs there's a dummy photo of a split camera at one of the shops well it doesn't exist there's a 40 car 40k zone no one polices it from bruce street I sorry from duke street to um um something on the street um brewster it might be gordon street there's no one hand no left hand turn monday saturday sunday well guess what nobody polices it we gave the police a number of parking spots opposite novato we gave them opposite the restaurants the police do a tremendous job but it's once in a blue moon uh madam and this is simple things that we've got to get the minister to come down and see firsthand not during the day um our local member steve campbell he had a petition a few years ago and he got minister grant um to come down and see firsthand and then it died down then all of a sudden they just exploded it is a crisis happening in brighton every weekend at least I'm there on a friday or sunday on the car that's it there was a car that turned right from grand parade into bay street and clipped one of the um bolas that we have if a bottle wasn't there there would be a fatality and I understand the police are doing touring to a tremendous job but they need the resources they need the government to come down and see firsthand because I'm not going to be political the labor parties that fall too on it that we've got the current situation that we've got here because when the labour party sold the party that I belong to and I'm proud to be a member they sold the police station at rocktown so and I went and saw the commander I saw the police minister and we were assured the people of rockdale at the time that we were going to get a mobile police station guess where we got it from from botany it was a publicity stone I've got the media release that frank sardo issued and said it is great that we have lobbied hard for a mobile we had it once it's a photoshoot it's from botany thank you for botany supply oh man sorry masquerade that was it we never saw it again and I spoke to the minister kelly at the time it was a mobile police I never saw it and then um and I was embarrassed because we were sure at the time the councils of rockdale that by closing the police station at rockdale there was going to be more foot patrols well that never could never occurred a former member of rockdale john flowers campaigned to reopen the police station well that figures it out we had a problem with the jet skis around that time rocked our council donated five thousand dollars from uh for a buggy uh police but buggy beachbody we only saw it once I was there frank saddle was there and further normally was there and that was to overcome the issues of the jessica's well we only saw it once never saw it again the member for rockdale mr camp refused years ago did a petition he got 10 000 people who saying is asking the previous minister constance apparently he visits brighton now but he didn't have the courtesy to come down and see it firsthand to see it firsthand that's what we're asking and to give a direction to say this is a fatality going to occur here people's businesses lives I've seen the hoons from cars I've seen them with the motorbikes on show I fear I fear for someone of a talented curve and and that's all I'm asking is that they come down through our member and ask them to come not during the day not at breakfast but actually come down and all it is is half an hour of their time they go in their comcast up and down grand parade uh to go and open some liberal party pool that they funded and we missed out you know um so I'm asking them to come at least come and show us the courtesy we've got the same rights as the liberal seats we're all human beings we'll pay our taxes that's constance at all didn't come at all and then I move on to um and my motion is to invite the police minister and the minister for transport we might get a better hearing now in relation to sonic roads we all know what's happening with the m5 that is an absolute disgrace what's happening it should actually be a royal commission in in into this uh madame we have been hammered left right and center because as the older statesman here it sounds good when they built the end fire we'll give an assurance is that the traffic would decrease so great forest road mexi road they all said it's going to happen we went through the charade the public consultation when they said we're gonna do the clearways and we're supposed to be a review on the info again we wrote to minister constance and said please come out and see it firsthand again that's a I i pray to god that nothing ever happens but there's been a couple of accidents there with the semi-trailers one one and the bank up of car at trucks on forest road stony creek road people on forest road are suicidal because they can't sleep or not because it's 24 hours a day trucks are bypassing the toll the the the unfair tax my greatest fear is um is um on the intersection of mars street and with spotless street they've already got the gadget ready to install the toll that's the next one and and all I'm asking is the um that we invite the minister through mr camper and ask him to say come down and see first hand now we've had the media channel 9 channel 7 have all done stories on it uh we've had the leader of the opposition chris mitch it's going to be the next premiere um he's been down there he's sympathetic basically prophetic in our situation and all we're asking is um is to get a fair hearing to set firsthand um in terms of the m5 title I don't think they're going to do anything because they've already sure what the extra the the part of it and and any conclusion madame um when it first opened the m5 and I love telling this story bob carr before premier said son this will never be told well guess what they got told they saw me son I was young boy then but um I won't say anymore because it is fairly late at night at 11 o'clock but that's my pure intention is to um to to try it's a new council new ministers they might show a bit of heart and come out and see it firsthand no thank you for the motion so that was known by councillor saranovsky and secondly when I typed in transport minister I went there's a lady called natalie ward she is the metropolitan transport minister they actually divided it all up so she needs to go on the list and rob stokes was but he's now I just looked it up now but maybe rob stokes as well but this natalie ward is actually listed as the metropolitan transport minister so she needs to upper house whatever and it may be rob stokes because he's in infrastructure as and pedestrian safety so I'd just like to add those tour to it as well and definitely they've been asked more than once about 10 times I'd say but anyway hopefully we do a scatter gun effect and maybe we'll get one thank you council bala so we've added those additional ministers all right eddie for the discussion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried here councillor mcdougall yeah sorry I didn't say that loud enough um all right um we've got now 10.2 which is um the notice of motion heritage grant funding program so um moved by councillor saranovsky seconded he's only going for another point by councillor barlow I had an amendment first yeah or maybe or maybe council sarah might hear the amendment I was just going to suggest a 0.3 so there's no alteration to the actual motion that I was going to add at 0.3 that council reinstate the annual house of the year awards covering several additions counselor sarah I'm sorry I've piggybacked in on this because when I saw the rest of it I thought well hang on this is this is related and that's something that council used to do so um oh yeah I've got no problems if I thank council hannah for it look it's important to ask for us to preserve the heritage and the streetscape of our area our city as I got older I got more I got um more wiser and less cranky um and I've and I was talking to council below yeah I've seen the right I mean there's one opposite of house I saw where there is home has been fully renovated tastefully uh and kept the facade of the um of the house even my house I've had twice with my wife I actually wanted to say there's a lot lead like windows and she wanted removed and changed the ceilings that but no seriously I would the last one when we had the council directions I was I had no one helping me a letterbox and I just sort of looked at fast food and gibson and that sort of footwear maybe if we can push the people the residents along um to us saddle look there's a grant maybe you know um restore the particularly the front of the house and particularly with the cover situation you may recall madame I put the introduced the um notice motion last year or company all the year before but we we didn't charge da fees and that was encouraging people to sort of while they're at home to sort of start thinking about renovating and stimulating the economy same again you know with this heritage grant was to get maybe that might prompt someone to fix the facade of their property um they might be encouraging the facade or defence and I did forget thank you council I have in relation to the um ruined statement of the house a year because in terms of um uh it's it's if you know your house is the house of the years you're actually very proud of it you know um preserve the the the the history of the area so um I'm sure we'll get adopted so thank you council saranovsky um councillor naji thank you madam mayor look I'm all for uh heritage and the heritage grant uh funding I just want to clarification through you now these grants would only apply to existing heritage houses is that correct and I'll explain why where people could take advantage of the situation some might defer to general manager um through the mayor so the intention is to bring the detail of the policy to the next council meeting but um we have in the draft that we're developing it does apply to items that are on the current local heritage register so you have to have a that status on the property the building before you would be eligible to apply okay that's great to hear because what I'm trying to avoid is I have a residence in my ward where the grants were in the past I think they were around a thousand dollars he listed his house to be on asked this council and I was one of them and I'm sure a few other councillors were asked the council to unleash that night I don't want that opportunity for any residents okay to use that as a a grant given to improve the house and when the grants are stopped in the past in the future if it does then unless they think so if it only applies to existing listed heritage I'm all for it that's good okay um sorry um just online what the gentleman said can we look at also the um uh if we still come back council the conservation areas for example um yeah like not just only heritage listed but um conservation uh areas that um um but also if we're in a conservation area that we've identified some councils have a two-tier system so there's a slightly higher monetary rate that applies to individual heritage items that are applied for funding and if you have a property that contributes to a heritage conservation zone and you're in that zone you can apply but it had a question in regards to the house of the year awards um I have some concerns about that because as a new councillor I know nothing about that previous program um to me that's just been added to the notice tonight um so preferably I'd like a little bit more information about that um if that's being added to the motion yeah so um are you happy for that to be that'll come back as a report so that counselors can be informed about what what that looks like all right um I know for the discussion I put the motion um all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now move on to 10.3 which is um update on traffic management for bayside using license plate recognition smart technology to reduce hooning and anti-social behaviour through our council cedric seconded by councillor mcdougall uh any speakers I'd love to speak please um councillor douglas I have an amendment for this um the council conducts a community awareness campaign to enable residents to know how these lpr cameras work and in nuisance incidents that can then be followed up by council and police by by reviewing footage captured on the lpr cameras counseling food in this community action campaign how these public usage driving incidents should be better I'm sorry council I'm sorry counselor yes I can't hear you oh sorry I do you don't want me to start from the beginning do you from the beginning you've already submitted it okay it's on the screen that's fine so counselors can see there's an amendment um that's been put on the screen do I have a seconder for the amendment um so councillors said cedric and mcdougall have indicated that they accept the amendment into the original motion so therefore I put the original motion with the amendment in it as per the screen um any further discussion um thank you madam I'll just be really brief just quickly um again this is dedicated to councillor james mc mcdonald in regards to what he's done and the residence of those areas and same with the general manager there is a of illegal activity that has been made uh I've been made aware of and I think the last point other than trying to concentrate on combating hoons and antisocial behavior and I guess part of the second point is also updating residents on the progress and we want to know basically how how it's going but the last point there point four is that um and I really want everyone's support on that one is that council seeks support from the state member and the state government in funding expansion of this and further projects if this is successful and we get that information back that we look at um getting the state government involved further thank you thank you council cedra any other speakers I i put the can I put the motion just just quickly uh look it seems when you're looking at facebook okay uh it seems like there's a two four between uh two councillors in a certain ward let me assure this council let me assure this council and the community that are listening and and watching this live stream invest in a project of that kind of any other kind that the officers always prepare a report and comes back to councillors and given that advice so after that it becomes public and it goes to the community I just can't believe it I just can't believe that this is up that knowing that the staff is going to do that anyway but I'll support it there's no problem but I just hope this facebook turf war doesn't continue and provide extra unnecessary work which the staff we're going to do it and put more pressure on the staff that's all thank you thank you council naji all right I put I put the motion all those in favor say aye against declare it carried we now move to motion um 10.4 which is support um for investigating the greek festival returning to bayside in 2022 I moved by council saranovsky seconded by councillor mcdougall not too much on it but I just wanted to add a couple things if I could in relation to point two um I just wanted to party with council officers and also the organisers of the greek festival and also um council councillors um yeah two three councils to be honored um I the when I did it um um was that um that we set up a a working party what I was looking for because what needs to happen is that um um and we're going to include the state member because if we need to go to the government then we need steve to be sorry mr campbell to be um in the loop because um as elder statesmen um when when the greek festival was on in brighton it just changed the whole character of the area and they're the ones that came approached you and said look we want to bring it back to brighton um and um and that's why I just wanted to uh I've got no problems with the staff but I think if we can have like a mechanism when we do meet also when the council meets the organizers that at least we're the councils so uh are in attendance to be there and any other council of council students wants to be there and then we invite um mr camper in case wherever the location is going to be we'll need to have um quick decisions uh in relation to because um he's in base strip whether it happens I don't know but they've put a submission into the state government and the federal government for funding uh and it's a great opportunity like as when I remember as a child going to rockdale astro bay street it's just the stalls the concerts they had was unique you know it actually brought new people into the area parking was a problem but um uh if we can sort of by the elected councils bring that on and also uh would suggest you madame to be there like it just gives them a bit more confidence to know there's elected councils there we're willing to work with them um and that um where it's humanly possible to smash down walls or barriers because that is what the community is looking for down having carhoons you know anti-social behavior and that's what this this is when they were in brighton uh it was a buzz like um and all the shopkeepers all donated sponsored events and it was just a real cultural festival and and and the reason I say that we don't have barriers is that this event is only one day could be two years or for a weekend all this is one day so what I don't want is I don't want to be negative that they come to council and all of a sudden we put all these walls up because particularly I can just sort of just put it on the table we have closed bay street and grand parades with fireworks we closed the street for the world cup I was there when greece won the world cup no european sorry that's so much when when um bob carr was actually picked up and carried through up he was actually picked up and he was carried over to brighton along the bay street that's what happened I was there so all if we are committed in bringing it back I'm not you know trying to give a direction but if we really want them to come back then we should be saying to them let's work together let's go and see mr camper let's go and see the state government and get funding on it this might not even cost the council any money so that's that's the idea uh on it so but we need to include mr kampa yep thank you yeah thank you councillor saranovsky all right I i moved it um is is there any count what we might do council saranovsky is if any councils would like to nominate to be on that working party off the floor now yeah councillor cedric councillor mcdougall councillor soonest councillor serenoskin council jackson any others douglas councillor douglas thank you thank you one of the councils all right and that's why I'm very supportive of this motion anything to boost brian thank you I know it's late um I put the motion all those in favor say aye against the the change in closing procedure for car park gates located at the eastern end of sunone avenue where the club is so um moved by councillor cedric seconded by councillor mcdougall I don't think that I think there's a mention that the club is in administration um well not not technically they're looking for an amalgamation but I think I think in the body of that motion in the explanatory bit I don't think that's the case so that may maybe they are looking pretty good we might want to amend that I don't believe they're in administration they're merging with the iraq catholic club yeah I haven't gone into administration all right well councillor cedric you want to speak speak to your motion just to be quick I've got some amendments um well I've asked thank you councillor douglas um councillor cedric will speak to him just weary of time thank you madam mayor I would like to move another point point two um if the 16 foot sane club fails in its obligation to close the sononi other gates in the in the lga miss madame mayor this is quite simple there was an obligation by the club to close this gate like many gates in in foreshore they're not closing it it's a major issue there are illegal activity that's happening down this neck of the woods we need to get on it um the the people of the area the residents have called out for this numerous times and only uh yesterday or the day before that we have police there at 11 00 p.m and 12 a.m um for anti-social behavior all we're asking for here guys is to close the gates and um to improve the greater security by improve on locking system at the moment it's insufficient they're getting grinders and cutting off the locks we need to invest in something a little bit better um similar to what we've done in other areas and I i employ everyone to uh support this and then councillor mcdougall will add to it councilman thank you madam mayor um I completely support this motion um you know need to do something about it and make sure that car park is being closed um I'd just like to add point five that um we identify this area for the installation of our next round of lpr cameras um as I think this is a pruning hotspot and this will really help and it's an appropriate location for further expansion of those yeah you accept that good suggestion I'm councillor douglas I've got other amendments there as well please can we discuss those um have you sent those amendments yeah yeah they're on the screen I think if lauren scrolls down these have come about because I've been doing community consultation on this issue as well so these consultations uh led to these additional amendments which I also checked with council staff around feasibility uh the council gate to be fixed and maintained if damaged again council to open and shut the gate for the interim at a time determined by the council and club long term the club take back over shutting the gate if possible after negotiations with the club if in the public car park to aurora energy and that council install one of its mobile cctv cameras above the gate to capture attempts to damage the gates and one under the club to prevent drug dealing there thank you councillor douglas um all right madam mayor before we please ask the question sorry counselor uh before we run off can we just check who owns the car park because we're talking about okay so then then what we should be doing is right into the department of lands crowns bringing it to their attention because to the entrance to the car park I'm not sure whether it's council or uh the clubs because my understanding is um I've got to declare an interest actually not preferential because I actually opened the renovations like 30 years ago and there's a park there where the machines are but my understanding was just before we send it off yeah yeah before we send off can we just check who actually owns the car park the actual car park where the club is and the entrance to the interest in it so I'm not sure how we can be the policeman on a car park that we don't own so we're better off right into we're checking with the crowns bring it to their attention of this uh alleged situation now the club has apparently merged with the royal catholic club so um yeah I'm conscious of the okay no thank you yeah that's a that's a good suggestion um councillor douglas are you happy that um an amendment is that further um items be investigated that you've raised that can be are you happy to accept that further investigation be added to your amendment of course yeah totally I i think we've covered them in the original motion I'm happy for one line of that yes and that's what yeah they're not everything that um the matters raised um there on the screen or the that matters be investigated around who owns the land and also that the context may change if the club amalgamates then that changes the context so there's a few happy to um withdraw and have your um amendment considered as a further investigation section of the original motion uh no not really I mean this is all right in consultation with the community and this is what they want thank you councillor douglas um councillors I'm afraid councillor mcdougall you didn't give us enough time we now have to extend um a procedural we'll give you 20. 20. all right all right so moved councillor cedric second councillor fardel all those in favor against the cleric carried all right so we've got um we've got an amended motion so we'll put the amended motion um the amendment and the point is that this has spent a lot of time here all they had to do the residents just had to win a counsellor and the council should have just come straight to the council without all this waste and time yeah yeah all right so um since we've got time I've still got I haven't had to ask the question who's obligated to lock and unlock that gate mayor so council installed the gate and ultimately it is council's responsibility to open and close the gate in the same way we do with the other four shore gates however under the previous management of the club there was an agreement that they would lock the gate because they were concerned that either their patrons or their staff would be locked in because of the timing of when our security guard does the whole length of the gates that need to be um locked so I think that has somewhat come undone that arrangement because the management has changed because the club closed during covert there's been a disruption to that so we can put it on our security route to be ab to be done but the timing may present some difficulties for the club through you if that's an issue they could also have a key and they could let their staff out so I think we're trying to cover ourselves both ways yeah and we can further investigate well um therefore we have to put um the amendment um all those in need a second to thank you seconded council werner um so the amendment all those in favor say aye against declare it lost all right I now put the original motion which is um on the screen with some um with a couple of extra oh it's up there um all right I put the original um motion all those in favor against declare it carried all right we now move to um there's the second last oh the last motion um and then we've still got to go into confidential so if we can make this quick 10.8 notice the motion keep australia beautiful moved by council cedric second by councillor mcdougall any discussion I just wanted to propose one change with uh the the councillor cedric's agreement um to change number four that council oh it's up there councillor so rather than just give tube stock willy-nilly to any all and sundry that we actually have added to our event schedule one public tree planning event per award in this calendar year locations and dates to be recommended by council officers in consultation tree planning event we've had them in sir joseph banks park on mother's day for example you plant one in memoriam mother's day father's day whatever so we'll seek guidance but I think that's a better use of the tube stock and that that supports council's tree canopy approach all right you accept that amendment all right then item number three that's up there well the history of cleanup australia is that the council participates by going from big organized cleanup areas the big organized cleanup areas provide a barbecue where it was necessary undercover that's changed dramatically yes um I was involved in the one at ramsgate for a few years now and the council would come at a certain time we would have our own barbecue going and that would leave a few things and support us what we're doing leave bags and keep on going so the council has got a big presence into what's going on and I still don't understand what this thank you usable bags packed with a snack pack and water if you just come down to ramsgate so the economics haven't_''_16334.239 been done on this properly so the way it's worked in the past is terrific and I think we should just continue with the barbecue there's an actual if people don't know we've actually got a truck with a barbecue at the back of it drives around it unfolds its legs it does whatever it does yeah does the barbecue for now then that's that's perhaps we consider um that we also articulate where there is opportunities such as that um when we um put forward our calendar for keep australia beautiful and say that that's raised to clean up australia they have their sites and we can have access to that information yeah and they have cleanup australia during the week with the schools uh other commercial ones so there's a lot of activity around that weekend or the few days living leading into that weekend all right thank you I don't mind the barbecue idea that was the original concept in that covert came around so they yeah we can look at both options and and go from there all right all those in favor against declare it carried are there any um questions with notice yes madam mayor do you want me to read them um perhaps we'll take them as it's it's getting very loud I can read them quickly okay I know I'll hand them up after that I've actually provided a copy well maybe they can put them on the screen or is it hard copy okay that's all right no I didn't want to make it too easy for them um the management and lease of angelo and easter sequoia center expires in less than 12 months which will mark six years with the current operator could the general manager please advise what has been put in place to ensure a smooth transition for either renewal with a current contractor calling for tenders consideration of council running the facility or any other option that will ensure equitable access to the center by all who wish to use it given the current lease expires in

the street can the general manager please advise when these streets where a number of residents are elderly and cannot ambulate on uneven surfaces can look forward to construction on a footpath on one side of the street with particular attention but not limited to hanley avenue maynard avenue miller avenue middleton avenue and cannonbridge row from ellesley road to bexley road question three in caledonian street bexley there are two signs one of which is near the roundabout at dunmore street north indicating an australian government black spot program with the project managed by bayside

Well I formally declare the um public meeting of bayside city council open at 602 p.m I'll just start with some um well before I start I'd like to on behalf of bayside city council and on behalf of the panel acknowledge the traditional custodians of the lands on which we are all meeting tonight and to pay our respects to their elders past present and emerging just to start off with some um introductory comments about the purpose of the bayside planning panel the planning panel is charged with considering planning proposals of any scale and value and determining development applications where the value is less than 30 million dollars where there is a potential conflict of interest where there is contentious or sensitive development or where there is substantial departure from development standards council no longer considers these types of development and they are within the responsibility of the local planning panel in particular the panel must consider development applications which have attracted 10 or more unique objections in a public meeting and that's the reason that tonight's development application is before the panel outside of a public meeting and all decisions are published on council's website normally within seven days this public meeting is being recorded and is live streamed to council's youtube page the recording is an official record of council and may be made available to persons upon request in accordance with the freedom of information legislation applicants and members of the public that have registered to speak on an item will be asked to unmute their phone or computer at the relevant time to address the panel and to answer any questions alternatively members of the public may have registered for the meeting by making a written submission which has been provided to the panel members once the panel has heard from all of the speakers including the applicants we will either make a decision during the public meeting or adjourn to consider our decision and as previously mentioned all decisions of the panel will be on council's website within seven days before we commence our consideration of this development application the panel will introduce ourselves so I'll start my name is marcia domini and I is in the area of law and specifically planning law I've practiced as a lawyer for about 35 years and about 25 of those years has been spent practicing planning law I also have expertise in governance and public administration and I'm a member of a number of state government committees and a non-executive

planning thanks corrine thanks panel we do have no apologies and I'll ask the panel whether you have any disclosures of interest in relation to tonight tonight's development application I don't have any disclosures to make no disclosures thank you no disclosure from me thank you no disclosure thanks panel so that brings us to our development application for tonight which is um the address is 14 to 16 banksia avenue strathfield and it's a development application for a boarding house uh four storeys with 49 rooms the recommendation from the council planning staff is for refusal and we have a number of we have nobody registered made written submissions opposing the development application and uh we don't have anybody who is registered to speak um against or registered to speak on behalf of the applicant so if I can just explain for anybody who's listening um to the meeting or was watching the meeting the panel has attended the site and we've also read carefully the council assessment report and the accompanying material that came with that with that supported that the report referred to we will now adjourn the meeting and um discuss the development application and make a determination of the development application so that will either be we will refuse the development application or we will grant consent to the development application and there will be reasons for council's decision and they will also be placed on the council's website so I will with their no other business I'll declare the um meeting closed at 608 and just again reminder to anyone listening

We have joining us today senior environmental officer at bayside council ns rustic I will hand over to anna shortly to begin the session this is a really exciting project council has done a lot of work leading up to the concept design and now council is asking the community for their input to help further finalize the final concept design so that aligns with what the community wants environmental officer enes will provide a summary of the new south wales government 5 million tree initiatives stage 1 greening bay side and where we are now stage 2 cooling bay side we will then discuss the engagement side of the project how community input will impact the outcome and how to give your feedback on our have your say platform thank you venice oh ennis you're just on mute my apologies yes I'm back on um afternoon everyone thank you kelsey so the new south wales department of planning and environment has a goal to increase urban tree canopy across greater sydney region to 40 by 2030 and a range of initiatives are being used to achieve this what we're actually discussing here particularly around the stage one and stage two of the planting projects that council has invested other initiatives also includes the urban tree canopy strategy the council will be start engaging from next year onwards next slide please so the stage one was the green bay site where council has already planted 800 trees across the streets parks and open space and natural areas to create a sustainable livable local government area these trees will provide the long-term benefits by reducing urban heat improving air quality providing habitat and providing shapes to help communities stay active and connected this planting has occurred across saint susie kaima moscow's east gardens botany and hillsdale other areas also include some of the natural areas within bayside particularly down connecting the scarborough park and and further south to ascot park these areas were chosen as they currently have a low tree canopy coverage spectrum susceptible to increase urban tree urban heat during summer months the name of this program was to help increase the tree canopy and green cover across greater sydney by planting as together as slide please stage two is a cooling based site and that's where we are today next five minutes so the stage the cooling bay side is where we are looking to plant um 700 trees across across bayside streets to create a sustainable cool livable local government area basa council was specifically applying for this project aligning with existing strategic plans that we focus on particularly around improving a tree canopy cover reducing the urban heat island effects connected existing strategic active transport corridors with open space agreeing grids connected existing schools with strategic pedestrian network and focused on some suburbs with low tree canopy and height heat island effects that have not received trees in round one next slide apart from this initiatives number of councils will be will be considering applying for these grants and starting their own projects which is why our neighbouring our local government area george's river um government area has partnered with both sides as we share local government boundaries um while delivering support for each other to provide greater ship tree cover across lotto government areas both councils will be seeking carlton and kingsgrove in order to support each other's activities through enhancing green great connectivity as well as improving collective trade canopy cover and community outcomes all these suburbs fall under the lowest and the second lowest tree canopy cover ranking and heat island effect ranking developed by the department of planning and environments thank you thanks dennis um my name is kelsey I'm community engagement officer and I'll be joined by sharon mitchell the coordinator of community engagement at bayside council to discuss with you the community engagement side of the project and really understand what council will do with your feedback so right now we're at the stage of promoting the projects we want to see where you would like to see trees planted within the area that council has carefully selected using our interactive tree map which we'll show you how to use later in the session this information will actually help guide council and where to plant the trees to make sure that aligns with where you need them in november we will collect feedback using the interactive map data and popular locations that's been selected by camp by the community and then over the nexus will happen over the next couple of months so in the new year when we're back and fresh and ready council will send letters to the immediately impacted residents for a final opportunity to have their feedback uh sharon will now go through the have your say page how to use it and interactive map tool doing bayside hi everyone I'm sharon and I'm the coordinator of community engagement at bayside council um and yeah this is another great project that we've had the privilege of working on with ennis and um we worked with him previously on greening bayside which is another fantastic project um and calling bayside it's stage two and we've tried to lay it out very um simply as we always try to do on our pages so people can understand the project and so we just run through it there obviously we all know it's cool to live in baseline and we like to think this is going to make it even just outlined there at the top of the page um and then where we have the sort of underlying underlined words means you can click through to something else so there it talks about the 5 million tree initiative or actually we've gone to greening bayside but that'll take each each link takes you to some further information if you'd like to read about that so that takes you to the bigger picture project um when you click on on that link um and yeah and the other link is going yes sorry back to page one page one yeah so um so that's how we um outline the pages and what's happening now is we try to explain um kelsey's just run through that process and that that's kind of a little bit uh more detailed in the life cycle so at the moment we're at this very very first stage of stage one of this of this part of the project of stage two of the bigger project um and we've provided uh interactive map and I thought that tell us where they would like the trees or where they wouldn't like the trees um in fact because some people have feelings about that and and they don't want the trees and that's fine too and ernest will work with those people and we will um as kelsey outlined earlier we'll go through a series of opportunities for people to let us know these things as it progresses so if you click on any of the links here it'll take you down to the interactive tremor and this is it here and this is a great tool that we use quite a lot and we've um what we've done with this is it actually will pinpoint the address for us as well so when you're adding a pin we'll actually see the address of the place that you're dropping the pin on as well usually we don't do that you know we just sort of have it as a broader thing if it's in a park or something but with this we want to know specifically the and this would give us their address so um in the so if we could just go back for that map again I think yeah so what we do is we work with our mapping team and they give us different layers that we can layer over our our map and these are the areas that are in purple that are the overlay map which demonstrate which areas ennis would like to hear from people um and which ones that have been determined to have low tree canopy so you can see there some people have already added pins which is great I think there it says um two pins have been added on that spot there and if you zoom into that we might be able to see what people have said um okay so yes someone's added most of the trees along this block have been decimated by electricity company and then plant trees here so this is the kind of information that we are absolutely looking for from people who live in the area those kind of comments are gold for us because we you know on that um so yeah any what's that one say hamlet street queen street albert street really don't have any trees or is very sparse so there it's given us the exact address of where people uh would like or not like these trees so I think there's two options of pins isn't there kelsey there's a one there's so you can add a pin tree if you would like to train it doesn't have to be your address you could potentially put it somewhere else as well if you think this tree is going to be you know valuable or uh the no trees here please which I would presume you would put in your own address if that's what you desired so I think um yeah so once we collate that then we will move into another stage um which is outlined in the life cycle as well so all of that information will go to ennis and his team and they will sift through it and um move it to the next stage so if we just go previous one so greening bay side so you can link between projects so you can see what happened in the first stage I think that the map may still be there so you can still look at that um after we've done the interactive map it'll move into the life cycle there I think is popular locations identified so that's when ennis and his team will really drill down into what people have said um and as outlines there then there will also be I think it's two more opportunities to feedback to us um even following this stage so we're right at the very start so we'd love to hear from you if your neighbors um if your neighbors talk to your neighbors about it then maybe they don't know about it but um we'd love to hear from everybody and if you want to ask us a question directly um there's a question um box there and that will go to ennis as well so that will go direct to him and he will be able to respond to there how do we get here how do we identify those suburbs that are highlighted in purple on that map um so there's an explanation of how that how that occurred um and like I said if anyone would like to ask anna any more questions on that either now or through the q a chat availability um online that's great um and what does this question can I have yeah can I say about the trees in front of my yeah ennis um I thought it was a really interesting part of the project that people actually can be vocal if they don't want a tree and you the council is willing to work with them could you explain a little bit more about that so one of the lessons we've learned from a stage one project was the fact that we were looking to develop concept designs purely based on the information that we had but not necessarily all the information that we had from residents and how they felt about tricks so this time around we've learned the lessons of actually talking to for you guys to come back to us through have your site page or calling us or any other way so once we actually have a preliminary constant designs developed we will send you a one more official letter basically asking you can you please tell us if you haven't been part of this conversation tell us if you don't want the property so that we don't have to do a final stop ups and and final issues in in creating certainly creating a community harm because we want to work with residents to ensure that the trees are there where the residents want but not where they want them don't want them great thank you so what we also have and always have in our projects is a document library so for example we've got the species list so what you will see um 90 of the trees are going to be native which I think is amazing and um we've got the tree map which shows right now the level of canopy across bay side so red down here is zero the areas now that you're targeting is that right enos yeah that's correct so um all the areas that are highlighted in um red and orange are the areas that we considered for planting in stage two we've already um planted the stage one where they were already red so this is now opportunity to uh focus on the areas that we haven't focused on stage absolutely great and I'll go through here just to show you everyone's species list so um this is one of our first engagements online engagements that we'll be doing for the project hopefully we will be able to do another one of these online further down the track with more people engaged with more traction so we can have open discussion about this project and draw that feedback into the final concept design yes and like I said if anyone um if you could let your neighbors know or anyone if you're living in the area let people in your street know that this um opportunity to um talk to us about trees is available that'll see now if you'd like to go to some questions or I've got one question here um anna's which I'll put to you it says hi I'm wondering how council monitors and manages the risk of falling trees in branches so this is one of the areas where we're trying to improve our processes in and having a database on all these things I have been working with our parks and office space team to ensure that that's actually been happening we have the regular one-on-one uh we have regular uh group chats across the council and understanding what kind of issues people experience and how can we assure that any falling branches are actually been built directly and efficiently great thanks dennis um I've got a question here which is sort of more about trees on private property rather than than on council property but I'll ask you um what about the trees on private property and the loss that's happened over the last 20 to 30 years for granny flats I'm presuming they mean that people their granny flats um what do you have any comments on that in us or is that something absolutely yes yes definitely look up I'm I absolutely love the questions you just asked because this has been prevalent across sydney basin um that I've come across in many different areas bayside is particularly famous for for focusing on those those things as well and unfortunately this is an area that's that council has worked out in replacing that canopy that's been cut through um and that's why we are now working with the uh the partner planning uh across all our urban tree departments in ensuring that um there is actually increase of the canopy the sydney 5 million tree projects and initiatives would have come to those realizations as a result of these things happening for the last 20 30 years and and this has been a problem and I acknowledge that thanks are there any more questions sharing uh not yet if anyone has a question please push it through to us um and if I had a question for you that I mean when you talk about heat island and heat island effect what does that mean uh sharon who poland effect means essentially is that when you have the infrastructure that's been built on the lands and you have a general temperature differences between say coastal area and an area which has got high urban uh infrastructure the the the the urban infrastructure reflects the heat so all the concrete and all the buildings and all the streets they actually reflect it and make the area much hotter so ketone effect is essentially reflection of that heat that comes through the people actually feel it more than if they say on on on a bushland or in some park right okay that's great thank you for that thank you um um so with regard to I think um kelsey showed us that there's a list of the um species there so how how do you how did we get to that list and how do we select our trees what's important when you're selecting a tray to to go in this type of area so I verges and stuff so how do we make those selections um that's again another great question um I have spent a great deal of the last four months uh filtering through all the council's uh relevant documentation that have some sort of guidelines or mandates on what types of trade we can plant in particular I'm talking about these three tree master plants that former rockdale and former botnet councils have developed we also have the natural restoration area guidelines where some of those trees have been used and utilized and a couple of other documents when the councils have done their studies so we basically filtered all those trees through and then we've consulted our parks and open space team to assure that what is their experience that they're found with these trees and how they work in parks and office space and how they work in fridge tapes for example a particular tree may be suitable for streetscape but might not be so suitable for parking off space and vice versa so that's where we look at that and and we will of areas and the types of streets where the trees are going to go we will continue to filter that through and find the appropriate tree species that would actually go into those areas we certainly have no intention of planting a 20 minute tree next to the power lines because that's what's been done uh historically uh through a number of the legacies that other councils have experienced as well and how long does it take what sort of stage are the trees at when you put them in are they sort of very small sort of speedlings or are they kind of a little bit more mature trees yeah sharon the trees are essentially well focusing on planting 45 litre trees so the 45 litre trees are essentially uh I would say about uh maybe five to ten centimeters thick and maybe two to three meters tall so that's that's quite a good-sized um tree so definitely so do you did they have some I noticed in in where I live sometimes they put those little fence things around them does that is that people sometimes damage them or no the fences are usually put in as a result of keeping the stability of the tree particularly if you have the strong winds or if you have major flooding where the tree might be off rooted because of the shallow soils et cetera but I have I have had the discussions with parks and office spaces just recently and they've come up with some new innovative ideas on how they can actually put one up one stance that can hold the tray together not just having this fixed around it but that's that's still uh work in progress excellent oh well thank you very much ernest and um ernest's contact details are on the have your say page and that's his direct email address and or you can give him a call if you'd like to as well if you want to know anything else about this project or you can contact us in engagement yeah if if the issue is just purely around engagement and you want to find out if your thing has gone through or us a call as well so unless anyone online has got any more questions um I think we will finish up um and thank you so much yes for joining us today it's always thank you great to have you experts on the on the lunch and learn and I'll hand over to kelsey because I think she might have an idea about what's coming up in the future for tuesday talking bayside so thank you very much ennis thank you very much and thanks again and thanks for everyone that joined us today um as sharon said please do keep an eye out online for more upcoming talking bayside tuesday where we're going to dedicate that day to engagement projects so we can invite everyone who wants to have their say we can show you how to use the page and just give more detailed uh face-to-face virtual information about that and the links are in the chat so thank you to everyone have a really great afternoon and we'll see you next week and tomorrow we have a zumba class at 1pm thanks everyone goodbye
Okay I'm going to admit her hi everyone and thank you for joining us for today's talking bayside tuesday lunch and learn we're going to be talking about the cooling bankside project and we've also invited ns rustic the senior environmental officer to give us a summary of your feedback so far first I'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of bayside the category digital people of the euro nation the people of the euro nation their spirits and ancestors will always remain with our waterways and the land our mother earth I'd also like to acknowledge that I am today working on the land of the darul and gandangara peoples and I pay my respects to elders past present and emerging and we'd like to expand that extend that respect to wherever you are working from today as you'll notice you can use the chat button to leave comments or questions for our hosts and these questions can be addressed at the end of the presentation so I'm going to now hand over to senior environmental officer ernest rustic to will go through the coordinator of community coordinator of communications at bayside council to go through the have your say project and see all the feedback you've provided so far thank you ennis thank you kelsey um thanks very much everyone for all the feedback that you've sent so far um we've have had a variety types of feedback silver received um most of the feedback was related to the way we can actually plant the trees in the open space so parks and reserves in particularly um this is probably not the kind of feedback that we were looking uh but we do have a separate projects where they're looking to plant some trees within the parks and open space team so I'm able to pass the feedback on to them and there will be some greening or passing upper space within both sides we have received some valuable feedback on what are what trees that we can utilize within the region that's helping us out in determining which street routes are people using for transport hubs for you know walking to school be incorporating that feedback into our preliminary designs now during the preliminary designs we're looking to incorporate areas where we will go for the next stage of our consultation so kelsey can you put the next like list so our next stage is basically going to be a um sending out pamphlets to those areas that we are now focusing on planting our trees those pamphlets are basically going to be sent out to obviously all the communities in those areas but particularly we're looking to get the feedback from people who have haven't had a chance to either hear about our lunch and learn programs hear about our online presence and simply being able to look at the pamphlet and say right I want to ring my number is the number up and tell provide my feedback to myself on where the trees can go so we will be recording that feedback manually um there will be number of people who basically they have a very strong view of whether they want trees or they don't want trees so it's important that we record do provide a final design um we can actually then um exclude the people that don't want trees um most importantly once we have conducted the feedback with setting up the pamphlets and received further feedback from you and we're still seeking online feedback of course regarding what streets are using for your walkways what streets do you think require additional trees we will be sending out an official letters to every resident who is going to receive a tree in front of property so you're not going to find yourself in a situation where there is a person planting a tree in front of your property and you have good money about so we will be sending you official letter and we're saying from all the feedback we received you have been selected to receive a tree please email us or call us and tell us you don't want a tree or tell us um we want the particular tree now I know there's going to be some questions around what types of uh trees that we're going to be planting at information other than we're still going to be focusing on our favorite trees within the region such as tuckeroos red gums water gums and so on uh ivory curved trees as well um but we probably may be including some other types of natives that might go into your area which will be dictated by our council master plans so um once we receive the full feedback and we have plenty constant designs we're looking to do all the all the plantings starting from march and finishing up by the end of june so that's it from me now kelsey thank you thanks so much dennis uh charles hand over you now stop sharing my screen if you just want to show the feedback that we've received so far from the community using the interactive tool okay great I'll just give you one second and I'll share my screen with you oh so let me know when you can see it yep looks great can you see it now okay so this is um our cooling bay side have your save page so you go to have your say um so the project has been open now since the 22nd of october and we've had several one or a couple of lunch and learns and feedback will close not until january january 22 so it's just a simple explanation about the project here and the timeline the life cycle over here if you know someone that needs a hard copy or would like to input into this project we can also arrange for that to happen as well uh the species lists are in the document library if you want to know more about what sort of species some the ns was just briefly touching on um and there's a heat map there as well but the most important tool that we're using for this one is our tree planting map so what we do is we work with our mapping team and they provide us a overlay of areas that ns has identified for this round of tree planting and people can go in and add pins and we're really happy to have received a lot of pins in blue they're the areas that we're asking people to input on and these the amount of pins that have been dropped in specific areas so if you want to add a pin you just go here and press add pin and I can probably oh it's going to ask me to sign in but there's two pins you can add the trees yes please or no trees here please so if you have an objection to a tree being planted at the front of your property then you can just put that on there and it'll actually show us the address of the property and everything so that's a really helpful tool for us um you can ask a question so if you'd like to ask a question you can send a question through this portal as well so if you wanted and in us we'd send that across to ennis and he would happily answer all questions that are sent through so that's the have your say site um so I'll pass it back to ennis if you feedback or yeah look sharon um the the feedback I just mentioned quite quickly um it was basically related around the parks and open space um we're still looking to receive more feedback particularly around the street trees um so the idea is to understand your movements understand what streets are using where you're seeing irregular bare patches but very importantly we would also like to see feedback around the areas that already have a good tree cover and also missing some links as well there that we can actually incorporate it's much easier to provide a greener link in an area where there's there's more trees than than trying to start from scratch in in about bare areas so but any feedback is valuable um we want to hear from you we want to know how you utilize in our areas and and we will we will ensure that that's incorporated to our final design we do have a question here from cecilia about the yellow uh colored um dots on that map what that is showing is that uh the more comments lighter to kind of spark us to go oh we need to look here so there's a really popular area I think that was in bexley there was about 27 people dropping pins and then there was 19 just next to it so that's why they're yellow that's why they're yellow I hope that answers your question there's cecilia um if there's any more questions please drop them through otherwise I've left the link uh for have you say in the chat you're welcome and uh and it will be open over the holiday break it's going to be open until january 2022 so there's plenty of time for people to give their feedback and um contact ennis directly his number's on there as well and yeah I think that covers that for for this afternoon if anyone has anything else to add let me know okay all right well thank you so much for joining us today talking backside tuesday please check out the eventbrite page for upcoming projects and engagement projects we'll be presenting uh flag we have someone from the library team coming in talking about that thank you so much for joining us and have a great afternoon thanks guys thank you
Can I also say to you that the members of the panel have been to the sites have read the material that's been placed before them and of course read the council office's reports and recommendations before I start I'll introduce the panel that will be delivered on your matters today but before doing that can I ask everyone to please place your microphone on mute until you're speaking and then we'll call on you to unmute can I start by introducing myself as chair today my name's gary shields uh I'm a planner and urban designer for over 40 years um I've worked as a consultant and and in councils and I've also worked as a commissioner in the court um I'm also serving on other panels which I must say enjoy quite immensely can I introduce emma our community representative thank you gary yes I'm the community representative on today's panel um I currently reside in carleton I've been living in the bayside uh council area since 2007. my experience is also in architecture and manage the state design review panel as well so I'm pretty familiar with these panel processes thank you for having me today thank you judy thank you gary I'm a registered planner my name is judy clark I've got over 35 years experience in local government working as a town planner and I've worked for several councils managing development assessment I'm an expert member on some other panels I'm also a council appointed member of a regional panel and hi trader thank you gary thank you judy ladies and gentlemen the first item we have today is could I introduce myself gary oh I do apologize I'm sorry thank you my name is ross bonthon I'm an architect urban planner I was previously the principal architect and one of the directors for the lend lease group of companies for some 29 years and also served on the sydney city council from 1974 till 19 1991 when I was asked and appointed to establish the pit water council and subsequently was elected to the pit water council and have served on any number I'm still involved at the conceptual and strategic level for large-scale mixed-use projects in australia asia middle east india china etc and serving on several panels and committees thank you save the best for us thanks ross I do apologize again again ladies and gentlemen the first item that we have today is generate considerable amount of interest it's uh 1581 botany road botany and we've got a number of speakers that are listed to speak and I understand that michael daley who I can see on screen directly in front of me has another pressing commitment afterwards and it's asked if he can be elevated in the speaking order and mr daley it's uh we're happy to accede to your request so would you thank you very much for for that mr chairman and panel members I'm heading into the city to address a bunch of lawyers at seven o'clock I'd much rather continue talking to you but uh anyway um thank you very much uh for the work that you do this uh as you say mr chairman is of keeping with uh the local area and the local uh uh residents have made their feelings known can I just say that in in our neck of the woods in botany banks meadow and surrounding suburbs we're not nimbies we've been accepting increased populations increased heights increased densities increased business from the port from the airport and all of those things for not just years but decades and decades because we do realize that we are in a strategically important area of sydney and we do welcome the fact that those sorts of activities do bring economic activity that bring jobs to to our area when we don't mind that but the way that the area has grown up is being one where residents have had to co-exist with great pressures as I say there's surrounded by industry one of australia's busiest airports next to one of australia's busiest ports and the population of the bayside area in the south the old botany council area simply burgeons during the day the tens of thousands of workers that come in and we welcome them that that brings but what we've done over the years is to make sure that when the activities cease in the evening the neighborhood goes back to the residence so when I was a minister for rhodes I instituted a heavy vehicle ban no vehicles over 12 metres can come down botany road through botany and banks meadow shops we had the road resealed to make it quieter we drop the speed limit from 60 to 50 to make it quieter and we have resisted applications like the one that this committee refused and we thank you for 24 hour bp not far from this particular application because when all the workers go home during the day the the um suburb reverts to what it is a just a nice quiet neighborhood suburb and for all the reasons that the council outlined um and that your committee agreed with in respect of the bp increased noise um increased possibility of crime increased traffic um decreased safety um decreased loss of amenity all of the factors that attended that application are here but they're probably amplified um you see's is opened during the night there are young people looking for places to go they don't all go to the pub they'll come and get their food from mcdonald's and they'll sit in the car park with the radio going and the doors open and no one will be able to stop them from doing that so for the reasons that uh that council advanced um we ask I ask on behalf of the local residents that you make the same decision in regards to this application as you did in relation to the bp because this is worse its effects on the neighborhoods will be more amplified than bp uh and it's totally out of keeping with what is really after 10 pm a quiet residential neighborhood I've said enough now you've got plenty on the agenda but I really thank you for the opportunity to address you this afternoon thank you has the panel got any questions mr doni just agree 100 thank you mr duncan and good luck with your meeting thanks very much thanks for accommodating me pleasure's the next one I've got on the list is bennett are you there through you mr chair I think it's uh miss rachel thorton he's next there's miss thornton yeah I'm here thank you may I be king yes please you've got three minutes thank you thank you for allowing me to speak this evening I am one of the many affected families living in single-story dwellings directly opposite this site on behalf of hundreds of residents I would like to second the reasons for refusal made by bayside senior development assessment planner to date at least seven different professionals in their fields have deemed this d.a to be dangerous detrimental to the vision of the area traffic generating noise generating light generating crime generating and all-round impact generating for the community assessor one tf new south wales states that the da would increase traffic by up to 340 vehicles per hour and council notes this is an increase of up to 260 percent for traffic at this location assessor 2 council traffic advisory committee provided seven significant points as to why they traffic report states this development will only reduce road safety in the area and note six other issues four new south wales police deem it medium crime risk citing eight different crime risks five councils environmental health officers report stated support was still not provided and additionally the plan of management only controls a small portion of the noise and equipment from the proposal six an independent acoustic consultant stated the operation will give rise to adverse acoustic impact onto surrounding neighbours this is in addition to light spill and traffic movements seven council senior assessment planner notes amongst many other issues 17 individual points in the dcp this application does not meet there are no solutions to these issues particularly ones off-site which has been acknowledged by the applicant the site simply is not suitable for this type of operation or a mcdonald's of any kind the current surrounding dangers and impacts at this location must be taken into account council and panel denied bp petrol's application for 24 7 operation last month acknowledging the current dangers and impacts at this location this da has more issues experts surely reason can see this site is not appropriate this application proposes to take so much away our safety and our children's safety our village feel our trees our amenity due to our isolation on botany road our peaceful night times our clean streets and parks our ability to sit in our front rooms with the windows and blinds opened as our small businesses our sleep our parking no one business should be allowed to risk or impact a community this month in summary the applicant has had numerous opportunities to provide the adequate reports requested and while they have entire departments to submit da's they have failed to provide sufficient evidence to show they will not negatively impact us because the reality is they can't I asked this panel tonight in its important role this evening to consider the site holistically in relation to its surroundings to please confirm with the panel they have watched both videos I submitted as well consider how much impact and danger that already exists here and the stark contrast of peaceful night times approving this da would cause a hundreds of residents I implore you please refuse this application in full and protect our community botany does not want a mcdonald's here in any way shape or form thank you very much thank you for that very passionate address ms thornton oh thank you do I is it miss miss mack that I have next on the list are you with us it's mr I think we're working from a different list here which this mr huss yes good evening uh mr shields chair distinguished members of the panel and viewers I would like to further add to miss thornton's objection but and applaud miss angela lazaridis for compiling the report and endorse council's recommendation for refusal my name is huss challis I do a number of development applications on behalf of my company pinnacle design studio and have appeared before the bayside planning panel on a number of times mainly in support of my applications never on uh refusing but I really really really want to fight mr banform uh we miss uh chair madam chair jan morrell tonight I was hoping she case I really really wanna huh I said I'm sorry about that mr shields you'll have to do that's okay no I say that with all due respect I really really want to focus on in part 9b_''_801.68 of the bot new south precinct having been a local resident for the major my life part of my life and do a lot of applications that area the subject site is located between a transitional area between b7 and b4 mixed use and the zone while acknowledging that the land is zoned for this purpose I do share miss thornton's concerns that not enough boxes have been ticked and they cannot be resolved by way of having a fast food franchise there I also want to draw your attention to a recent case decided by commissioner clay mcdonald's australia vs wollongong city council which was determined on the 20th of october 2021 and the major reasons although the applicant was successful in that one was that the road network had to cater for the generated purposes of the mcdonald's franchise and that while we cannot refusal I think there is a number of contentious issues which cannot and have not been resolved by the applicant that being traffic and that being spillage and so on and so forth landscaping and the last thing I want to do I want to take up too much of your time is I don't think they have from an architectural perspective being sympathetic to the street safe character and maintain many of the surrounding and residential developments in the area and that is a big reason why I fall short and the last thing I want to touch on in terms of the building the setbacks do not comply the setbacks range from nil to 1.5 from the sides as such even though it is set back a great amount from botany road however it can not be denied that there will be a significant impact on the road network and mr daley touched on it previously and miss thornton spoke passionately about it and I just want to endorse council's recommendations for a refusal thank you thank you so much uh mr morrissey I can see you mr chair and panel members um as you're aware I'm a a ward one counsellor um so I'm speaking on behalf of residents here but also as an as a local resident I live within four to five hundred metres of the impacted site so um just just a few points I'd like to I'd like to make tonight that we had um the community has signed a petition containing a thousand and eighty signatures now they were compiled in 12 days had I had the opportunity to extend that over the recent election campaign we probably would have quadrupled that figure I'm sure because that was one of the number one issues that came came up as I was talking to residents it really demonstrates the community's feelings about this development as you're aware members there is 342 individual letters of objection and I think that that's probably unprecedented for this part of the world we have 10 or 15 from time to time from local streets this is 342 individual people who have taken the time out of local government engagement it's not that high at the best of time but this is something that is really really important um for the for the people of botany as they know the impacts that it's going to have as you as as the reports show there's a lot of traffic danger here there's no crossing of botany road within 200 meters there's no crossing on sir joseph bank street nor uh anywhere nearby now as you know um mcdonald's is a draw card we've got walkers runners we've got cyclists um I walk my dogs past there too a couple of times a day there's people with uh with the with um with the with the walkers elderly and there's young people in prams who live up in that pembina street area in that developments in wilson street and it's just simply too dangerous as you also know there's a bp bus stop directly sorry a bus stop directly at the front of the bp now there's constant traffic cues there's trucks including b doubles still have b doubles coming in illegally to this site and that causes immense danger people are drawn to will be drawn to cross from the bus stops to joseph bank street there is no safe access many of those people will be tr will be school children uh seeking to stop off at maccas before they before they walk the rest of their way home and it is they'll be like a moth to a flame and uh it's just really uh inappropriate there it's it's in with pro easy walk to joseph banks park as many on the call know that that park has ecological and historical significance there's no doubt that there's going to be environmental damage to that park through the excess rubbish that's generated typical typically in this in this style of development you see it littered all over the streets and that's well documented throughout any community where this occurs mcdonald's have made no commitment to clean up anywhere outside their boundaries nor have they made any commitment to clean up within their boundaries after workers which is fair enough but it is going to generate rubbish it's not fitting with the desired future character of of our suburb and it is not um not in keeping with our existing village feel as as mr daley alluded to at night everyone goes home we're back to the village and everyone accepts the status quo we thank the panel for recently refusing the bp 24 7. police had significant concerns with uh with that and I don't have to repeat those in this in this forum um but I think there's you know there's uh significant um there's significant impacts on our community and I'm speaking as I said not only on behalf of myself as a resident but on behalf of the nearly 1500 people who have taken the time to uh to voice their concerns here so uh thank you uh chair and and panel for your time thank you sir who have we got next on our list on your list for you mr chair mr simon payne mr simon payne would you there hello mr allowing me to speak with regard to the da uh which I oppose um I'll speak to seven aspects of the the traffic report which uh I feel are insufficient um firstly the sydra modeling the model has not been calibrated or validated so the presented impact of the development cannot be relied on to be accurate uh the traffic surveys undertaken for this work should have been should have recorded heavy vehicles and queue lengths to facilitate the calibration but no evidence of this has been presented the pmp exedra models appear to have used the wrong proportion of heavy vehicles from joseph banks street they've used 5 rather than the 25 percent that was agreed with transport for new south wales uh this is potentially a difference of ten right turning heavy vehicles in the one-hour peak so could well affect the results of the modeling secondly the assessment takes no account of future conditions botany and banks media are forecast to grow in population by 12 percent to 2041 and 25 to 2056. this will obviously increase background traffic and the intersections should have been the the assessment assumes 180 vehicles per hour uh which is generally on the low end of estimates and this hasn't been suitably justified the initial december 2020 traffic report used 230 vehicles per hour as a sensitivity test um as recommended by transport from new south wales but the latest report does not do this the latest report does reference the bitsios report from 2016. um figure 417 of that report shows average peak hour rates greater than 180 on each weekday in other sites in sydney and it's up to 270 on wednesday um so again the trip generation assumptions are not sufficiently robust um sensitivity testing hasn't been carried out and therefore the overall assessment cannot be considered robust either um fourthly the trip distribution um no justification has been provided for the distribution assumptions used and this is particularly important um because of the median strip and the routes people will have to take in and out of the site fifth the scope of the impact study the impact of heavy vehicles at the bp truck stop has not been assessed rachel thornton parking in no stopping zones which causes significant and consistent disruption in the area weekends mcdonald's often generates a lot of traffic at weekends but this has not been assessed and the road safety has not been assessed either sixth revised assessment provide proposes a central median the impacts of this median has not been assessed in particular the impact on residential streets caused by g-turning traffic uh seventh the central median also requires a loss of parking spaces on both sides of botany road demand for on street parking is significant in this area and the negative impact of this change on local residents and businesses has not been assessed so in summary there are a range of issues which have not been sufficiently addressed by the traffic report many of these issues were raised by council and transport of new south wales in their reviews and the updated report still does not address these concerns and the da should be refused as a result of this and all of the other issues that the other speakers have spoken to today thank you thank you mr pine mr a trump planner so I don't get involved in da's very often but I i have been around yes and and you've certainly done your homework thanks for your presentation no worries thank you for we mr chair the following two speakers are via the phone so I'll just call it just magically effectively thank you we still have them there ringing the number now you're plugged into the um the planning panel thank you very much am I able to start speaking thank you we hear from you thank you yes thank you for the opportunity for allowing me to speak tonight we are in favor and support the council's report to refuse this application we are local residents with a young family living directly opposite the application site there are so many areas that concern us and the community in regards this application having a mcdonald's across the road from my family and neighbours who are either raising young children of their own or who have grandkids over isn't something we ever thought would happen mcdonald's is a global or beaches or close to major event locations not on a road located within a residential community whilst botney road is considered a classified state road the botany south precinct in which this application is located is at the quiet end where the road is used mostly by local traffic going about their day-to-day business once the perpetual station shuts at 10 pm the area road is quiet the establishment of mcdonald's on the proposed site would create an unfavorable situation that currently does not exist the establishment of the business would create a gathering site which would result in new traffic flows and noise levels coming from cars wanting to turn into and exit the site increased noise levels would also come from cars starting up and from the car radios as customers listen to their music the introduction of a gathering area can also lead to anti-social behaviour which then can spill to off-site activities bayside council already has a known issue of carter hoons within the area and establishing an establishment of the business would only serve to encourage more of this type of behaviour in home and in particular my bedroom window throughout the night isn't something that we need order the residents living across from the site in addition to the signage light the lights from the site in general will provide an interference into our lives and there will be the headlights from the cars entering moving around within the site then exiting the additional lighting and noise will lead to sleep distribution from all residents which will have a direct impact on our long-term health even if there were reduced trading hours the establishment of a mcdonald's on this site would be inappropriate as it would create an unacceptable increase in traffic of the whole area another major concern associated with this application is that there is no traffic plan provided that will allow for this site to be used in a safe manner the latest application has suggested the removal of parking out the front of our houses where would it be safe to have my kids get in and out of my car am I expected to park a distance away and walk my shopping into my house of illegal u-turns at troopia and pembleton street or extra traffic on the side streets around the site mcdonald's claims to be a company working for the community and produces many feel good adverts advertisements to back this claim in this case mcdonald's is showing no respect or consideration for the immediate local community by proposing to establish an outlet within may in a mainly residential community a more general but very important consideration is what mcdonald's food stands for it has been identified many times that eating mcdonald's on a regular basis increases the customer risk to a number of health issues in closing the reality of having a mcdonald's on our doorstep could potentially have a very negative impact on all our children's lives this isn't what we need or should we have to deal with within our community having this application approved will have major repercussions on the neighbouring residential community and diminish our quality of life through increased traffic movements light spill noise associated anti-social behavior and pollution thank you very much for hearing me tonight I appreciate it the record yes alex thank you and we have someone else on the phone mr chair I'm just calling mrs tina to silly yeah thank you hello is that um mrs tina yes speaking sally this is the bayside logo planning panel and I believe you want to address this this evening yes yes thank you thank you for dialing in and would you please address the panel now for three minutes thank you very much thank you hi my name is tina and I'm a small business owner of a cafe I run with my three boys today is actually my six year anniversary of being in the cafe I run the cafe and has definitely have has had its ups and downs with covert being its biggest challenge business is tough but I'm pushing through keeping my boys in a job the day we heard mcdonald's was coming to our little town of botany felt like doomsday how can we ever compete with the drive-through system and their cheaper prices when mcdonald's has one dollar options it's hard for us little businesses all small businesses is going to suffer if mcdonald's goes through I will not be able to compete and won't be able to keep my lease going along botany road so many shops are empty I know I was looking to set up a business I would not be able to keep a lease knowing mcdonald's is nearby so botany will be left empty and not inviting another big mention is the litter situation I'm on banksia street not far from where the mcdonald's is actually going up but I'm forever picking up mcdonald's rubbish it seems to always get tossed into our front yard of the the cafe and with no one else to pick it up we are left cleaning it up um and botany mcdonald's hasn't even um hit botany yet I also um heard that when christina curry presented our petition uh which we had quite a lot of people sign in our cafe a member of rockdale council stated that her home also not far from mcdonald's was also covered with a lot of litter come in botany it will be um also a a problem with trying to keep the area clean with all the the rubbish that they have um and I'm not sure if there is a a solution to keep all of the areas of botany clean um not just only the surrounding area of mcdonald's but every other street around botany like I said I'm in banksia street and we have a lot of litter and the mcdonald's is in mascot um I also would really like to keep my kids it's a family business um and I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to keep the the business that I have tirelessly working seven days a week keeping my business opened to botany and I'm hoping I'm going to be able to keep my kids in this business but if a giant company comes in I really feel it's going to put not only my business down but all of the other small businesses in botany um hard to compete against them and be hard to keep the want to say it's been very hard to um think about what's going on but that's um pretty much what's coming from my heart thank you very much for your address okay thank you we have any other persons addressing us on this matter sorry do I have anyone else thank you good to hear from now we're after just other other parties that have registered to speak thank you thank you thank you mr chair that's all the uh registered speakers this fight okay so the the late submission we received from um ms bennett was simply that just the late submission and she's not addressing okay okay thank you uh any comments from the panel any thoughts from the panel um sorry yes yes um I just noted uh rachel had asked if we could confirm that we have viewed the videos that she sent through to us so um if that needs to be done then yes I have viewed those videos thank you I think I think the panels here gary just a question they've excellent presentations from all of them transcripted so that there is presentations because each of the points of view but they are uh in the sense of expanding on being prepared by council staff I i think I think that's a great idea and everything from traffic to amenity to impacts on local properties is all extremely useful and indeed mr mr morris's experience in the area what he relates to us I think uh is abundantly useful so good idea uh if you have those people if they haven't already covered those in their earlier submissions please don't hesitate to send them to our panel governance who's getting together our recommendation that we will decide on shortly I think I'm not telling too many details out of school if I say that the panel in its earlier deliberations has expressed a great deal of concern about this application and whilst I can't say what our recommendation or determination will be uh there doesn't seem to be too much in or too many comments in favor of it so I'll I'll cease in camera subsequently and I'll go to the next item which is 43 anniversary street botany can I thank all those submitters for their comments you're welcome to stay on otherwise you can 43 anniversary street botany I don't know there's a lot to discuss about this is their panel I have no no other than to support the recommend and indeed yep nothing further from me panel or me I i do support the recommendation of council uh the last item I i have in the public meeting is road and I wonder mr tyson we do have some questions for you thank you for staying around and I'm wondering if we might deal with those now before we go into closed session through you mr chair we have uh mr davis david javis architect um speaker tonight is that in respect of the last item yes that is you expect to the last item right okay um thank you mr jarvis yeah okay yeah I'm the um applicant in the architect for the project uh I just want to say I'm a an email to council um requesting an amendment to one of the conditions it's just a slight change in the wording when you follow the positioning of the pool to the letter of the words within the condition it creates some very awkward spaces around the pool in terms of the deck and the coping I don't know if you've got a copy of the email that I sent for it and now I've drawn some diagrams and suggested some work for a new condition that was was in the spirit of the condition but it just gave us a little more opportunity in terms of the quality of the space created around the pool just while we're looking for that perhaps you can articulate it please I i will um the condition requested the pool will be rotated at 90 degrees and be set back 2.2 meters from the northern boundary fence if we can rotate it a little in excess of 90 degrees so that aligns with the seven boundary fence we can create a little more space around the port of of coping on the northern side of 500 mil um when you look at that and you lay it out with the pool laid out 2.2 metres from the northern boundary that gives you a coating that's 1700 mil from the northern boundary um we can actually get the pool a little closer to the southern boundary and create some more space on the northern side of the pool so if the condition is written to say that the coping is to come no more than 1800 mil from the northern boundary which is actually a little in excess of what the conditions requested we can we can make the spaces around the pool work a little better panel that's drawing it's drawing uh dio3_._2408.16 yeah thank you for that did you did you wish to say something else no I'm available for questions but um no it was just regarding the condition because you might have taken a little pressure off if you type thank you for uh your presence okay no worries plus I know you've got uh a couple of uh questions from mr jarvis about the configuration for the pool uh I was just trying to find the latest drawing because I think we did get the latest drawing to understand the resolution the long boundaries and the extent to which it complies with setbacks from the boundaries particularly on the south and the west I'd be also interested to know if there's anywhere in that rear yard where you can actually plant a tree as opposed to the landscaping plant which shows plant material but landscaping but and whether or not it could be clarified how do you access the studio what is the studio going to be used for is there a reconfiguration of the staircase coming from the deck on the ground floor down into the garden I guess it's to my mind that I have not seen any diagrams which really optimize the potential use of the rear courtyard or rear backyard for this project so was that a question for myself or for the planner I think it's a question to you please okay I think so the use of the studio area so it's purposefully uh detached from the residents uh over the the the past couple of years it's become very apparent they're a home office that's a little detached from the front from the main dwelling it's quite a useful where's the door mr jarvis and it's the sliding doors on the uh at the bottom of the outside yeah that's right in the courtyard the the the level to which the stairs actually reach the courtyard remain the same so there's no change to the to the to to the stairs that come down from the desk um in terms of the positioning of the pool and how that works it's been dealt with by a condition of consent so there were no updated drawings provided the email that I sent through showed diagrams that interpreted the condition and suggested an alternative wording so that that space that's outside the studio how does that work so you have okay with me you have um a a paved courtyard area that has a barbecue in so that that that will be used as anybody uses sort of an external that's connected to an indoor space above that there's a there's a a balcony area that also provides some amenity for the um for the residents and the intent with the pool area is to use the pool in the summer and actually put a cover over the pool that allows that to be used as an external deck in the mugs where the pool is not visible so is your section bb and the staircase is the staircase from the ground floor down to the garden area is that the remaining where it's proposed it is yes with the reconfiguration of the pool yes yep gary I think you're just going to suggest can you just explain david's section bb then how the heights work if you're getting your moments I can just open yeah apologies it looks quite sunk and I'm trying to work out how you access that from the backyard yeah exactly so how you access the well I'm just I'm just when you look so I'm trying to work out their head do you go upstairs to get outside I don't understand how the section works with the backyard so so you have a direct connection to the garden from um the living room and the kitchen area see those steps taking directly down into into there there is no connection internally between the studio and the main dwelling yeah the path that goes around the side of the house and then you enter the studio from the from there from the courtyard area you can likewise exit the studio from the courtyard area into the covered terrace area and then up a set of steps into into the main garden area okay set of steps yep of the studio how is that achieved to be compliant we have openable windows we have openable windows um onto the terrace and also on the um on the east on this sorry underneath under under southern elevation they part of a previous approval or are they we they didn't seem to be sure the previous approval we had an undercrop space there but we've done is we've excavated a little deeper to create the the home office and we put the put the windows in the courtyard sorry I was wondering from the drawings how do we work out the windows are if you look at the um seven elevation it's drawing d850 you'll see the profile of the terrace and the steps and the windows so there's a highlight window in the southern elevation is the only window other than the opening onto the terrace other than the other than that the sliding doors that run the full width of the room yes yeah but that's and the actual terrace is also enclosed above and on on three sides well the the teres if we just go to the elevation above the the the deck doesn't go all the way to the um end of the teres on the southern side it butts the neighbor on the northern side so it's open on two sides and it has a boundary fence on one side I'm sorry I'm not understanding that I think look at drawing dao3 which shows the position of the deck that sits above the terrace yes you'll be able to see there's a timber screen on the southern side of the deck that that indicates the extent of the deck at that level you can see in grey below them a set of steps that takes you down to the terrace and then back up again so so this the the terrace that services the studio is open to the rear garden and it's also open to the south on the northern side there's a boundary fence there that encloses it I suppose mike and my question is the apertures or openings that are on that um it'll be the west end wall of the studio they are but they're they're also quite heavily shaded sorry are they are they windows or doors or walls let me just open the drawing that I believe there are sliding doors if I can open if if you open um draw in da51 that's taken from the rear garden you can see that the wall is three glazed panels which will be sliding doors that allows pretty much the entire two-thirds of the entire wall to be open to the terrace at ti-51s useful drawing that's good yeah ross do you have any other questions no just I'd I'd be interested to understand from mr jarvis the rationale for the significant increase in the fsr which is beyond what was approved obviously and beyond the controls that exist for this location we don't see the the the the additional space of having any impact on on anybody off the site or even being perceivable by anybody who's off the site but in terms of the the owners of the property it actually gives them a space where they can work at home they're a family with uh young children and to have a space where you can isolate yourself away from the rest of the family and work is being becoming increasingly valuable okay and just a clarification apparently in some of the drawings we have it shows a clouding around the front portion of the roof change to the roof can you can you tell me the specific drawing yeah the drawing is da52 it shows a clouding above bedroom three yeah if you bear with me I just need to I believe that those drawings were actually revised the change that that happened during the assessment process um was um it was originally approved with a condition here of consent to lower the ridge height when the um alterations and additions went in we neglected to actually reduce the ridge height on the drawing so we were asked to amend that and pull that back down and that may explain the plan so there's there's no change now no we're we're not and we never were intending to change the the any part of the of the drain other than the addition of the studio and some changes to the garden it was I think it was twenty four thirty mil difference in in level that we didn't pick up okay do you have any further questions with mr jarvis no not fine thank you I've got a's concern about uh floor space mr tyson I'm sure you've read the report yes and you've got a copy in front of you I do yes and on page 275 of the report it's got a an interesting collection of photographs photographs yes I'm referring to that um the first the top photo interestingly takes us from water to 220 where the bottom photo takes us from 218 to 224 when you were looking at the justification for your 4.6 did you look at the floor space of these these neighboring properties and if so can you say whether they'll complying or not complying with the development standard for the locality no the floor space ratios of those particular sites were not checked um so compliance can't_''_3211.52 be confirmed um from general observation um a number of those sites were a number of those alterations and additions you're referring to the first floor and whatnot we're of an older style so but once your question know um the floor space ratios and subsequent compliance were not checked okay any other thanks for staying back that's very helpful mr jarvis thank you for plugging in your explanation was a number of points it's quite useful uh we'll leave the public meeting now ladies and gentlemen and we'll bid you farewell and we'll now continue our deliberations on each of the matters that we've had before us thank you all for your input uh the determination will be placed on the council website probably in the next 48 hours thank you all
Hi everyone and thank you for joining us for today's lunch and learn program talking bayside tuesday today's topic is bayside council's inclusion planning and international day of people with disabilities please note this session will be reported and will be available in our have your say platform in a moment I'll hand over to today's presenter kylie mclennan who is our positive aging specialist at bayside council first I'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of bayside the gadigal physical people of the urination the people of the aurora nation and their spirits and ancestors will remain within our waterways and the land and mother earth I would also like to acknowledge that I am today working on the land of the darrow and gundam government peoples and I pay my respects to elders past present and emerging if you have any questions or comments throughout the session please type them into the chat along with your email and these will be forwarded on to the appropriate people and council to respond within seven working days I'll now hand over to you I'm just going to share my screen okay great I'll let you know when it started um I might do advanced actually so there we go great I might do presenter view just so I can see my notes there we go can you see yep that looks great slides great all right well thank you for joining us um as kelsey said I'm carly mclennan positive aging specialist at bayside council and I'm going to talk to you today about international day of people with disability and the bayside inclusion action plan um international day of people with disability is held on the 3rd of december each year it is aimed at increasing public awareness understanding and acceptance of people with disability the australian government has supported been supporting this day since 1966 I think it was I think my um sorry my mouse disappeared 1996 and provides funds to promote and raise awareness of the day and support activities around australia information about how you can get involved and help break down barriers for people with disability can be found on the website which uh video from their website hopefully this works all right kelsey can you see what I'm ah your screen isn't sharing just yet yeah there we go and there we go great I think it's important we celebrate international day of people with disability because for every person I've met that's living with a disability there's an incredible story the reason the international day of people with disabilities it reminds us to create equitable platforms for all aspects of life in our society it doesn't inspire people to want to get up and make america different I think it's important we celebrate all right so I'll go back to sharing my presentation now sorry can you are we back there kelsey that's great yeah okay so council has a long history of working to remove barriers to access and inclusion in the local community in 2014 the new south wales government introduced the disability inclusion act which required all councils in new south wales to develop disability inclusion plans in consultation with people with lived experience of disability bayside 2017 after extensive community engagement with people with disability their carers and families as well as community services peak bodies and other government agencies plan details commitments and actions under a few key focus areas which are prescribed by the new south wales government and they are building livable communities improving systems and processes supporting access to meaningful employment and promoting positive attitudes and behaviors so I will be sharing a few key achievements from this plan a bit later in my presentation I should also mention that due to the impact of covert 19 pandemic and public health orders uh new south wales councils were given an additional year to review and renew their inclusion plans um so we are now currently in the process of reviewing and um updating our plan in consultation with the bayside community um so this is the project timeline we have already undertaken a full 12 months of community engagement and I'll detail what we did for that a bit later in the presentation and we have almost finished drafting the new inclusion action plan which will reflect the feedback we received draft plan on public exhibition between the end of january and the end of march and this will be your next opportunity to have a say and shape the future plan um and then based on feedback from that round of consultation we'll update the plan again and then hopefully put it to council for adoption in june of next year okay um so let's talk about our first plan and what we achieved I've um kind of gripped all of the achievements under the four focus areas for you the first area of building livable communities council built and upgraded a range of community facilities and playgrounds to meet improved access standards and we also made our beaches more inclusive with the addition of a beach wheelchair at landscape beach I'll list a few other examples as well so we upgraded botany town hall with a lift and accessible toilet and ramp hillsdale community centre received new accessible toilet facilities astana reserve now has an accessible archery facility which is really exciting and um arncliffe youth centre also has a new accessible facility our library homes uh this is where staff take physical resources for residents to access library materials and reading aids for people with site impairment and hillsdale childcare centre was accredited as an inclusive service for children with additional needs and we were successful in acquiring funding from the inclusion support program for children with disability or undergoing diagnosis and as I mentioned earlier ram council partnered with the ramsgate lifesaving club to provide a beach wheelchair at ramsgate beach this wheelchair was donated to us by this george special school under systems and processes our council has proved the accessibility of its information communication methods and engagement processes we added the browsealoud widget to council's website which is an assistive technology that turns text into speech changes font sizes translate language and has a simplified tool all our online engagement projects identify people living with disability to understand any different outcomes and needs our engagement website which is have your say bayside uh ideas to the web content accessibility guidelines we also provide easy read surveys where appropriate and hard copies of surveys are made available upon request staff contact to speak to us in person or over the phone if they find that easier council uh also continued to actively resource and participate in local disability forums including co-convening the bayside george's river and southern shire disability interagency under accessing meaningful employment council continue to provide employment opportunities for people with disability and maintain accessible recruitment processes council staff are offered training and disability awareness and workplace adjustments are made available to staff with disability and staff are supported through the employment assistance program bayside garden centre has partnered with the disability foundation of st george to offer supported employment opportunities for people with intellectual disability um and under promoting positive attitudes and behaviours we undertook a range of events and projects and provided great opportunities to local services to achieve this outcome uh council initiated bayside women's week in 2020 hosting a cross-generational panel on leadership and featured a panel member living with disability from a refugee background council hosted live screenings of the access all areas film festival for international day of people with disability in 2018 and 19. council supported and hosted a peer-to-peer disability in the east and that was in celebration of international day disability last year council annually hosts sculptures by bayside and accessible tours are made for people with disabilities and older residents council provides an annual community grant as I mentioned before to community organizations in 2021 council supported wing gaps initiative for the international day of people with disability which was an accessible arts market um and there is a few more there oh look one more I'll mention one more the disability yes project from youth to community youth service in brighton engaged local young people with disability to conduct an access order of rockdale library um so as I said we've already undertaken at the first round of community consultation and which ran from september 2020 to september 2021 the process was heavily impacted by covert 19 and public health orders so face-to-face engagement was undertaken where it was possible and safe to do so however many activities were facilitated online and over the phone are in hard copy as well so despite the challenges presented by the pandemic there was still a high key stakeholders so some key activities that that we undertook was um we engaged young people to undertake an access audit of rockdale library we ran an online consultation this was facilitated by a consultant and um with the local disability interagency and uh 40 industry providers were represented at that consultation we ran for internal council workshops and an online survey on have your say and an easy read translation of the have your say survey was promoted to groups with intellectual disability we also ran three face-to-face workshops with key service providers and a meeting with bluefin who operate bexley aquatic center and three online interviews um with mood active vision australia and spinal cord injuries australia so um of all that of all the feedback we received um the main themes that came out were accessible toilets accessible information accessible parks facilities and local businesses council staff training promoting progress and achievements of the plan establishment of a local inclusion reference group accessible arts and culture and promoting inclusive attitudes and behaviors right so next steps council will be placing while aiming to place the draft inclusion register to be kept up to date on the project progress of the project and be notified when the plan goes on exhibition at haveyoursay.baseside.nsw.com um so I just say thanks for joining us and look out for the next opportunity to have your say on the bayside inclusion action plan uh and just one more before I hand over to kelsey sorry um if you have any questions and we can't get to them today you can always contact council's community life team on 936 3685 thank you
I think it's now um my uh pleasure to talk to you about bayside councils about the bexley school patriotic appeal flag as I said christina will be doing the majority of the presenting today um but just before I hand over to her I'd like to tell you a little bit about the provenance of the flag and I'll just share my screen with you now so you can see it so here is the flag provenance is a word that we use in museum and art galleries to refer to how something is created and the different owners that it might have had and the path it's followed to come into a particular collection provenance is important because it helps us to establish if something is authentic or if it is a copy now we know that in 1915 when the federal government was calling on men to join in what would become known as world war one or the great war bexley public school purchased an australian flag which they planned to drape over a memorial tablet that they had planned to engrave enlisting we don't know why the school purchased a red a flag with a red background which is the color of flags that are usually flown by merchant navy ships but we do know that red ensigns or flags were often used on land as well as at sea at this time so in 1915 there were many and various fundraising activities to raise funds for the war effort and one of those was a nationwide event which was called australia day and it was held on the 30th of july 1915. so for this event four councils in the greater st george area which at that time included the bexley municipal council in 1915 they combined their efforts and they had an aim of raising 5 000 pounds for the war effort so one of the events that they held was a picture evening which was to be held at the castle palace hall in rockdale which you can see on your screens now and at that event the bexley school principal a mr middenway offered attendees at the picture evening the opportunity to donate an additional sum people who made those donations their names would be embroidered onto the school's flag now we don't know how much each of these people donated but it did raise 42 pounds seven shillings and six pence and there are 59 names embroidered on the flag um so I'd just like to put that in a little bit of context um because it's hard to have an idea of how much 42 pounds is in today's money but we know that back in 1915 the average male weekly wage was about 2 pounds so if they raised 42 pounds they raised 21 times the average male weekly wage so just to give you some context if we were to look at that in 2021 when today the average male weekly wage is about 1 96 if we were to ask people to put in some money and have their names embroidered on an australian flag today we would have raised the equivalent of 42 000 today so imagine one fundraising effort having your name embroidered on a flag raising 42 000 so it's really quite bit that helped those four councils to raise over 7077 pounds for that australia day fund in 1915. now um we don't know who embroidered the flag but we do know that it was done by some very skilled people um and I've done a bit of embroidery and I like to do a bit of embroidery in my spare time and I can tell you that turning a corner is very difficult and it's very time consuming we know that the flag is made of wool and wool can stretch out of shape if you don't get the tension correct and even we know that the embroidery thread used was cotton and we know that the flag was most likely embroidered by women at that time in 1915. so um a local resident by the name of karen pentland has researched the people whose names are embroidered on the flag and she won the 2014 ron rathbone local history prize for her research unfortunately karen's not able to join us today um due to her work commitments but we hope that she'll be rockdale town hall with the flag and talk to you about the people whose names are on it um so earlier this year in 20 uh you know last year in 2020 when bayside council was working with linum hall to um repair the roof the flag was discovered in an upstairs room of this historic house we don't know how the flag came to be at lyden hall bexley school has no records of it being moved there but we do know that ron rathbone taught at bexley primary school for 24 years and was mayor of the former rockdale council for four terms and a member of the st george historical society so it's probable that he had some involvement in the transfer of the flag so when the flag was found it was dusty torn in places and in need of some tender loving care and so members of the st george historical society and you can see some of them there decided to ask bayside council to repair and preserve and exhibit the flag in a public place so here you can see jeff of this and george historical society with the flag um and bayside council in 2021 actually I know at the end of 2020 um engaged international conservation services to repair the flag and then we had specialists who framed it and have applied to have it um have helped us to install the flag in rockdile town hall it is available in a public space it is a good space for it because it doesn't get any natural light and flags are susceptible to fading or textiles are susceptible to fading in light so um we and as I said we hope to be able to have a special viewing with karen pentland on site to talk about the history of the people whose names are on the flag in the new year but now I'd like to hand over to christina ritchell who is the principal conservator of textiles um with international conservation services and christina will be able to talk to us about how she went about preserving the flag thank you christina thank you very much alison and thank you everybody for joining us today conservator for international conservation services which is based in chatswood and working for a private company it's unusual to actually get this insight into the history of a piece and because um as opposed to working in a museum where you eventually see um your work displayed in a in a exhibition and you learn a bit more of the history and as a private conservator often we we look at a piece and then it's picked up again after in treatment and then you sort of don't know what happens to it afterwards or often um don't get the same insight as I've just been introduced to so thank you very much for inviting me to take part of this it's been very um informative already and I do work on a quite variety of work from large tapestries large flag as this one but also small pieces that could be inherited or passed down generations in the family and at the very latest I've just been asked to look at a tea cozy that the clients would like to have today I'm very pleased to share with you some images and they talk about the conservation of the the bexley flag a patriotic flag let me just this is um a picture that's taken um pretty much a year ago when I was first um approached about the flag um it was brought in for me to look at and examine and and then uh put together a treatment proposal and a quote for what it was going to cost to stabilize it mount it on a archival backing and then eventually frame it and and that then pass back to a to the client and um and then it's it takes the time to either raise funds or approve a fund to uh to carry out the treatment and and then it came to be approved and we could start the treatment which only took place in august of this year so when you first look at a attack a piece of textile or any artwork for conservation it there's a lot of considerations that are taken into your your back of your mind for of all in order to be able to examine the piece it's a important to even just have space and as you can see the flag is quite big and then and at this particular plate the time our workshop was a quite busy one this is one of my colleagues yolanda in the background working on a curtain um and the piece itself was even too big for for our tables but eventually when when the backing that they was going to to be used for the framing was created that then was able to support the flag and and it could be viewed in full um but when you look at a piece for with in with the conservation in mind it's very important to look at the materials the way it's constructed what's its history what kind of damage do you see and what's also the intended use and where he we knew that it was going to be framed so that already um guides my my treatment option because I need know that it has to be mounted but actually when it was still not uh decided that in whether it was going to be framed or not so I had to come up with various options for both rolling of the flag which is a good um storage solution as it doesn't create any sharp creases in the flag and also it's as space saving um but for this say uh for this treatment and it was decided that it was mechanical surface cleaning was needed because of particulate soiling that had settled onto the surface over time there were some some creases that had occurred so realignment was necessary and then because of the framing um it was a big a large archival backing board was created which um is a core fluid backing board which is then covered with padding and then with an a backing fabric and we the one we use is um is one that's tested by the british museum and is approved for for close uh contact with textiles during a display for large period of time and then the flag itself is then mounted or stitched mounted onto that backing and losses before before they are then stabilized and I i apologize for the um the typo in this slide it's not wear areas but weak areas because they are over time um weak areas that develop in the in the fabric and especially um flags have been used over time and often it shows quite a lot of wear to um to the fibers and because of the way it had been folded there was some creases in there in the in the material and and we do a realignment by um using gore-tex_,_892.56 that most people know from winter jackets it helps keep you warm and sort of transport any moisture from your body out and away so you stay warm inside your jacket we use it in conservation to contr as a controlled method to apply a moisture to a a surface and before doing that it has is necessary to test any kind of the the flag or the textile you want to use just in case that any moisture causes the dyes to run or to bleed and and if that's the case to use this particular message or apply any moisture to the piece but um in this case there was a there's a dyes are all water fast and it was possible to use um this application to apply moisture to creased areas and then afterwards those areas that they dried between blotter papers and then with a bit of weight and what you see here the the squares on the white squares placed on top of the flag there are little weights that they that help the surface of the textiles just the the fibers dry and flat in in place again and be realigned um this slide shows uh three air the same tear and one of my colleagues has meticulously been sitting with her pair of tweezers and re-woven some of those strands of elements that have come loose over time and then and it is very tempting to get bogged down and um and lost in details like that but I actually had to to stop her and say it is it is a last treatment but we don't have all year for it um there are limits to how fine and meticulous we can be and I'll just show you the next one and so as much as possible you we do realign the the threads and the fibers that have unraveled and then we use a very fine um I'm not sure if you can even see it here but it's a polyester uh glutamine thread and it comes in in all kinds of colors and we use that in a stitch called a couching stitch where a long stitch is laid on top of the unraveling fibers and then you come in with a curved needle um and often we use very fine small needles you come in from the back and then just do small step stitch in in small areas that holds down the last piece of um of thread onto the unraveling fibers and and they are then held back and and stabilized in that in that way and um and as much as possible we use uh we put our stitching threads in so it aligns with the existing threads and then for the outline with the same fine thread and it's in the same curved needle and that is just to hold hold the um the flag in place along the the edges and then as you can see here you still see all the losses that have occurred in the flag over time and that's that's a a conversation to have with them with the client and what outcome you you wish because it is this is um typical of conservation that you stabilize and you preserve but you still um maintain the appearance of the flag as it looks now and it and all losses are seen as part of the history of the piece and what has happened to it over time whereas for example if you want to go more towards a restoration approach it is possible to place a red wool or similar material with the same kind of weave structure place that behind the flag and that would then disguise those losses and it doesn't draw the eye and but then you also sort of takes away some of the history but it's to what what is the um the intent of showing and then you see the the flag here fully framed and that is it's done um with a uv filtering glazing which does take away um the the damaging elements of light so that the fibers will be um it reduces the damaging portions of light so that the fibers will will be as long lasting as possible and also the dyes are not going to to fade but even then even with that um uv filtering a component we still recommend that that it doesn't receive direct sunlight or anything and also if you look in the lower right corner uh it you can see there's still quite a bit of puckering and there's actually a long line and that's an old repair um put in a zone to the flag and and it could we could have removed that repair and it would have been possible to lay the the flag all smoothed down but then again you you then remove some of the history of the piece and um and uh and treatment so you still have both puckering from um from the embroidery process but also from from repairs that have taken or being carried out through time but for us in the field of conservation that's all part of of what gives this um this artwork or flag a part of its history and gives it a character and I've put one last slide in just with the person there just to give you a sense of scale because this is it's it's really a big flag and it was a a big treatment to work on we were um two two full-time conservatives and one part-time working over three weeks and then in addition to that it was um it was brought to framing uh and that is sometimes a limiting or that they're more um a limiting factor because they can be backed up and in this case it was so that they took up quite a lot of space in the in the workshop and and I hope you get to go and visit and see it on display in the you thank you christina that was fascinating and I really enjoyed seeing the close-up photos of some of the detail in the flag you could actually see the warp and weft of the woolen threads that were woven and you could see that they've actually used a technique called raised embroidery so that the the embroidery threads um sit out in a sort of three-dimensional way from from the wool from the background um which is another very skilled technique to be able to do so it was really wonderful to be able to get those close-ups from you and I also appreciated um getting a better understanding from your perspective of the difference between restoration and stabilization and preservation of of an artifact and and it is um really good to understand that kind of or you know um repair that somebody must have done many years ago in that bottom right hand corner of the flag which is why it looks a little bit skew-if and why you can't you didn't want to flatten it out completely um so thank you for explaining that and the treatment process um for international conservation services and for the people of bayside who can now um come and view this flag and appreciate it and appreciate its history now I can't see any questions in the chat there um if anybody does have any questions that they'd like to ask of christina please feel free to to type something in and while you're thinking of those I'll let you know that we have one more week of lunch and learn sessions coming up and they are on mondays tuesdays and thursdays um actually I think there's some questions coming through now um and yes at the moment the chat is just between um participants and the hosts and then I I'll be able to read out those questions for christina that so that other people know what they're about um I don't think we have any other questions at this stage christina is there anything else that you'd like to add um well it might be interesting to talk a bit more about the difference between restoration and and and um and and and you know that they're not going to look that much different even after a lot of conservation is being put into that and that can sometimes be uh difficult to understand especially because it's a it's a long um costly uh effort and then you sort of expect to to for something to look all new again but um that's not always a uh the outcome with conservation whereas with a restoration and you might you attempt to to play to bring something back to what it looks look like originally or what was the for example the designer's intent yes yes that's a very important distinction we do have one question that's coming from jeanette and it's a very good one christina jeanette asks how long is it expected that the flag will be able to be displayed vertically before new conservation work will be required yeah so um so we attend we've attempted to um to support and stabilize the piece for as long as possible and um I didn't mention in addition stitched through the center where you can see there's a seam it's been stitched along the uh the perimeter of the the stars and also within the union jack so it is it is supported as as much as possible and um and I i would be I i don't want to put a date on or a time on years but but it is a long-term um display uh methods that we've used and also the one that are used for in museums where they call called the exhibition permanent displays and and of course nothing is permanent but it's a long-term uh solution and and I guess just to add to that part of the um best practice of displaying um any object in a museum is that you check on it at least on an annual basis um to see if it's still being adequately supported and you would do a surface clean at least for us on the outside of the frame and we'd be very careful about how we do that because as you said it is quite prepare the flag for display um and we want to make sure after it in the future and and here we've already um tried to reduce some of the factors like a uv um light bulb it's hanging in a in an area that doesn't get direct uh sunlight and filtering and that often that uv or the direct sunlight can be the the most damage oh a very damaging factor for textiles and then um if the fat the flag being wool is say it's a natural food source for for pests like carpet beetles or moss but because it's framed it is in a sealed environment so unless um it would be really unlikely that something happened to it now but it is a risk that's true that's true um we've got a couple of other questions coming through um one is is there uv filtering of the lights in the display area in addition to the filtered glass so as you said christina already said that the glass has a uv filter on it to protect the flag from question on notice because I'm not sure of if we've got uv um filters in place in that part of the town hall foyer I know that we don't have any natural light exposure there and it's sunlight that has um some of the strongest uv in it so let us take that question on notice there was another question there about how much it cost to conserve their frame I'll need to know to conserve the flag I'll need to take that on notice too but you can probably work out that as christina said it was two people working full full-time on it I think you said for three weeks and then one part-time person so even just thinking about wages for people for experts um you can get a bit of an idea from that and then a final question if that's okay is is framing the best way to display a priest of embroidery at home so christina are more of a question about um how we care for our our own um embroidered textiles and well framing is see it and enjoy it and it's not going to be handled or or abraded in any way but it is important then to consider the way it is mounted in the frame and also what kind of framing materials because um not all framers use archival backing boards for example and if you have a a masonite board or a cardboard or or some other on archival materials then that can have a an off-gassing or an acidic um effect on the on the textile itself and then that is is going to have an adverse effect or deteriorate the fibers over time so uh so yes and no is that right yes it is but be careful well I think almost all questions I've asked is almost my answer is it depends and it's to look at the piece and look at where it's going to go and then and uh yeah it just need a little bit more insight and exactly that's right yes um and I i know we said we won't take any more questions but I just wanted are we aware of any living relatives of the people mentioned in the flag or the people whose names are embroidered on the flag and as I said karen pentland has done the research into all 59 people on the flag her research is available to read online and we'll post that information in a follow-up email to people who registered for today's session but it is available through the bayside council website and I will make sure that karen answers that question when she gives a um personal uh a special tour or presentation about the flag in rockdale town hall in the new year so we'll be sure to to let you know when that's happening but right now I'd just like to say thank you to christina for making her time available today to give us a really insightful presentation into how this flag was so um carefully and expertly preserved I think I've used the right word conserved for um for the people of bayside and to thank you all for participating um we'll make this recording available via olive would just like to say goodbye to everybody too she's participated in many lunch and learn sessions with me and given me lots of moral support so thank you everybody have a lovely afternoon goodbye
 my name is thomas ferner and I work for bayside council in the parks and gardens department so we just maintain all the different parks and gardens in the area and do weekly maintenance runs and yeah so you get to do all different types of like project work like planting timber edging um earning money while whilst working uh learning on the job as well and it's fairly secure job as well so I enjoy working with all the boys in the depot very friendly we all get along together maintaining like I like doing all the street steps and all that sort of stuff and timber edging and project work and yeah it's a variety of work we do and yeah being outside love being outside so basically all the work so when you once you do your job you know what you've done so you can look back at what you've done and see like what you've seen like you can see the progress um and you get compliments from the community as well when I first came you meet along with all the boys they're all really trained in their role and know what they're talking about so yeah they made it really really enjoyable come to work and they provide me with a lot of advice on how to how to how to do the work and how to maintain and just get along with council work every day so I'll be receiving the apprentice of the year award so for three years so yeah it's great great achievement of mine I'm pretty good to pretty happy to achieve it like putting a lot of hard work with tafe and all that so it's good to get a good to get a certificate at the end of my three years um so some advice for apprentices you can get a qualification at the end of the course um it's great work conditions um everyone gets along here well at council and it's a great friendly environment to work in
Thank you so much um thank you everyone for coming today um I am indeed in texas I crossed over the ocean but I still love australia so I want to keep doing these talks and being in touch with you guys and learning more about bees and pollinators and the environment and nature as most of you know that I love so today I decided to talk about queens my phd was on stingless bees specifically on tetragonal carbonaria which I will refer as tc and my phd one of the things I tried doing was understanding more about the queens and their behavior why do I call it the queen drama we'll talk about it throughout the presentation and I hope that you guys will have questions and comments on the end um queens are a very important part for the social bees why because queens are the ones the mothers to most of the bees inside of a hive they lay all the eggs and they without the queens then the colonies just decrease in population and die that makes the queens one of the most mysterious why because they remain inside of the hype for most of their lives queens will fly out only once in a lifetime or maybe twice or three times or apart from that it's gonna stay in the inside of the hive most of their lives that makes them quite elusive and also very secretive and one of my phd aims was understanding more about the behavior that they have instead of have how they communicate with the workers and the males how are they selected and how are they made which is very important so that's why I call it the queen drama the mysterious lives of stingrays be queen so let's start I put this slide to begin with this is my introduction and I keep talking about this diversity of this there's around 20 000 b species out there 20 000 that's a lot I would dare you to name more than 20 species I don't think anyone can do that here not even me that is quite concerning because that means we don't know them even though they are that live deep in the ocean but these are insects that are visiting our gardens our plants are the bush that we walked around so 20 000 b species that's a lot and these are some species right I want to show this image for you to to know that they can come in different shapes colors and sizes they are all doing different things and but they do have certain things in common such as their diet right most of the bees are going to be vegetarian which means they will get stuff from the plants and they will get pollen and nectar by doing so they will move pollen around from flower to flower and they will do something called pollination which gives us fruits it gives fruits and seeds to the plants that's how plants can reproduce but it also as humans we can benefit from this important relationship because we get fruits from the trees so I'm sidetracking a little bit because I love to talk about this diversity however we're going to focus on a very small group of this piece of this 20 000 around species of this only around 620 are social so it's a tiny tiny percent out of all these b's a very very small percent are going to be social so this is more about diversity so in this case we're looking at size diversity of wheels so on the top left corner we have the smallest b in the world which is a bit called quasi hazmat then in the middle we have a b called apes milipera which is a honeybee and I put that one because we all know how that one looks we all know the size of that one so then we can get an idea of how the smallest b looks like and the biggest one in the world on the bottom part we have the biggest b in the world which is gigantic it measures around 40 millimeters and this be not many people know it it's called mega killer pluto that's a scientific name we thought it was extinct and we recently discovered it in indonesia back again so it's important to that that with our friends our family members and then conservation of peace can improve people can get more funding we can do more science and we can also protect them so I always like to talk about b diversity namely those again out of these three b's only the one in the middle is social which means either that both the top one and the bottom one are solitary b's what's a solitary they live lives just like flies do they one female will live by its own will meet a boy will reproduce and that female will take care of her own offspring what happens with social abuse social base have evolved to have this cooperation system in which they have different castes inside of the colony so we will have the queen we'll have the workers we'll have the guards and we'll have the males and they are all part of the same species and they are all cooperating for the well-being of the colony so that makes these two groups of peace very important to understand solid therapies and social we're only gonna focus today talk on the social beats because they have a queen and we're gonna be talking about these queens that is a close up for that smallest bee in the world so take a look at that one it's very very interesting it doesn't look like the honeybee it has adapted its body shape towards maybe the flowers that it's visiting but I like to put these two babies because they are very different to the honeybees and they are still these and they are still pretty cool and australia gets the pride to having the smallest bee in the world and indonesia gets the pride of having the biggest bee in the world great now focusing only in australian bees australia has around 1700 b species and only around 15 are social so out of all these images that you're looking at only two are social I would you guess which ones I'm gonna leave to you maybe like two seconds to try to guess but I'll give you the answer these are the names of the in australia and again I want to make emphasis in which ones are solitary and which ones are social so in the next slide all the solitary beasts will disappear and we will only keep the social bids that we find in australia this is it these are the only two groups of social bees we find in australia well western honeybee what do we know about that one that is not native that has been introduced in australia a long time ago and then the stingless bee which we have around 12 to 14 species in australia and one of them is the dragonila carbonaria tc which is the one that we find naturally in sydney and that's the one that I work with during my phd these two are social so again these two have a caste system which means they have the workers the queens the males etc and they also have different tasks inside of the colony so workers will be taking care of the queen sometimes but they will also be taking care of the eggs or foraging out for food we're not be focusing on the queens so let's talk about it stingless bees are found all around the tropics so this map is showing you where we find them australia is in blue because it has not many species it only has around 12 to 14 like we said before and it only has two genera in the map it's important to know that brazil has most of the species and that's why it's more red and orange because breast still holds around 400 species oxygen we're now focusing on this thing with this so I'm gonna also leave aside honeybees and while we'll be talking only about the stingless big queens so again what makes them highly social like a cooperative brute care which means workers are not able to reproduce anymore but they can take care of the eggs and the queen we have that presence of castes which is inflexible which means if a b is born a queen it's going to stay a queen if a bee is born a worker it's going to stay a worker and to stay a male why does it stay inflexible because some other bees can be flexible for example bumble bees in bumble bees queens can begin their lives as workers which means the queens will be foraging for food and taking care of the eggs and then later on once the first clutch of eggs uh develops and become adult workers then they will start doing the work of the workers and the queen can finally stay in the job of the queen so it means that the queen will no longer forage actively for food or take care of the eggs the workers will be doing that the only task of the queen is going to be laying eggs so in the case of stingless bees the queens are not good at doing foraging tasks they only do what the queens do which is laying the eggs they don't have a solitary face in life so again comparing to bumble in the queens of bumblebees they are more hardcore because queens can be by themselves at the beginning be alone and start laying eggs by themselves in the they're always surrounded by workers helping them queens are quite useless if you separate them from the colony they need to be fed by the workers and be taken care by the workers I'm perennial colonies which means colonies can live for more than a year again compared to bumblebees bumblebees are found in places that have really cold winters such as canada and russia which means their colonies will die every year before they die they will send out the queens so the queens can go out get a lot of food and then go underground so they can iron age and then in the next springtime the queens can come out and start a new colony honeybees and stingless bees are perennial which means they never have they never die these colonies can go over and over again so we can have colonism kind of live around 50 years 100 years they eventually die if the queen dies and they are not successful at reclaiming but it's a very different life from that of bumblebees okay now reclaiming process so now if we understood what we see a hive of a social b in this case a stingless b most of the time it's going to be in a state that we call it the queen right state so most colonies out there have a queen and we call that state the queen right state or queen right colony what's very interesting is what happens when the queen dies so if the queen dies then the colony goes into a process called the requiem process in which they need to build up a queen again but they also need to select the queen they like the most that's very interesting and that happens sometimes in the colonies why would the queen die maybe she got an infection maybe a virus took her down or maybe she just died from age it doesn't matter because if she dies then the whole colony goes into this very interesting process of requieming so in order to reclaim they need to make wins and we'll talk about this in the next slides how are they made which is very interesting let's forget about on the right side that is going to be called the princess b or the virgin queen so virgin queens need to come in handy at this time if the queen dies virgin queens will appear in the colony they will be selected through a very interesting process inside of the hive and again I will not go into detail because I will explain that later but once the princess is selected then the males will gather around the hive she will mate with only one male and then she will go back inside of the colon and she will become very big as the queen we see on the left side great this is a picture showing you how the males are gathering outside of the colony we call them the male roosters or also male swarms and what they are doing is they are coming from around the area gathering in a big cloud of males waiting for this queen to come up they fly during the day and in the evening or the night they will roost so they will form these bachelor groups all together roosting are always allowed to come back into the hive so they get a cozy night environment in the stingless b world it's a little bit more hardcore males need to stay outside and they are never allowed back in into the high so it's good luck you're a big boy you stay out so they will congregate and they will join in these big clusters of only males so for the people that already own stingless b colonies sometimes we see this throughout the years especially in springtime and it's very interesting to observe that is during the night what they do they rooster but this is during the day so I want to show you this video these are males flying so this is what they do this is called the male swarm all these thousands of males are flying in front of the colony and that colony that it's in front of them it's a colony that doesn't have a queen and need to equate so they are being called from the apartment which is very very interesting the video was these nail straps can be and one of the questions that I get sometimes is how are these males arriving who is calling them how can they sense the colonies so the answer to this question is not easy it's still being studied in brazil and some other countries and we think it's a role playing from different parts it's just a intertwine of roles from different beasts inside of the house so we think workers are putting a signal out there in the environment saying we are queenless we need males to mate with our princes so they are leaving little cues in the environment by leaving little cent trails and then once males find these centrals they start arriving close to the hive and then they can smell the princess which is going to be smelly but not from a very long distance and then males once they start congregating they will also attract themselves so males can also smell other meals so we think it's a whole role playing between princesses males and workers good next uh thing I want to address is interesting too because in the stingless bee world and honeybee world every single female can become a queen at some point so workers are females queens are females what is telling them apart so in the case of honeybees there is something called royal jelly so if you feed a baby girl bee with royal jelly then you can make a queen if you don't give her royal jelly then she will become a worker once she becomes a worker she never can go back into being a queen so this is for the stingless bees they do not have royal jelly and what is gonna determine if she becomes a queen or not it's the amount of food that she gets when she's a baby so we call them the queen cells and these images a and b is showing you how big this cell is compared to the rest of the other cells so I do some work at primary schools and kids have called it the big potatoes so that's how I call them now so in image b specifically you can see the cells that are next to it so on the left side we have all the worker cells and on the right side we have the queen cell which is almost double triple the size of a worker cell once the princess hatches then she's gonna be looking like the one on on letter c and once that princess actually mates and meets the boy then she's gonna become really big like the one we see on letter d queens and distinguished b world so this image is showing you how they can vary so every single letter is showing you a different species they are all from brazil but like we said at the beginning of the talk we also find stingless bees in brazil which are closely related to the ones in australia and just take a look at how they look they are pretty big once they mate they will never be able to fly back again contrary to honeybees in honeybees queens can always fly back again by not eating for a few days so they decrease their weight and then they can keep so once the queen has made it she will never ever fly back again the queens enlarge a lot and they are quite stretched and that's why they look so creamy because they are full of eggs inside so just an example a tc queen can lay around 300 eggs every day which is a lot of eggs in a lifetime this is a picture I took while traveling in brazil so this is very cool this is one of the only one uh species in the world that can have more than one queen so in this case we have three queens so we can tell them apart from the workers because they are quite big again they are quite enlarged if you I'll go back and you'll see so workers are on the left side queens are on the right side so you can see how big and chunky they look compared to the rest of the ones the species can have up to seven queens in this case we saw these three queens which was very exciting they all seem to get along nicely the other queens and they're all laying eggs and helping the colony survive which is really cool another thing I want to touch on it's a fact that we can get some miniature queens so what are miniature queens this is a very interesting concept in uh the top image we see the miniature queen and the bottom one it's a normal queen so most bees will do what they are told so if they are they're a worker bee and they are laid the egg is laid in a worker cell then the little larvae will eat that food and will become a worker we do however have some selfish larvae which will sneak in the neighbor's cell and start stealing the food so in the case of a miniature queen that queen was not supposed to be a queen she was supposed to be a worker but she didn't want to be a worker which is very interesting so this larva ate all her food and then when she was done she didn't want to stay like that so she just's food so what happens she doesn't get enough food to become a full queen but she also doesn't get enough food to become a worker so she gets to be something in between so these little selfish queens have also been studied um we don't know how this happens in the australian stingless beast but it certainly happens in brazil and they can rule colonies they can be normal queens they can also be selected by the workers so it's something very interesting to do follow-up studies but as I said before this we don't know if this happens in australia uh this is the anatomy of the queens so in this image it's from a study that I published a few years ago in this image we see the different ovaries of uh females in this bee colony so we have remember that workers are also female so they also have ovaries but they are very very small compared to the queen ovaries so that worker ovary it's on the bottom left side then we have the virgin queen ovary which have the major queen over which is huge why is it so big because this bee has made it already and all the eggs have starting to develop inside and that's why we get these big big uh balls in white what I also want to touch on this image is that little bubble structure that we see in the virgin queen and the maiden queen at the bottom of the virgin queen ovary we see this bubble thing that looks empty and in the maiden queen it's full of white stuff this thing is called the spermatheca and this is a very special organ that the queen uses to store the sperm of the male for her lifetime so she can fertilize the eggs whenever she wants so this organ allows the sperm to stay alive for the rest of the lifetime of the queen which is really impressive which can be around two years so in the virgin queen it's empty because she doesn't have a sperm yet and in the maid queen she has made it obviously she's gonna have the sperm all her 300 eggs that she can lay every day so it's a very very fuller world in this one we can see again those uh little structures with the little asterisk that is the spermatheca so in letters a and c it's empty and in the letters b and d it's already full of sperm so that's when they always start becoming active letters c and d are virgin queen ovaries and that's why they are like quite uh they have this spiral shape and letter b it's a queen ovaries and that's why they look way bigger and then letter a it's a worker ovary so that's why it looks so small um good so now that we understood anatomy and a little bit of the behavior I want to go and touch on the part of queen behavior so how are these queens actually selected um if the queen dies and they only have one princess that is an easy path that one single princess is going to become the new queen but what happens if they have process which is like a democracy you could say like little uh political parties around so each queen is giving certain information that it's different from the other queens and the workers are the ultimate selectors inside of the house so workers will actually end up selecting which queen they like the most so in this video we can see how this virgin queen which is in the middle it's trying to communicate um information to the workers and in a few seconds from now we're gonna see aggression which is how the workers actually jump on top of the virgin queen and start uh attacking her so in this case we can see how the worker is not very happy with her they are actually trying to attack the queen and the way they take them down it's a little bit dramatic um they will chop off the antennae and the wings and some parts of the body and then they will just put some resin around them so they completely immobilize them and then the next day they will just uh take them out a very dramatic world out there in this video uh in this image we see that a virgin queen in the middle also and what was very interesting about this image is that a few seconds later I saw other two uh princess peace just walking around so in this case we had three princesses that were all like communicating information and ultimately only one got to be the lucky one which was the only one that got selected finally to wrap up I just want to talk a little bit about the behavior about how they start their lives and what development pathways they have so in this case this is the line of queen life we can call it the first step it's a clotion so it's when the queen comes out she's gonna be bigger than the workers and she looks creamy in color then she's gonna go into step number two which is the hiding phase so in hiding phase queens will be very shy they will not be out they will be hiding from the workers because as we said before queen right state they will not be useful for the colony so then they will be killed so they need to be hiding for most of their lives however if the queen does die then the princesses go into this very interesting stage we have it here so that queen moving around we can see her quite frantic frantically it's uh just acting it's very active it's very full-on with her activity and she's just flapping wings around trying to communicate information with the rest of the workers which is a very big change with step number two in the other way that it was hiding most of the time and suddenly out of blue she just becomes extremely active and trying to interact with most of the workers then in step number four the queen is gonna leave the colony so this is the only time she's gonna fly away from the colony so it's only maybe one or three times she does location flights at the beginning and maybe one or two location flights and then the third one will be the and we already know that there will be a male swarm outside of this hardship we made with only one boy which I didn't said until now so in this case the queen's only made with one single male and then she comes back into the hive right so this is the mating this is a video showing how uh the male is mating with the queen and we can see how the male is just leaving a little part of his body in the queen which is known as the mating plug and then the queen is going to be fertilized by the male the next steps are very interesting so once the queen comes back into the hive she's going to be surrounded by the workers and she's going to be inspected so in this case it's quite a crucial step in the way that workers will decide whether they like her or not once she is uh accepted then we're gonna go into this image where we see the queen painted in green being surrounded by all these workers which is has been accepted by the workers then she's gonna start laying eggs so in this last video we can see how they have already started to lay eggs we can see all these themselves and we can see that very queen painted in silver just walking around the eggs and laying eggs quite happily other behaviors that I observed were positive and negative so in the first one I saw feeding from the workers so if the workers are feeding the queens that means they obviously like her and that is a good sign however some negative behavior that we can have from workers is aggression in which workers will jump onto the queen and start biting her off execution as we said before it's when the workers will actually pull limbs away and will put wrestling on top of the queen so they will mummify her and the last one is uh rubbish loitering so we can see how some queens just go into the rubbish area and they just wait there patiently to be attacked by other workers that is uh two queens that I painted found loitering around that rubbish area I had a third queen painted in green which was being fed by the workers so it's quite clear that workers have a preference right away for one of the queens and then the rest of the queens will be just waiting patients before being attacked by the workers great that is all for now it's really good because it took half an hour um I do want to say again how important these are I couldn't touch much on conservation but insects are facing a lot of problems at the moment I think it's our duty as uh humans to protect them and to start talking more about them and do more education sessions so we can understand more about the diversity and how important they are and thank you all for coming today to the talk I hope you enjoy the talk and I'm happy to stay as long as needed for questions and comments so thank you very much
Just waiting it's okay now facebook's done so are we ready and this will be recorded the recording has started are we right I'll declare the public I'll declare the public meeting open at six so two and uh indicate the purpose of the bayside planning panel the bayside planning panel is charged with considering planning and planning proposals of any scale or value and determining development applications where the value is less than 30 million dollars and where there is potential conflict of interest or a contentious development or there is substantial departure from development standards or it is a sensitive development council no longer considers these types of developments in particular the panel must consider development applications which have attracted 10 or more unique objections at a public meeting others can be big cloud side of the public meriting all decisions within 48 hours live stream amendments to existing laws to help combat the spread of curve at 19. as such the public are not able to physically attend the panel's public meetings instead applicants and those who have registered to this public meeting is being recorded and is live streamed to council's youtube page the recording is an official record of council and may be made available to persons upon request in accordance with freedom of information legislation meaning government information public access act 2009 applicants and members of the public that have registered to speak on an item will be asked to unmute their phone or computer at the relevant time to address the panel and to answer any questions I made written submission which has been provided to the panel members once the panel has heard from all speakers including the applicants we will either make a decision during the public meeting or adjourn to consider our decision as previously mentioned all decisions of the panel will be published on the website and normally within 48 hours my name is ross bonthon and I'm chairing the meeting today my background is that I am presently still practicing as an architect urban designer working on major projects in this country and elsewhere overseas formerly I was the principal architect for the lend lease group for some sydney council as well as the pit water council and various other government and semi-government agencies meetings panels and advisory bodies and I'm currently chairman for this panel and have been previously serving on other panels I'll have I'd ask the other panel members to introduce themselves before we commence so martial could you please introduce yourself thanks chair my name is marcia and my expertise is in law I have worked for many years as a lawyer and much of that time has been spent practicing environment and planning law I'm involved in I've also worked as a senior executive in state and local government and so I also have expertise in public administration and governance I am also involved in other local planning panels and regional planning panels in new south wales government committees and I'm on the board of city west housing which is a community housing provider in piedmont thanks ross thank you master amber if you could introduce yourself please thank you ross amber o'connell here I'm the community representative I have expertise in unrelated fields but the da process having both put in da's of my own to renovate my own home and have been subject to neighbours da's so understand the process and all the difficulties that can go along with it um and have various expertise in policy and both writing and receiving submissions thank you and welcome amber for coming tonight robert if you could introduce yourself please uh thank you mr chair um uh my background is in uh as an elected representative for nearly 20 years serving variously and concurrently as a councillor mayor and a member of parliament in the new south wales parliament in 2015 I established a consulting business focusing on planning and affordable housing and I also serve as a member of the board of the riverwood community centre and the city of canada bay planning panel in addition to the bay side council robert thank you very much now before proceeding with the meeting can I acknowledge the country for the bayside council respects the traditional custodians of the land the eldest past present and emerging on which this meeting takes place and acknowledges item is apologies I don't believe we have any apologies we're all present are there any disclosures of interest from individual panel members nothing from me thank you nothing from me so thank you so we all we all submitted signed forms to indicate that we had no uh no interest or conflicts now item number four minutes of previous meetings there was a meeting held on the 19th of october and the minutes have been confirmed by the chairperson of that meeting and so they can be noted and that the panel also notes the minutes of the meeting on the 2nd of november 2021 which have been confirmed as a true record of the proceedings by the chairperson of that meeting item number five reports from planning proposals there are no planning proposals for us to consider tonight six there is one I'm planning to be considered tonight which is item 6.1 that is a da for for vanstone parade sandringham uh I believe we have mr as aston that wish to address or is attending the meeting tonight is he available or is he meeting at this stage so he has not joined the meeting he has not joined the meeting so we'll proceed the recommendation for this application is refusal is there any discussion from the panel and on that basis if there is any dialogue that anyone or any comments that the panel members wish to make I just comment that I agree with the officer's recommendation that the um that the rooftop terrace is too large and over overbearing and has an unacceptable impact on the um on the streetscape any other comments robert I agree uh I agree with martia mr chair I i when I initially was reading the report uh I was wondering how we might you know conceivably uh approve the application and then I saw the design and realized that it couldn't be approved thank you I just uh echo those comments and note the impact on neighbours and um the principle that it would set um which would be unacceptable thank you thank you panel I mean I think also just reading the report was an interesting exercise but then to see is at figure 34 which is on page 102 of the report it very clearly says that this is something that does not comply with the desirable outcomes for this neighborhood and so I'm happy I as I guess I hear from the rest of the panel members to support the staff recommendation for refusal those in favor aye so that would appear to be unanimous that it is refused and the applicant should be notified accordingly and on that note I'll close the meeting at 6 12. thank you very much for your attention and attendance just bear with us until facebook is closed

planning panel so this panel is charged with considering planning proposals of any scale and value and determining development applications where the value is less than 30 million dollars where there is a potential conflict of interest where there is contentious development or a substantial departure from development standards or where it is sensitive development in particular the panel must consider development applications which have attracted 10 or more unique objections in a public meeting and this is a public meeting other development applications can be considered outside of public meetings the meeting is being live streamed on council's facebook page and the recording of the meeting is an official record of council and may be freedom of information under the government

bayside local planning panel meeting held on the 5th of october have been confirmed as a true record of proceedings by the chairperson of that meeting we don't have any planning proposals and so now that brings us to the two development application the two items on tonight's agenda the first item is for a development application for 24 napoleon street san souzi we have a written submission which has been received and read by the panel and that was received from mrs kim and mr neil martin who are affected neighbours and that submission uh was against the officer's recommendation the officer's recommendation is that the development application of the development application we have two speakers registered to speak in support of the officer's recommendation and they are rhonda jammu and um steliani lascaris whoever would like to go first we have andrew lamparelli are you are you um here to speak uh in relation to the 24 napoleon street sam susie matter andrew no madam chair we have um stelina on the on teams and she is one of the applicants for 6.1 they're not the video thanks faustos to siliani if you'd like to um go ahead and address the panel uh yeah can you hear me we can thanks okay um so I am the proposed owner operator of the cafe that's intended to go into that space so I'm just here to answer any questions that you have in regards to uh the operations of the cafe uh and ronda jam louie is available to answer anything in regards to the planning thanks siliani we did have some questions about one of the as you probably know in order for this development application to be approved it relies on shop was in existence before the local environmental plan that prohibited that use in this area and what we don't have before us is evidence that that use as a shop has been um happening uh since um I think it's 1982 um when the the controls changed can you say anything about the use of the shop how long have you been in the business uh okay so I am um I'm not actually I don't own the business 24 napoleon street that that's currently there which is like a mixed business I own the cafe uh 36 tuffy avenue saint susie which is proposed to go into that site should it be approved uh in regards to the uh sorry did you say that you owned the the shop that's that's on the right I i own the business that's proposed to go into that shop should they be approved in regards to the uh existing youth rights ronda gem louis who I think should be on here um is uh is equipped to answer those questions she actually prepared are you there rhonda would you like to if you're there if you'd like to just introduce yourself and tell us what you can tell us about how that site has been used over the last decades you there rhonda rhonda hasn't um teams didn't yet madam chair right thank you um well we'll leave that for the moment do any panel members have any questions for uh ms laskaris about the proposed cafe uh yes I i have a question uh if I may it's robert montgomery yeah um you're operating a cafe dubai is that right correct yeah it's it's the opposite side of the road 36 tuffy avenue right okay and and is that cafe going to remain in operation while as well as this one or is it going to be a different uh is the existing cafe going to close at this stage we haven't determined as to what we will do that that cafe is quite a very small operation we've been there for the last 10 years um if if it does current operation uh if not it will more than likely change to a different sort of business I assume but that'll be up to the landlord of course I don't know in the building no no I was asking whether your existing cafe would close no no okay um the other question I had is that uh as during the course of this application initially you wanted to trade from 6am to 9pm and during the course of discussions with the council you've agreed to change that to 7am to 5pm that's a fairly significant reduction in hours how's that going to impact on you do you think it's still viable and achievable with those very limited hours uh with those limited hours is is pretty much doing what I've currently been doing in the space 36 tuffy avenue for the last 10 years so the our intention was to operate between those hours uh the extension of the hours were merely as a buffer should we have taken on private parties or as a one-off sort of event um but the hour operate as and that's so that's not uh no effect at all okay thank you for that you're welcome can I just clarify uh miss lascaris that the proposal is that the cafe um take up so there's a private dwelling somebody lives there so that will continue and then there's a um a storeroom and then there's also a it's a part of the shop is it proposed that any element of the shop continue or that the storeroom use continue okay so it's a little bit confusing this is our second submission um on the same space so that storeroom was from the first submission so it's actually not a storm it's going to stay exactly what it is trading as at the moment which is just a vacant space so we're only occupying occupying uh the proposed cafe area which I'm pretty sure is highlighted in in yellow so that's the corner and then behind that in red yeah is the is is currently a dwelling residential dwelling the the blue parts the up here it's blue the storm is green and then in red what what page is this on can I just confirm um it's on page 10 of the council report or if you're just looking at this group yeah I'm looking at this one three of 34. just can't_''_881.519 read the writing in the red and work out what they read yeah sorry just give me a minute uh well I've just been advised by ronda that she's still awaiting a link to in order to join fausto will um we'll assist with that sure sorry it won't be a moment okay okay um okay uh so the area in blue is a residential space yeah so that's page 10 of this uh of this yeah uh yellow is where we're proposed to be situated uh and the red is a part of the existing building which is currently uh they're currently trading as a as what they were doing currently which is the convenience store so that will not change it's what it's been so there'll still be a convenience store on the side plus the cafe is that right yeah yeah which is which is currently what they're operating as and what they have been operating us for the last number of years yeah so I'm just I'm proposing to occupy only a part of that space yeah so the shop will get smaller and then correct in the plate area that used to be shop there'll be the cafe correct yeah and you hours that you're asking for is you start at 7am yep um in the cafe that you currently are operating up over the road what sort of what's happening in that cafe it's between sort of seven and nine in the mornings uh seven and nine in the morning is not the busiest period um it's just morning sort of traffic where it's mainly take away and uh a few sort of dining as well so the the capacity of what we're trading at the moment state-wise um is very similar to what we're proposing here okay yeah madam chair yes ronda is on the I've called it through the mobile so she's online thanks fausto uh rhonda it's marcia darwini speaking I was just wondering whether you can tell the panel what what you know about how that that building has been used um and what's what's your knowledge of the history of use of that building uh okay uh see so the site has been zoned fp2 since I'm just interested in your knowledge of of how that site has been used as a so the planning assessment report tells us that it's used as a shop for many years and do you have direct knowledge of the use of the use as a shop and if so how long is your direct knowledge of that use my direct knowledge is only based on the archive history I've got from council's um archives department um but from as far as I know it's just been a convenience store right okay how long have you been and that's been since the 1980s and and you run the convenience stores no sorry sorry I'm not the owner of the shop I'm the town planner for the application oh sorry okay right okay and did you prepare a submission to council which as a town planner you'll know that it's the applicant's responsibility to establish continuous lawful use um of of of the site did you provide any submission or other information that um establishes continuous lawful use since the uses that since the shock use was prohibited so that was provided within the statement of environmental effects that was originally lodged with the d.a um and there was a assessment of division 4.11 of the environmental planning and assessment act that was part of the statement environmental effects and and and that so that set out an analysis or a submission that's based on the council records of the actual the actual use correct that's right and and councils come to the same conclusion as as myself we've both done I guess the same archive history and we both obtained the same archive history and come to the that is currently approved for since 1952. and so that so that goes to the question of consent so you so in the assessment report there are a number of development consents and other approvals but what I'm asking about is actual continuous lawful use well yeah so the in other words that it hasn't been abandoned or changed it's definitely it's definitely currently in use at the moment as still a convenience store yeah I understand that but but what the panel needs to be satisfied of yeah has been used for the use so the reta for the shop use that's been used for that shop use continuously um with with no gaps uh since the lep that prohibited that use I'm not exactly sure but I think that might be 1982 or some other similar date yeah it was in 1983 and um so there was an application um dated the 23rd of the 5th 1985 and that was for the extension of the existing commercial shop and there was a previous one in 1983 it was lodged for the extension the oldest application we can find was for 1975 for the additional space for groceries for the shop um and that's as far back as it goes and from my understanding it's been in use as a retail premises since the original application in 1952 and have you got any uh evidence that of that uh we just have used the evidence that we have is um just con lodged and approved applications of continuous use or ancillary uses to the to the existing use or ancillary storage to the existing use of the premises and that that started from 1952 and the last one we had was in 1985 and then what about since 1985 is there any information or evidence about the use of the premises since 1985. not I'm not asking about consents I'm asking about news from the information provided it becomes evidence proposal remains within the most recent consent and has operated as a retail premises since um I'll just read he so you're reading from the statement of environmental effects correct yes so in terms of continued use we are assuming that the premises is being used as part of the consent that was issued in on the 23rd of may 1985 and and you're aware as a planner that it's the applicant's responsibility to establish that lawful continuing use and that and that as the as the as the consent authority the panel has to be satisfied that of that law correct um correct but if there are no if there have been no further applications since 1985 um how would the panel like to be demonstrated that the application of the store has been used and what sometimes happens is that um statements are provided from the people who've been running the shop for example okay yeah that's that sort of information um I guess we could provide a condition uh by to the cc that that a letter um be provided by the current owners do actually how long the current owners have been there they've been there a while um but stella's been there for 10 or so years and they've definitely been there since then owners have been there operating for approximately the last 20 years I've been there for 10 so I can vouch for the last 10 years and they would have been there for approximately the last 20 years their english is not very good the owners um but you're more than welcome to they'll provide me with any information required in order to satisfy your request okay well thank you they have like maybe a lease agreement seller would well they are they're they they're owners and operators of the business so they are actually the people that have been operating it as a convenience store for the last 20 years yeah yeah if I might add uh madam chair it's robert montgomery just so the applicant or the planner doesn't go away thinking that all I need to do is get a statement from the owner that they've been there since whenever the sorts of proof that is usually supplied yes can include a statement um from an owner and it's often on um a statutory declaration or something of that you suggested a lease agreement which there won't be in this case but also things like receipts for deliveries of produce and stock things like inspections and licenses from relevant government authorities that you need to be licensed from those sorts of things that demonstrate that it's been continuously used okay understood it's not just one of those things it's it's a combination of those things which which when you lay it out in front of the council or the panel in this case it tells the whole story that yes it's been continuously used and you know on on balance that uh that it appears that it has been um I do have a question you can perhaps clarify something for me I noticed that the commercial premises is divided into two separate tenancies one of which is currently vacant can you shed some light on when the approval was issued for it to be divided into two separate shops uh I believe that I believe that was in 1985 uh sorry I'll just double check the consent here uh so in was lodged for an extension of the existing commercial area shop and all we have from the assessment report was the property has a dual zoning and half the property front fronting napoleon street including a split on the corner of swanston blue street so there's no is there an approved plan there's nothing there that suggests that it was turning one drop into two has an attached office in residence at the rear the residence is currently being let to ten of the single garages at the boundary noah no there is no other there was no plan all I had was an assessment report but it doesn't mention two tenancies okay the other thing something about a fire a fire-rated wall between the two shops in the approval in 1985 so so there was a condition about a fire-rated wall yeah okay um the other question about that is I understand that the smaller of the two tenancies is currently vacant um can you tell tell us how long that's been vacant for and how have you dealt with that in your submission for vacant is not proposed within the ca and I understand that yeah yeah and we'll be ending use the storage by the animals so the council report council report tells us that it's vacant it's currently vacant it is vacant yes so and that's what and you don't you don't know how long it's been vacant for as a commercial premises as a commercial premises no seller do you know how long it's been vacant for okay it's it's technically not vacant I mean the the owners are currently occupying both spaces so they use it uh in in order to to store um whatever stock they've got so it is a part of their that the only reason why it's obviously been separated now is because we're only occupying that portion of the space that's in yellow but technically they occupy it but it's just not used as an activated shop front is that correct yeah it's not an activated shop front but they do occupy it as a part of their operation um judy and I wanted to ask about the waste perhaps it's a question for you stella can you just run me through how in in your mind the waste will work because there's a waste bin enclosure proposed outside the tendency that you that you're not proposing to occupy so so just tell me how there's no is there a waste holding room inside that you're going to use our proposal is to enclose the space obviously not completely with the roof but it will be it will be protected with a gate um the reason why we located that there it does have direct access um with the driveway uh so therefore the the waste can be rolled in and rolled out easily and likewise with the grease disposal I can tell you based on our current operation we're very mindful of the of the residents in the area so we do pick up the additional cost of uh of pickups two or three times a week so that uh waste is not um it is not uh excessive uh so we that's pretty much where it will be located just in that corner there did you say you're going to wheel it out in a dr through a driveway uh it's literally that space there is is a part of a it's got a ramp where it can be wheeled out to the road because that's where the commercial waste needs to be picked up from it needs to be accessible through a driveway any any commercial waste yeah okay so you'll take the waste and out of the shop and deposit it in the bins pending collection by a contractor right and so that waste will sit on the footpath or on the land it's actually part of the site permanently it won't be um that'll be an enclosure that's always where you deposit your waste okay thank you thanks for the clara peter did you have any questions or comments oh yeah look if I could just ask in relation to the area where the outdoor seating is proposed I'm not too sure probably for ronda but whether that's being that area being used as part of the um commercial business at all the the outdoor seating area the outdoor seating area yes correct is that being used will that be used as part of the cafe is that what your question is no whether you have any knowledge of it being used in connection with the commercial premises um no so they currently don't have any outdoor seating okay and you're not aware of that area having been used as part of the commercial property in the past um no there wasn't anything I didn't see any conditions of consent previously in relation to outdoor seating or any comments in the previous assessment reports that mentioned outdoor seating though thank you um also in relation to um the report on starting on probably page 25 of 34 that you're looking at there's a there's draft conditions of consent do you have those draft conditions of consent uh of the sorry of the planning panel report yes yes I've got that in front of me yes correct okay do are proposed to be imposed or recommended to be imposed sorry I'll just pull it up uh 20 it was page 25 was it starts on page 25 and goes for a number of pages okay over to recommendations or if you just bear with me once again too there's people the front windows uh no I did notice that the so the hours of operation we were aware of um the food and drinks requirements we were aware of um the the only the only thing that I thought might have been of an issue for stella uh would be the lack of signage that was being approved but it says that a sign can be erected at the front boundary of the property um no that's it that was I didn't have any issues stella might have an issue with the signage that wasn't being approved thank you thank you um ronda and stella I don't think we have any more uh questions on this development application so we will now move on to the next development application that's panel will make its decision on this one that decision will be placed on on council's website within the next week but thank you very much both of you for your attendance um and your assistance of the panel this evening thank you for your time thanks thank you good night okay so that brings us to item 6.2 at this meeting which is 1579 botany road botany this is a modification application to amend the hours of operation for an existing petrol station use and to a 24 hour seven days a week use and we have a number of people the officer's recommendation is for refusal and we have a number of people registered to speak in support of that officer's recommendation and we also have mr warwick stimson who is registered to speak in against the officer's recommendation of refusal so what we'll do is hear first from the members of the community that are registered to speak against sorry in support of the refusal and then we'll ask mr simpson to respond to any of the issues that he'd previous speakers so first on my list I have ms rachel thornton who's an affected neighbor are you there miss thorn thornton she hasn't joined me oh yes sorry I apologize can hear me okay yeah we can hear you thank you so um I'll ask all of the speakers to please confine your comments to three minutes and mr will let you know once you've reached two minutes and then if you can make your concluding comments once he's let you know that you've reached two minutes also there's no need to repeat what others have said so really if you just like to make any comments that haven't yet been raised by previous speakers that would be helpful for the panel so mrs thornton if you'd like to address the panel thank you very much firstly thank you for allowing me to speak this evening I'm one of the many affected families in single story dwellings living directly opposite this site we are all of course in favor of the council officers decision to refuse this application and the eu epa under schedule one reasons for refusal we would like to second these in particular as well surely based on the fact that an independent assessment of this application has concluded there is quote insufficient quote misleading and quote inaccurate information provided this d.a must be refused an independent acoustic consultant reflects the concerns of local residents regarding section 4.15 1b of the epa quote that approval of this da is likely to cause adverse acoustic impact it is confirmed by all third parties concerned that approval would go directly against council lep and dcp as well not just in regards to acoustic impact but new south wales police object to the extension of ours due to crime risk in our community as well I'd like to confirm the panel members if they have watched the eight minute video I submitted with my request to speak as it truly illustrates the severe current impact caused by the site and the stark contrast of the nighttime amenity restored to us once this site shuts at 10 pm each evening my most recent letter of objection highlighted 11 points points in the dcp examples lep to ensure the protection and improvement of amenity and of the residential areas and in particular residential amenity health and safety are maintained and improved dcp objective 16 to ensure non-residential development maintains the amenity of surrounding residential developments I've tried to provide the panel all the factual evidence you need to refuse this da in my letter I am personally mentally and physically exhausted from the strain caused by this site both in daily impact and constantly reapplying with misleading information it takes hundreds of hours to unpack this and prove impact that is obvious blind freddy can see that this truck stop is the cause of so much impact in our community in summary I implore you all in your important role of making this decision to look at the site in relation to its surroundings holistically consider how much impact it is likely to cause how much it already causes all of us also consider the acknowledgement of misleading and inaccurate information provided by the applicant on multiple occasions please refuse this application and ensure the protection of our community day thank you very much thank you miss thornton and I can confirm that the panel did receive your video and has looked at that video and also that the panel members have attended the site and had first-hand experience of of that site and the activities on that site wonderful thank you very much again for your time thanks miss thornton and we now have mr andrew lamparelli I can see you're there mr lamparelli oh yes I am can you hear me we can hear you well thank you okay firstly I'd like to uh thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight um there's a couple of things I wanted to talk about firstly the changing um immigration I just ask you I'm assuming that you live um in the residential area behind directly across the road from the bp yeah the point I was going to make botany's changing so much council it's become more residential all the trucking companies around botany have more or less disappeared now I was reading something that where botany council I have spent 54 was a mess letter saying what they were doing around banks meadow and botany now having spent so much money on beautifying the area and having cafes and it's really wrong to have these trucks coming into botany especially 24 hours a day now this is something that's not needed the way botany has changed but on the personal level what I want to talk about is I live across directly across the road and my bedroom faces the garage now the bp can't abide by their da as it is now they operate till 10 o'clock at night and open at 6. now we have deliveries coming in starting at 4 30. there's trucks uh banging doors milk deliveries it's impossible to get eight hours sleep I'm also talking on behalf of my mother that lives across the road from me and she's an elderly woman this is really affecting our health like already operating until 10 o'clock at night and opening at six in the morning we're not getting eight hours sleep at night it's really affecting from half past four in the morning it makes it impossible I've also complained numerous times that they have their waste collection sometimes between 12 o'clock and and 2 o'clock in the morning I'm talking about the big trucks that come and bang away they to collect their rubbish I'm talking about industrial industrial bins now I don't know how many times I've complained I also went out to film one of these uh occasions where the club never actually threatened me he wanted me to stop recording and he threatened me now this shouldn't this vp shouldn't have been built in a residential area in the first place it should have been built at the port now I'm asking the panel please please don't subject us to any more grief than what we're getting already now as a former police officer I checked the way the consent was given to build this truck stop and there's a lot of question marks what I'm asking the panel now is not to condemn us for the wrongs trucks at night there's less traffic on botany road so these trucks are coming down botany road at a higher speed than normal then when they reach the bp they hit the brakes these containers are shaking all over the place and they turn in at a higher speed which makes more noise than what it does in during the day now the pollution that the dangers that are associated with this I'm asking the panel please knock it on the head don't let it go through now another thing you're out of time so if you just make your final comments please my last uh point is also not it's only affecting our health but it's a it's affected the value of our properties I did a search with another property similar to mine only 50 meters away that don't have the trucks coming and there's a difference of around 250 000 now if this goes 24 hours my my home is worth nothing practically because no person is going to want to live across the road with um you very much thanks mr lamparelli uh next we have mrs alexia mack you there mrs mack calling now hello mrs mack is that is that alexia mack yep it is oh thanks for joining the meeting mrs mack you've got three minutes so if you'd like to uh say what you'd like to say to the panel please and I'm assuming that you'll you live in close proximity to the service station if you just explain to the panel exactly where it is that your property is in relation to this station not a problem uh thank you for hearing me tonight I'm a resident with a young family who lives directly opposite the site in question all the residents living directly opposite have either young children of their own or at all as grandparents regularly mine their grandkids the community of botany has changed over time from being an industrial area to one of families we bought in botany 11 years ago as it was becoming known as the area for families with young children we were well aware and accepting of the pm at the time their hours have already been extended once to 10 pm on a trial period with high flow diesel off at 9 pm on regular occasions there are trucks filling up after 9 00 pm and also waiting before the opening at 6 am whilst trucks over 12.5 meters aren't supposed to travel past hill street they surely do some trucks come only for their drivers to get food and whilst they leave their motors idling and then not to mention the use of air brakes within the within with on botany road no reports can highlight the effects noise has on residents when you have traffic noise for all all of those hours when you're up with a young child working or just trying to unwind after the day it is non-stop can you imagine if you were having to listen to that noise throughout the night while trying to sleep every night as well and whilst the application advises no high slow diesel traps between midnight and 4 30 a.m there isn't compliance with the current times so what is to say being excluded from these times the application is requesting 24 7 for that service so there won't be a break with young children in the house their health is at the forefront of our objection traffic noise has been identified by health authorities as being abrupt noise and any interruption would lead to sleep disruption and this just isn't in kids but adults as well the sleep disruption won't just be for the immediate residents but all residents along the route the traffic takes to get to the bp station in and out studies have shown night noise travels much further than daytime there is no 24-hour training businesses within the immediate area of vp botany community is continuing to grow as pointed out in councillor's bank meadow newtown center pamphlet council councillors have a vision to enhance and complement this growth this application does not do this if this application was to be approved we also have concern that the especially as a gathering place by I've only got a very small mark by customers who already walked past after leaving the pub also is already a known issue within bayside if this application was to be approved it would be set as a precedent for other businesses to apply for 24-hour trade while with what the community does not need this we are in support of the council officers decision to refuse this application thank you for hearing me tonight an apology for my voice as school has started back I seem to come down with a head cold from my child oh gee thank you mrs mack I'm sorry that you you've got your head cold from your child oh you know what happens when the school goes back I'm sure it'll be happening all over the place but thank you for um for addressing the panel this evening thank you for having me we now have mr warren totten are you there mr totten yes I am if you'd like to address the panel please and if you could try to keep your comments to um three minutes and mr soup will let you know once you've reached two minutes thank you very much thank talk about this um I've been looking through the bayside council development control plan for botany south now the plan b section is guidelines which are not in keeping with this application the council can refer their own guidelines uh 9b 413 the redevelopment of this area is to provide a transition from non-residential to surrounding residential uses and this does not this track stop which if you look on google earth it says it's a truck stop does not go in with this b7 zone at the moment a truck has just pulled in here it's a b double which is not supposed to be up here and it is it is doing a delivery to this place um health-wise it affects everyone's sleep padding patterns um we are it's just completely ridiculous the way they are we've caught them early opening they don't stick by what they said they will do and to to actually have deliveries 24 7. it's not like it used to be where you had flowing out of the tankers into the tanks lpg gas is's going to happen 24 7 if this people goes on thank you very much for listening to me but that's yeah we've just I've just had to close my front windows because of these trucks just coming in now one just one just arrived as if it's a big double which is not supposed to be on botany road up here thank you thanks mr totten for taking the time to um come and speak to the panel this evening it's appreciated our last uh speaker speaking against speaking for the officer's recommendation for refusal is counsellor um scott morrissey are you there councillor morrissey yes sam madam chair can hear me okay we can hear you well thanks excellent thank you um thank you for your guidance I'm not going to try I'll try not to repeat what's already been said by our residents um I live approximately 500 metres from the site so I I'm talking as a resident but also on behalf of numerous residents who have contacted me and asked me to speak to the officers report and the detail the issues raised particularly the fact that they've gone to an independent acoustic consultant who has provided more facts in relation to the flaws in in the report provided by the by the applicant I think people often forget that there's low rise housing to the south and the impacts to the north of botany road um certainly the the I'm sorry the impacts that businesses have on those residents on the north side the the residents as you've heard um accept the status quo they understand the operation they understand the nature of botany but rightfully resist change that is going to have negative impacts to their livelihoods one of the important things that stood out for me and a lot of residents was the fact that the new south wales police do not support this application due to at le 11 crime risks at a medium rated level that will impact the area the the um the adverse acoustic impacts have have largely been being talked about here but I just want to say in my personal view the deceptive deceptive comments there given that they have not undertaken an attended noise uh attended noise measurements they've done this with computer modeling and modeled at various other times but they haven't actually been there to understand the ambient noise and and the impacts it's going to have on residents and to conclude in the report that sleep disturbance is not anticipated and that there are no noise-related issues is completely false and if people would spend the time with our residents and with our with our locals they would understand the impacts that this is having on our community as as is noted in the summary of the report as is noted in summary report there's there's been 73 submissions there's been two petitions the two petitions were obtained in a period of six days had the had our groups uh locally and our residents had more time those those numbers would have certainly increased we've got 440 odd objections to this proposal and I think that voice about the community is loud and clear there so without wanting to repeat others not in the public interest and this is consistent with the determination weight made by the botany bay city council way back in 2013 where the council was concerned with the environmental and social impacts of the noise the fumes the traffic and anti-social behavior this is going to set if approved this will set an undesirable precedent that as evidenced by local residents is not appropriate at this location and therefore I implore you to agree and endorse with the officer's recommendation thanks for your time thanks councillor morrissey do any panel members have any questions for any of the speakers this evening you're all very clear and um um eloquent in in communicating your concerns about the proposal so I don't have any questions but um just checking if there are any questions from the panel no all right thanks panel um we now have mr warwick stimson uh who's registered to speak on behalf of the applicant and he's he's speaking against the officer's recommendation of refusal are you there mr stimson yes I am can you hear me we minutes but if you if you could um in particular address um the issues that have been raised by the speakers including a number of them have referred to non-compliances with the existing approved hours if you've got any comments to make about that please yeah sure uh thanks for the opportunity to speak to the panel tonight just listening to the uh presenters just then there were three things I just wanted to note um first thing is the compliance with the lep and the dcp as noted in the office's report to the panel this evening the second thing was there's no record of substantiated complaints against or compliance action against the operator of the site that we are aware of and um obviously that influenced the way that we presented the application to council the third thing that I wanted to note was the previous agenda item for napoleon street council noted or united met and chair the visiting with the council as to the hours operation prior to tonight's meeting now that's important because the previous application that we lodged for covert pandemic and the inability to obtain accurate acoustic data through that period um but in that application there was a peer review of the acoustic report that we had submitted at the time and we were afforded an opportunity to respond to that peer review at the time for this application a different acoustic consultant was selected by council to peer review our assessment and we've not had an opportunity to respond to council and I'm hoping the panel's been furnished with my submission one page submission on the 28th of october requesting that this matter be deferred from tonight's meeting because had we had the opportunity to review that peer review there are matters that our acoustic consultant believes can be responded to and compliance with all of the requirements in an acoustic sense met um those changes are outlined in that letter and I trust the panel has that letter I can um in addition to that uh there are a number of matters that have advanced in that peer review that our acoustic uh consultant um I think should be afforded the the overall application we think out of um uh you know in the spirit of fairness we need time to do that prepare or undertake some additional logging and present some amendments to the application that we think would be far more palatable to the surrounding residents thank you thanks mr stinson any questions for mr simpson or any comments from the panel nothing all right well thank you very much all of the speakers this evening the panel um very much appreciates you all taking the time to address us and it helps us to better understand the um the proposal just for your information you can be assured that we've all read the council assessment report as I said attended the site uh during operation of the business and also uh read a summary of the um submissions that have been made and objections that have been made in relation to the development application so what will happen now is that the meeting will close and the panel will make its determination of each of the um development applications this is a modification application on our agenda council's website um within within a week um so again excuse me thank you very much for your attendance this evening and you can leave the meeting now and you'll um by checking the website of council you'll you'll um be able to read the council the panel's determination within the next seven days thank you thank you thank you very much checking um I'll just close uh facebook sonny can you guys facebook please so you
Hi welcome and thank you for joining us for today's lunch and learn session on dementia friendly communities with anthony parker from dementia australia um before we begin I would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which I am working today the gadigal and vidigal people of the uranation the people of the uranation their spirits and ancestors will always remain with our waterways and the land our mother earth I would also like to pay my respects to elders past present and emerging bayside council has been running free online lunch and learn sessions daily to help our community stay connected active and well during lockdown so please follow us on eventbrite to view our weekly program and all other events hosted by council I'll add the link to the chat for you to follow up with okay so today's session is being delivered in recognition of dementia action week which was last week and international day of older persons which is coming up on friday the 1st of october now before I introduce anthony I would just like to ask that you will be able to unmute yourself to do this at the time but you can also add your questions to the chat and we'll get to them at the end um so anthony parker is the program officer for dementia friendly communities at dementia australia hi anthony thank you so much for joining us are you ready to go yes I am carly thank you very much all right so um yes uh nice to see everyone we'll meet everyone I'll just start sharing my screen just so just give me a moment and beginning okay um can everyone say that yes now I think you might be saying it in um presentation view rather than slide view um yeah okay um yep sorry I know what to do I've shared it the wrong way so just give me a moment okay so I'll start that again okay is that better perfect thank you all right great so um so creating a dementia friendly community it really is uh all about individuals starting at the grassroots level uh all of us together play a really made up of the collective actions and decisions that each of us make every day in this presentation I'm going to be talking about the impact of dementia what a dementia friendly community is some practical practical examples of dementia friendly communities a process for getting started and ways we can all take action so to start with it's really important to say that it is possible to live well with dementia while there currently is no cure for dementia a diagnosis is not the end of the story it's really about partnering with people living with dementia so that everyone can live well in the community in their community and this is the goal of the dementia friendly communities program it's also important to understand that when you've met a person with dementia you've only met one person with dementia there are over a hundred conditions that cause dementia and there are many many symptoms of dementia and everybody's journey with dementia is unique so it's really important not to stereotype now how can we all live well with or do looking after our heart doing some physical activity a healthy diet social activity and mentally challenging our brains these are things that can reduce our risk of developing dementia but as the research studies show we cannot guarantee that any individual that even if they do everything right they won't get dementia as there are many factors both modifiable and non-modifiable which influences a person's risk of developing dementia back in 2019 uh dementia australia commissioned a survey the discrimination survey and these are some of the results that we we gathered around the impact of dementia so as you can see three out of four people living with dementia said people don't keep in touch with them 65 said people they now have been avoiding them since their diagnosis 71 of family members friends or carers say that they have not been included in family activities and 81 of people said people in shops cafes and restaurants treat people with dementia differently so what these statistics clearly show is that the impact of dementia is not limited limited to the physical symptoms of the of psychosocial and emotional needs of people living with dementia and how they're clearly being disregarded even if it's not always intentional but it is obvious that people with dementia are being discriminated against so a dementia friendly community is about creating change and reversing some of these statistics we have a couple of quotes here from people living with dementia around their experiences after they diagnosed this and as you can see it's sometimes not just about the diagnosis it's about losing friends people living with dementia often find their social circles are significantly diminished and they also often experience embarrassment or humiliation when they have an issue or a difficulty out in the community and they don't receive that little bit of extra support or patience from others that would make such a big difference to them and actually give them the confidence to engage in community activities that the rest of us take for granted I'd like us to just do a a bit of a reflection now um can you think of a time when you were excluded and how did of being excluded over the last 18 months being in in with covert and being in lockdown but I'll just share a personal example that's happened to me recently an ex-colleague and friend of mine recently passed away unexpectedly and I was not able to attend their funeral due to lockdown now apart from the grief I experienced that losing a friend being excluded from the funeral was very very upsetting and caused me to feel deeply depressed for several days I can only imagine that people living with dementia feel this kind of loss and depression at being excluded on a regular basis now the kinds of things that might help um to reduce that exclusion uh if you're in an unfamiliar place people smiling at you you know just just just a smile goes a long way someone saying hello looking at you directly with a friendly manner and tone of voice and asking how you are and if you are confused if you don't know where you are someone asking if you need help and giving you directions these are really simple things little bit of awareness and a little bit of willingness on on our part to really be the change that we're looking for in the community so what do you think makes a community dementia friendly and I'd encourage you to put your comments in the chat if you'd like if you have some input around what you think makes a community dementia friendly and I'll just start off by saying being inclusive is a good start but if you have anything that you'd like to add in the chat please please do so and we can come back to that later um if you are not familiar with using zoom um and and not sure how to use the chat you can unmute yourself to ask questions throughout okay so now I have a video to play of people living with dementia talking about their aspirations for what a dementia friendly community might look like um the sound is kind of coming broken up can I just check that everyone can hear that um it's not sounding great on my end okay um I'm just gonna stop the sharing and go back okay we can hear it now thank you the dementia friendly community to me would be one where people with dementia would feel included they'd feel safe they'd be able to enjoy activities that they've always enjoyed one word is acceptance that we're the same people it would be somebody who would be willing to explain things again dementia friendly community to me would be a community that understands of uh what you're going through one way we can ask for help and just receive it without being looked at because if yes you know you're strange you can get help off of off other people and stuff there's great amount of uh support there it looks like any other community the real difference is that people are just a little bit more aware of what it's like to have dementia for any community to become more dementia friendly it has to begin with the individuals fear of the unknown is the thing that that brings out the best now and then the moral knowledge that they know of dementia would be a big plus then they might understand what I am going through I don't think we can expect people to be able to be dementia friendly if they haven't had any education on how to be dementia friendly I think the community could be more adventure friendly by um by information more than anything the first step I think in being dementia friendly is uh education people like us can get out there and and have talks with them the stigma is removed from dementia they understand it you know not everybody's the same and it would be good if people were more aware not think that I was silly or stupid or dumb because I can't remember what I'm trying to say I'd just like people to talk to me just to come up and say hello at the checkout if you were having sort of trouble getting money from your purse or something it would be nice if people if I was lost didn't just sort of the more people are aware the better they are able to um understand and provide that little bit of assistance where it's required yeah you just gotta get the ball started don't you just social friendliness that's mainly the key there's nothing more to me enjoyable than walking around in a community that I know um if I have issues will not shun me but will actually help I would feel comfortable because I would know that there are people at the shopping centre that have been educated with uh through people talking to them about how to treat people with dementia he would make it a lot easier he would make my life with a community that understands that would make my life a lot easier communities needs to involve the person that has dementia if you're trying to make things better for people with dementia without actively involving them in the process you're wasting your time and you're wasting their time and unfortunately their time is more limited than yours embrace braces so we're still part of the treat you as as a normal person yeah you got to be able to have a laugh that was one of my other sort of things you know you got to have a laugh every day I just have this wonderful picture of um a community whether it be a small community it'd be like just a street even whether it be a town or whether it be a capital city it would have some respect for people with dementia sorry about that okay so um yeah we asked the experts uh what is a dementia friendly community and these are some of the quotes that we received so as you can see it's really about being inclusive uh any type of vulnerability is included feeling that you belong and feeling that you won't be judged and also where people don't feel left out and they feel comfortable and safe in their surroundings excuse me so we came up with one definition of what a dementia friendly community is and this is just one definition there are many so this one is a place purpose meaning and value where people living with dementia are included and can make their own choices so getting started in your community the first thing is to ask and involve people living with dementia and to coin a phrase a very popular phrase nothing about us without us which is has become the rallying cry of dementia dementia alliance international who have said working together we will improve the lives of people with dementia and our families it is not acceptable to continue to do anything about us without us so it's about walking beside people living with dementia now I'd like to talk about a few communities that have taken action in the dementia friendly community space and really done some amazing and incredible things first of all the dementia friendly hammer project which began in 2014 and has led to a number of social inclusion act inclusion activities and a real shift in community attitudes secondly the lithgow dementia alliance's creative dementia workshop project which was a series of ten fortnightly workshops combining mindfulness music therapy and art therapy as well as a support this year from january to june and also thirdly the sun georgian southern alliance's getting to know you project which was a joint project between the alliance and irani choc bringing people living with dementia and children under five together for uh fun laughter playing and sharing and just on this and george and southern alliance it began in 2019 as a project convened by three bridges community which is a not-for-profit community organisation based in this george area the alliance consists of people living with dementia carers and representatives from sutherland shire council southeast sydney local health district calgary community health gomer community aid and information services ibis aged care hammond care gomer community I sorry I already said that uh narani childcare blakehurst high school and willis and bearing solicitors so I'm going to play a couple of videos now uh which highlights these projects so I'm just going to stop sharing and I'm going to share another screen stay with me can everybody say that yes we can see that okay so this is uh about the climate dementia friendly project well the event advisory group and the alliance the advisor group been made up exclusively to people living with dementia and all their care partners and the alliance been a broader coalition of services and organizations in individuals interested in dementia or working the service delivery space so we've had nearly 1400 people I think come to community education across the the three or four years of the project so the key activities involved in that has actually been providing a program about the lived experience of dementia to provide people in the kaima community with an opportunity to actually meet people that have dementia I feel it's our job to remind people and then create a dementia friendly environment whether it is for the hour for the day how can you tell that someone has dementia until you actually get involved with them the community education programs have been really good particularly the one that we had the other day with the meals on wheels people and he had lots and lots of answers for people who asked questions on things relating to anatomy to behaviour a whole answer and it was just magnificent that he also has dementia himself and they could see like it's not the end of the world for everyone that people get on and have can have a really good interesting life we've had several projects running at the same time one was the social dancing with dementia which runs over about six week period every friday and people living with dementia their care partners invited along to have an afternoon of dancing and socializing and music also the music and memory program started at the beginning of probably the beginning of last year people have been donating ipods so that families can download individual music for the person living with dementia that associates them with their memories the other one is the animal kinship it's a lady that works in the town in a company called animal kinship and the partnership between her and blue haven dementia facility has actually been taken in these um virtual pets and saying what the response is rather than a cat or a dog or rabbit and the therapeutic response it had on which is important and we had a basis upon which other research has been done one day I said look let's just go ahead now that we've implemented this but let's took about 15 of these animals up and I put them along you know the environment in the day area and we said let's just see now what happens well that was where the the magic hit and it was almost they were just a trigger for some kind of so they were communicating they were talking to each other but for me it was the smiling and this coming you could see the light in their eyes they were just coming forward and they would be touching and holding these it was a joy I've had the privilege of working in a dementia friendly environment and now I'm also whilst I'm studying I'm working in a cafe in the climate community and just getting a bit more out there about what I'm doing outside of the cafe and trying to spread the word about it I do think it feel welcome um a lot of cafes don't which I know which when I've been speaking to their carers or their family and that's what they've said about us we just a little bit of fuss not too much just make them feel welcome to start their day off nice and that's what we do here we don't single anybody out everybody's equal and I think that's what all cafes need to do so we had quite a lot of work around dementia design principles and how we design residential aged care facilities and we were really interested in trying to understand what makes a friendly community environment so being able to again work with people with dementia and design a tool that we could use to audit public buildings like our local supermarket or like our local library and to use the information that was generated from that audit process to both make improvements in the physical environment that meant that people that with dementia that were navigating and negotiating those environments could achieve what they went in there to achieve actually having changes in the way they will in some cases operate businesses or treat people and even just casual people on the street being involved in this project I can start to see changes that are affecting people's lives on a daily basis and it's not only the local community now it's uh really globally oh look the biggest unexpected outcome has been the global recognition of the work that we've done here in kyama so that felt like just normal work to me but we kept on getting told that there's something special happening here I think the fact that people with dementia have been very involved people with a good background in education certainly has made a difference most people I've spoken to find the hardest thing is actually getting people with dementia involved in the first place the more people are involved the easier it's going to become and I tend to think that what we're looking at is going to be a generational change rather than a short-term quick change we have to recognize some people to be socially excluded and stigmatised so one of the things that we learnt from our project was the importance of mentoring by people with dementia for people with dementia the important thing to understand is that um you need to know the community in which you're working this is one of the you know the shared values and expertise that the university has brought to our project the university of wollongong the advice I'd always give to other projects trying to work in this space is start with something small something that you can achieve because success breeds success so if you find to start to get some traction in this space then go with that don't don't doggedly stick to something because that's what you plan to do initially so we're beginning to explore the ways for the community coalition like ours can have in actually also advocating for better services and service development for people with dementia and we believe that those services will be transformed in a similar way through contact with people with dementia for example when we ideas that we hadn't thought of and our challenge is to try and adapt their best practice into what we can do here and make changes here so I'll stop sharing that um and I'll go back to my powerpoint um and I think carly in the interest of time I may not play the second video as uh is that uh is that okay yeah no that's okay and I think what we might be able to do is follow up with everyone who registered for this session um with a few links to to additional resources and videos um that they might have missed out on today sure okay so can you see the powerpoint presentation again yep all right so um so in summary um as you can see dementia really is everybody's business the number of people with a diagnosis of dementia is going to more than double between now and 2060 from currently about 475 000 to over a million people so it is everybody's business and it really does start at a grassroots level it starts with is here to support communities to do that and I i would encourage everybody to go on to the dementia friendly community's website dementiafriendly.org.ou and have a look at the resources there and sign up to become a dementia friend and complete the 20 minute dementia friends module which will give you a bit of awareness of how to be more dementia friendly when you're out there in the community so final thoughts um people with the lived experience really are the wisdom holders of the dementia friendly community which is only truly achievable and sustainable if people with a lived experience are at the heart of that community inclusion and enablement arises from walking with their lived experience and wisdom which promotes a self-sufficient and self-sustaining community and by everyone being here today we're all planting seeds to grow the environment for change so to borrow from the hopi indian philosophy together we are the ones we have been waiting for so now to any questions that people might have everyone should be able to unmute themselves now and thank you anthony
Well thank you very much allison for inviting me to give this talk and to bayside council and for your introduction to country um the title and uh the theme are dictated in part by the fact that I have only 20 minutes to speak I shall try to keep this within 20 minutes and I'm happy to be cut off at that point but the the subject matter we've now gone through two slides by the way so we need to go back one um the subject matter is the cook's river and I've been it's been necessary for me to focus on a couple of key themes I was because of the timelines I was once asked what are the really big things that happened to the cook river and of course I was I felt that everything was important and I'd written about in my book river dreams nevertheless when when faced this question I just out of the blue nominated two things um the dam and the airport and and the the questioner kind of agreed with that this these's what I'm going to talk about today the cooks river was not named until 1798 but it was explored by cook and his men uh during the the visit in 1770 to botany bay and since the 19 since the uh 1798's been called it was called cook's river in the way that it is on the screen with the apostrophe since the 1970s it's been called the cooks river it's still a european indeed a sort of colonial name uh an aboriginal name has not been forthcoming although the term goliath the place of the pelican has been suggested but there is not agreement among aboriginal people to accept that name um possibly because uh a number of different uh clans did inhabit the area of the cooks river valley particularly the gadigal which I'm most familiar with and the wonga are upstream but others as well the medical and the gamagal as well now the book does deal with a lot of different things including the aesthetics of the environmental transformation of the culture but in this talk I just want australian approach to the cooked river was a combination of instrumentalism perhaps I should have said utilitarianism and aesthetic appreciation the river was to be used for water for animals and even humans it was to supplement sydney's water supply that was actually damned or it didn't work but it was also appreciated for its beauty and there's always been this tension between the two in the history of the european occupation of the cooks river valley but it was also uh but um but the latter the the appreciation for its beauty tend to come all second best okay next next please next okay so to enhance the supply of water for the colony the river was damned in 1839 40 using convict labor and giant sandstone blocks which had to be hauled into place by very primitive means this was the first great change the river and it was done to inaugurate sydney's water supply it was during the during a great drought um now this this action had ecological and hydro hydrological effects especially it eliminated the upstream tides destroying the remaining uh uh europeans wanting to make soap where after burning the the the branches and it impeded fish stock movement so it was ruinous to upstream fishing at the time pollution and siltation increased above and below the dam this is very significant because the river was itself a river that did was quite muddy and it did naturally accumulate a fair amount of siltation but this increased dramatically in the 19th century due to urbanization but when it got to the dam which was built in 1839-40 couldn't go any further and moreover downstream the flow of the river was affected as well not because there was no tidal movement or very limited title more limited tidal movement pollution also uh accumulated especially above the dam but also below the dam and and flooding very bad flooding now ironically the water was not suitable for human drinking purposes although it was used for time for animals on the farms around there this was because the sandstone blocks that were in place as the dam actually let quite a lot of the salt water through next slide please next okay was supposed to in fact it just exaggerated flooding on the river it didn't provide the right supply of water that was required and so on and so forth and it increased the accumulation of pollution so the dam was modified in the 1860s but more so in 1897 1898 as you'll see in the coming illustrations but it was actually not taken down until the 1960s despite what you will read on some of the plaques along the river next please well samuel elliott did this watercolour of cooked river at the tempe dam in 1866 and this is quite an idyllic representation but when you see there is a photograph that's similar for the same position and it shows very it's very similar so it wasn't it wasn't an inaccurate representation really now you can what you're looking at there on the in the lower part of it is the dam where the dam has gone over the river that's then become uh a highway or a road anyway across the bridge it was actually a toll road and on hand side of the entrance to the bridge at the bottom you can see the um uh the toll booth I think you should go further to your left to find this I don't have control of that but you'll see the little little toll uh that's it there yeah right now just to the right of that you'll see that there have been some uh hulls put in the dam that's like sluices to allow the water to flow through and that's because the dam just wasn't working the way it was supposed to to work and flooding was extreme um it's interesting that this picture makes the river look very placid and quiet above the dam very very uh mirror-like and actually that was quite true and that's because um there was no tidal flow it was the main thing that was to keep the cooker alive so it was very still and frequently the the um reports on the on the on the river upstream you know emphasized how still it was um but that wasn't good the silk flowing downstream could only go as far as sedan okay next one next okay so in 1897 1898 there was a big change and this bridge has put over the cooks river a proper bridge above the dam standing on stilts not a very good bit of overexposed this uh slide but you can see the actual bridge there trams went across that um it was a fairly narrow bridge two lane bridge uh not like the current six lane bridge below that sluice gates were put in which had to be manually occupied and you can see each of those and one of those actually broken because this was take this picture was taken during the 1946 floods and 94 through to the 1948 floods in that period there was just tremendous floods and that damaged these flu skates they did it didn't work very well they were quite inadequate but they did lead to some mitigation of the flood issue so you can see that um that's that's um that's the effects of the attempts to modify the dam now if we one please next okay now this is just a map which is a representation of what the vegetation landscape was like at the time of european settlement taken from doug uh benson's book on the uh crooks river vegetation and uh if you can it's hard but you can probably see you can see the outline on the right hand side of the current airport if you go south you can see the runway is extending off into the bay and if you go just up a little bit and you'll see the serpentine ridge and then there's a kind of rectangle little rectangular stretcher yeah there and that was where the first um uh rectification work was done to try to relieve the siltation problem just a little bit upstream from there if we go around up the river there a little bit that's what back back that's where the dam is or was right there right here right here where the um yeah right now so further south further further to this yeah there that's right okay so that's the and you can see all the tributes of the river there as well now we go on to the next one um okay now what I just because of this being done for bayside council I wanted to emphasize that a large part of what is now the cooked river completely forgets about and excludes as did the previous map the existence of what I call the eastern catchment of the river and this um geological uh sketch um comes out to do with uh what has become sydney water up as an authority uh uh all of the uh all of the parts north of the river that uh that I have a uh uh the donor aren't etched in that is what I would call the eastern catchment this whole area it goes up as far as centennial park and so it encompasses randwick part of rainbow council and down through our through the current golf course and to near the entrance to the entrance of the river and uh to the west of that or to the east on the illustration that you're looking at also part of this area so all of that was alluvial and blown sand and water flowing through it down to what is now the mill stream and that area was part of the culture river valley it's no longer considered part of it it's it's a subject of considerable historical amnesia the people who lived in the botany region knew about the cooks river that was their river and they have those people who are old enough to remember it going there going through that area of botany they also they have strong memories of it and we go on to the next one and this from a uh on the maps that says today in in uh uh atlas of sydney it says 1886 1888 rather it's actually 1886 because it doesn't have the new work that was being done in the 1886 1888 period to relieve siltation on the lower river but again you can see very clearly the stream coming from the east in near the mouth of the cooks river to the west of that or to the left-hand side now known as rockdale and the rest and botany on the right-hand side of that and up in the left-hand corner there is shae's creek which was becoming uh in the next couple of years after that of the alexandria canal as it is today the most polluted waterway in the whole cooks river system right let's go on to the next slide please okay so the cox river in the 19th century did have some utilitarian functions but it was also a place of attachment people did like the river it was a it was considered a lovely place despite the problems that were accumulating it was a place for fishing swimming boating and all kinds of recreational activities yachting all right so so forth please go on to the next please okay so for example puck's wolf in botany in 1926 this uh this picture um is um in the area covered by the airport now so in the period of the late 19th century and early 20th century young people would come here and swim this is on the north side of the river that in 1927 a bridge was put at exactly this point over to the south side and through to kaima and on to brighton with sands in that area there there was a bridge put down the following year and when that happened the um the swimmers used to dive off that bridge into the river which was said to be shark infested as well they were bull sharks in the river and uh people didn't seem to worry too much about it I didn't see any reports of people being taken by sharks in the river at that time can we go on to the next one okay and this is taken from upstream but there was a huge amount of boating downstream as well this is a very uh wonderful image of the kind of edwardian period in which um the residents of the cooks river valley would take their picnics on the riverside and would go boating on the river I talk quite a lot a lot about this in my book river dreams so that there were 110 um boats that could be hired 20th century so there could be a lot of craft on the river a long time since then that the craft have been absent and they're coming back at this time let's go on to the next one next um swimming was very popular and uh indeed it was um mainly males or almost exclusively male as far as I know and uh it was a nude swimming is and this is not just a representation this is actually what did happen at least part of their their young boys would come down strip off the clothes go in the river much to the shock and uh horror of the ladies who were swimming who were sorry um boating by uh on their craft um sydney long the the painter painted this by tranquil waters in 1894 and it's in the art gallery of new south wales it's not on display as far as I know at the moment but I actually have seen it on display and you'll see in the foreground you'll see uh uh pan the mythical figure is uh actually were to the boys to enter the water so so swimming was a was a big activity in the 19th century uh cooks river and um it was so despite growing pollution problems and uh but it also this picture reveals the kind of arcadian landscape idea that the cooks river was a place of pastoral beauty which was appropriate an aesthetically pleasing landscape which I talk a lot about in the book on to the next one next now contrast that image with the 1950s to 1990s where we have images like this in the newspaper on the sun's river of death this is the result of a cyanide discharge upstream in which many many tens of thousands of fish were destroyed and the river was rendered uninhabitable go on to the next one and downstream pollution greatly affected the river too and this is muddy creek near vistik street uh picture of pollution in 1991. so from the 1950s to the 1990s was probably the nadira of the cooks river as far as a place for boating for certainly for swimming and for fishing in fact fishing valley from 1951 until uh may even still be banned but certainly banned until recently next one the faults of the dam and the subsequent build-up pollution induced other big changes to remedy the flaws in the building of the dam on this small river the most obvious was the channelising of the river which was designed to convey pollution away and to keep the river flowing in conjunction with the introduction of the sluice gates as I showed it in earlier illustration and this profoundly altered the river's aesthetics and turned it into a kind of industrial landscape a kind of drain so we can go to the next uh slide please next so here we see campsie upstream the riverbank around 1900. still an amazingly large amount of of original indigenous vegetation on the river at that time you can see people um paddling in the stream at that point in the sort of middle section of that picture uh but now contrast that with the later picture of the same area so this is the modern uh upstream uh cooks river it's been channelized and that affected people's um appreciation of the river now mind you a lot of people thought that this was a neat solution to the problems that had emerged the problems of pollution of siltation uh you know the jamming up of drains with um with bottles pot plastic and all that sort of stuff and the oil spills etc this could all be conveyed it could all be changed by the introduction of these neat concrete banks this was a common uh a common thing done at the time this is a kind of engineering modernism which would solve these problems of of streams in urban areas we'll go on to the next one please also upstream look at cup and saucer creek at flood time in 1901 and it's a raging torrent admittedly that's a you know because there's a lot of water flowing that gives a very strong image there's a kind of niagara falls it wasn't quite that big it was a natural feature compared with what has subsequently happened to it look what the next slide and what it drain I call that that is what we that's what we have today although I've been some changes uh near the near the mouth of coming source of creek to improve that situation so concrete uh engineering let's go on to the next uh now the timing of this this these changes to the river and the introduction of of the channelizing and the other changes including the coming of the airport near the mouth of river uh are important to any historian from saying when did these things happen and if you look at this picture you're looking at mascot in 1939 and you can barely make out in the right middle you can see the runways they crisscrossed you can see four of the runways there uh back yeah um you can see you can actually see four of the runways there were actually five there's an additional runway in there somewhere and you can see the ship the hangars and so forth that was the airport above that you can see the channel of the cooks river flowing from right on your bay south you can see the uh the um uh tower point uh uh wetlands to the south of that and looking looking looking south towards granola and on your right brighton now um so that's what it looked like in 1939 the foreground you can also see that there's an awful lot of market goals when I started doing research in this talk this one thing that struck me the very recency of the presence of extensive agriculture in the cooks river valley and the huge importance of it for the economy of the city in the supply of vegetables so we go on to the next one we'll also see another image from from about the same time 1937 that was with the opening of the then new bridge over over alexandra canal which has been canalized out of the old shae's creek uh in the 1890s and the original bridge is the drawbridge which you can see there a little little drawbridge before it had been taken down and that's a rather rare photograph of that um and the new bridge of one of the drawbridge is gone the other bridge is still there but there's another bridge to the uh to the upper upper up further which is where the uh west connects and all the new roadworks have gone in there but if you look again you'll see a lot of in the middle section you'll see a lot of market gardens in the rosebury gardens road in that area there okay let's go on to the next one now the next one is significant because it's almost the same area not quite it shows extensive industrialization um and it's just a little bit upstream and there's an awful lot of there there are there is um oil uh oil um reserves at the bottom and then there are also all kinds of manufacturing uh plants up the river a lot of this went in in the 1930s and 1940s particularly in the 1940s world war ii industrial and industrialization more generally the alexander canal became a place of large-scale industrialization and it caused huge pollution heavy metal damage in the river which on in the late 1930s and 1940s as a result of world war ii industrialization next slide please now the other big change to the lower river which follows from all these things is the airport in the 1930s there really wasn't a there really wasn't much of an airport as you can see from a previous illustration and this one in 1930 1947 shows you the existence of four of the runways uh there um and um there are one two three well actually there are only four runways I must have miscounted before I thought there was five in that but there's only four okay so you can see where the old airport is and you can see the course of the river down below there below the uh yeah that's right um if we go back to the left you can see muddy creek as well and you can also see crossing muddy creek if you go uh back there yeah that's actually the sewer pipes which come across there it's important to point this out because I'm not sure that um that went out to the uh um malabar uh ocean out for okay you can see in the left hand top side you can see all the all the dredging that's been done to the river and what a geometric uh kind of appearance and quite quite a still appearance because you can just see the bridge there and uh a line across the canal there yeah that's right and um that's where the dam was right there yeah okay um okay so that's still stayed in 1947 let's go on to the next one because we are running out of time and then you can see it in 1953. and the the the direction of the airport has been completely changed to make the east west runway the main main runway and the uh entrance to the river has been completely changed um down down to caima so the river has been shortened and if we go on to the next one we shall see next what it looks like today okay that's just to put you in uh reoriented people can see the um outcrooks room but you can also see the muddy creek to to the uh yeah that's it from muddy creek right there and upstream if we go to the right you can see um the uh a little bit upstream further and I think that is yeah that's where the dam was there and that's where the princess highway uh connection is okay next one please we're just about out I'm just about finished okay west botany uh is what it looked like in 1886 and in the middle of that you can see the swamp and you can see the muddy creek uh et cetera et cetera in the uh upper part of yours yeah there right about there south of there yeah that's right right about there and okay next one we see what it looked like in 19 we can see the next we will okay canalization had occurred there by the mid 93s you can see muddy creek again which has been turned into a kind of boat boat harbour and above that you can see over the over the muddy creek but the river was still the same that's 1937 93 mid 1930s and muddy creek was canalised next one next one please okay and that's what it looks like more or less today and of course there's that's not the entrance of that is the entrance to the cooks river now and the muddy creek ends right there right at that point here okay now think that's probably the last slide that I wanted to show you go on to the next one oh no connecting the local and go well that's something I do in this book the concrete or after 1938 and what I call engineering modernism here it is in uh in the upper cook river valley I see the slot in the middle and the completely canalized course of the river go on to the next one los angeles river and los angeles river has exactly the same thing and it was also done at exactly the same time so in the book I explain how this is a sort of transnational or international transformed in the 20th century and the cook there are some enormous parallels between the los angeles river and the crookshare after 1938 also in the rectification of the damage time which is going on still today um let's go on beyond that to the next one uh just skip that one yeah skip that one that's just another engineering modernist okay now behind this was the idea of improvement um and the culture of a valley improvement league 1900 made in reformed land 24 and then the cook river valley association revegetation since the 1980s an ecological uh restoration of themes that come out in my book which I can't talk about here today but just not we just don't have enough time so if we go on to the next one I'm not sure is there one more should be okay now this comes from six maps to a very useful site which I can like I can answer questions about but it's very useful because it shows you where things were at in 1943 and on that map you can see the concreting actually ended up there in the left-hand corner uh not quite there there yeah right there and if you look north a little bit up from that you can see where the natural stream is and if you look downstream a bit you can see that they've changed downstream as well uh the course of it go up from that you'll see where the original course yeah that's the original course if you follow that curve around that was the original course you see so you can see the way they um they concreted it okay now if you go the uh big hole in the top left hand corner is what's now called dean reserve um the dean reserve which was a brick pit in the night in the 1930s uh the brick pits up and down the valley okay so six maps are just a very useful site for trying to check out what these things were like in 1943 and you'll notice there's not very much vegetation the vegetation excuse me vegetation has come subsequent to this it's put it that way since that time I think we might stop there that really oh that really gives you a pretty good idea of what's uh the main changes that have gone on okay thank you very much
Two decades of experience um working in newspapers um he's the author of about nine books on subjects such as beer and the band's midnight oil and tumbleweed today he's going to talk to us about his 2019 book night terrors the true story of the kingsgrove slasher thank you glenn and over to you yep I guess I'll tackle the one thing straight off uh why a guy from who lives in wollongong and works for illawarra mercury his writing has written a book about the king's rose slasher it's because I grew up in kingsgrove myself in the same house that my dad lived in actually during the three years that the slasher was doing his business uh he was there with two older sister a twin sister and an older sister so they were obviously quite frightened at the time um but fortunately for them they were the house was a fair way outside his normal hunting ground which was around that girawain park walla creek area so they never got a visit thankful thankfully to all of us um and slideshow um just let you know there's a spoiler alert right at the start um in the that first shot we'll see is of the slasher himself that's david scanlan I don't know I'm assuming everyone can see that if I get yep yep cool it's me at my first go with zoom um that's david scanlon um born in 1929 um his parents had several three kids in a short space of time before him and there was like eight or nine year gap which sort of suggests that he might have been an accident rather than anything that was planned uh the family reports say he was a a quiet child a fragile child who might not have survived past toddlerhood but he did um and the later reports him growing up so he was highly strung um he moved around a bit with his family because his father was working the railroads at the time until about his teens when he moved the family moved to kingsgrove where they stayed in new england drive which is just I think it was there and I think one of the things that may well have led him onto the path of what he did happened in 1951 when his mother dies um he comes home from work walks into the kitchen and effectively trips over her body in the kitchen and the family reports from the court documents state that he um he's personally changed from that time he came quite withdrawn and where he wouldn't talk to people very often um and there was a gap between the first crime we get as the slasher is 1956 and this death it was in 1951 um and it he sort of built up in effect first his first starts by um just climbing into people's backyards and looking in through windows just being a peeping tom and over time that escalates to you know I guess not getting the same thrill out of that so he climbs into people's houses watches them sleep uh there's claims that he would sit on the chair in the lounge room and watch them as they got up to go to then again over time that no longer became enough and he decided to I guess start doing what he got his name for what which was slashing more so bedding and sheets than actual people though they got cut a few times as well first one was actually not the only one that wasn't in a house that was margaret campbell who was parked in a car with a boyfriend uh along the train line near beverly hills this is obviously back when it was bushland and it was quite secluded they had the doors open uh to let the air in because it was a hot night took to taken the the light out of the interior light out so there was no light there he snuck up um cut her across the chest a few times with a razor um she didn't feel anything it seems until he actually had went off and watched him to see her reaction and got none so he just left uh but she had to go to hospital and get some stitches put in um and then that was march stores who's just a 12 year old um in july four he just climbed into her bed bedroom and basically um just cut a few bed sheets and left so they didn't really they she woke up and thought it was his um her she thought it was her sister sorry she thought it was her brother who'd woken up and was trying to scare her until she realized what was going on uh and then july 14 uh was leslie jean coleman who was probably the most violent of the attacks um she'd gone out with a with a boyfriend and they'd come home the mom had left the door unlocked so they could get in they caught in uh and then the sun didn't lock the door properly when they went to bed so the slasher was out prowling that night and found the door open walked in uh looks like he cut a few bits of bedding on other people's beds in the house and then when he came into leslie coleman's room she actually said he punched her and knocked her into unconsciousness and she would have choked on the own blood if the parents hadn't got there in time uh and then next one which is even worse is uh a seven-year-old um ann willis who just he cuts through the bedding um and there's some like little grazers um upon upon the girl's body and since writing the book she would probably be the only pers victim who's still alive and after writing the book she's actually contacted me and was pleased to find out the book had been written and she found out the full story and has been able to share it with a family to actually so they've got a better understanding of what she went through as a child and the funny thing even with the media the media attention later on got quite strong with the slasher but these early cases I could not find any news clippings at all about um any of the crimes and as I know as journalists these are the sort of things I would have thought would have made _''_404.0 first one was actually the fifth crime um gloria gayson who basically had a pajamas slashed but there was no pass to her and we can see these are the sort of headlines that we get where he's being called a sex maniac or a sex pervert and the like uh and she was in armatry street kingsgrove as you can see from those headlines the headlines there that's more sex slasher hunt for sex fiend these are all tabloid headlines because they suddenly realized that this was a story that was going to sell them papers that people were going to want to start reading and often down the line as you'll see it makes front page of a lot of the papers and in the trial coverage they devoted three or four full pages every day to the court covering um we got another even this case we don't know if it was actually the slasher because the problem throughout the case again you get a whole lot of people saying they were visited by the slasher but the slasher never when they got of the others sort of just sound a bit fishy like they've been actually been made up um this is an interesting one this is uh number seven judith gurney or annette gurney and at judith gurney it's interesting because the slasher said he didn't follow any of these women home didn't know them there was just it was just by choice random chance that he was in their homes this is interesting because the gurney's lived five doors down from where him and his parents lived so I just sort of think there's no way possible he couldn't have not known her he must have seen her in the street must have walked past her at some stage and it has another wrinkle that annette is the first person uh who actually sees the slasher up until this point no one had caught eye had eyes on him or seen him or could ever give any sort of description but annette was able to give us a description but somehow she didn't recognize him as the guy who lived five hours she did whether things would have stopped when they did and some more coverage there that's there's annette gurney herself they they ran a photo she's they ran photos of a lot of the victims throughout the pages of the paper at the time which is a journalist I can tell you we certainly wouldn't be able to do today especially with the the one the under 10s and the under 18s the miners you wouldn't be able to do that and very early on we get the vigilantes coming out these are uh arthur and rex jackson who brothers who live in the same house with their wives um deciding to pose for the paper holding the guns that they intend on shooting at the slasher if he ever comes around their place but he did not and we got the eighth attack which is valerie june thompson um she got she woke up in the bed she was in bed with her husband wakes up and sees the man standing over a bed having just slashed her and cut her arm uh the and chases him down out into the backyard but he jumps the fence and gets away that's telling because he slasher always said he did this because he'd like to be chased um and yet this is the only time in his or all the 18 crimes he ever actually gets chased by anyone all the other times he's basically out of the room or gone sometimes he's even they don't even know he's in the room and he's left and they're woken up the next day and found something's happened so I think the idea that he was doing it so people would track him down and pursue him just doesn't make sense but now we got um this is rosalie meyer not case nine um as you see the headline pretty girl bashed uh it's a bit of an unnerving way they cover things with the teenage victims they often refer to them as pretty or attractive um vivacious it just seems like a really now given it's effectively a sexually related crime and these are to way to be describing these people these girls these victims uh she's in undercliff um and she he came into her room with a block of wood and basically hit her in the face and hit her in the head and she had to get stitches above her brow up above here she was unconscious and I guess for some time thereafter was sort of really unsettled and couldn't be left alone by the family because she was that worried about uh what had happened and around this time I should say he uh the slasher david scalen gets married which had surprised a lot of psychiatrists who were trying to work out who this person would have been this slasher and they all had was saying that he would be anti-social wouldn't be able to have any relationships with women would keep to himself but they were largely wrong because he marries a woman named doreen and for a while they're still living in um excuse me still living in the area but they moved to lavender bay on the north just on the bay these last few crimes we've seen are actually still committed in the the kingsgrove area because it seems either he's come back to his old stomping ground or he's been staying overnight maybe visiting the family and he stayed overnight and taken the chance to go out in the wee small hours around his old storm stomping ground the first this is the first one that he commits near his own house this is in um this is in lavender bay it's about two blocks from where he was staying at a share house with his wife uh that's georgina palmer it's a 14 year old again would never put a today you'd never put the front page of a teenage victim of an assault on the front page of the paper like that she was basically just cut into clothes her clothes will cut and just some blood was drawn when he climbed up a ladder around the back of these flats she was living in reached in and used a razor I should say it was uh the old safety just a razor blade that he often would get um from his wife actually because the slasher himself used an electric razor so he didn't actually have blades for himself um and often again something else about the coverage is they would give the people's the victims full name a street and the suburb so it was effectively if you really wanted to it was quite easy to go to these victims houses and find them and talk to them and that's exactly what happened with georgina palmer that the next day as you can see there he this man turned up to the house said he was a policeman and started quizzing the mum and georgina about what had happened and the mother got quite suspicious about it rang the cops and found out that he wasn't a policeman at all and then he ends up gets charged with impersonating a policeman and has to appear in court himself so georgina is number 10 on the list and we have um 11 with lauren cousins sorry laura yeah lorraine cousins in walker street torella who taken off you know got changed taken off her swimsuit wrapped it up in a towel and put it on the ground at the end of the bed the next morning she wakes up and finds it's been unravelled and the the cost swimming costume has been slashed to pieces and things have been moved around a room um she had no he was obviously in the room she had no knowledge that he was there until the next morning um and so she wasn't as put out as some of the other victims I think she actually went to work the next day not really that concerned and the strange thing we get here is this was december 19 1956 was the cousin's case the next one wasn't until march 18 1958 uh I did elementary mass I counted him and this is 450 days between crimes um it's never really been explained what was going on there um other than scanlan himself saying he tried to stop for his wife's sake uh whether that's the truth or not I don't get away and do it for so long but it did lead to that long gap led to the police wondering what had happened to him maybe he had been in a maybe the slasher had been in a psychiatric ward in hospital had gone overseas there was one also one report that this was the slasher this was a person who um not long after the 11th crime was found um hanging over his clothes line in the backyard wearing a women's bra stockings and shoes and so they figured well he passed he died and the crimes had stopped so maybe he's the reason for it but obviously as it turned out it wasn't because we got another crime 1958 uh sorry march 1958 uh robin williams uh was attacked she's in um one in greendale road greenwich northern suburbs of sydney um this is where he starts the violence and the sexual motive start mixing up a bit because he not only does he punch her in the face and gropes her he also puts his hands around her neck and there's her unconscious or do something worse um september 1958 he moves to arncliff back into the stomping ground and november he cuts uh uh 63 year old margaret austin uh this is probably the deepest cut it's like a 10 12 inch cut along the um the abdomen she actually had to get rushed to hospital to um get stitches put in um the unfortunate thing for her is she was actually living with her son and daughter-in-law at the time which actually sort of put her closer to the house and her own place would have been so if she hadn't been there there's every chance she might not have been attacked at all and at this stage and everyone now realized the slasher's back so the police who had copped a bit of a hiding for not being able to find him the first time around actually get get serious and cib detective doyle brian doyle starts and he was starts to slash a squad which slash of a trial which ends up patrolling heroine park area um some have to pretend to be woods in the commandos hiding in the mud to try and work out where he is uh and here's some examples of while they're trying to work out um who the slasher is we've got the public getting quite distressed about what's going on this is uh there was this great instance in december into brett street where there was a huge crowd of people ran out into the streets trying to find them find the man um with guns and knives and whatnot again more headlines about the the fear that he is installed into the community um and because there's more incidents from to brett street these are two women who claim they were attacked by the slasher um the woman on the left probably didn't given that uh if she used to believe the slashes must have spent an hour cutting every piece of material in her bedroom while she sat in the bed doing nothing um what yep and there's another case of the the strangeness in december 1958 it seems to really hit a high point in uh what's going on to the extent that we get more more cases of people who think they've been seen by the slasher but it's unlikely to be certainly wasn't claimed by the slasher another more cases vigilante groups walking the street looking for young men who were out and about after hours pretty much at that time any man who was walking home from the pub or going for a run or what have you would have gotten pulled over by the police and asked a question or two again parents decide to protect their daughters and go out looking for him the slasher every night so much so that a guy a canadian who got off of the wrong train and didn't know where he was 1am went knocking on doors in birong and basically scared the light the daylights out of everybody there had to call they called the cops thinking they'd actually had the slasher banging on their doors and I'll skip through the last two so we can get some question times in and I'm 17 victim with a razor and slashed her bedding that's a file footage that's her house and you can see in the background that's the window there background is the train line which runs across there in warlow creeks in the background and that is now a road that section there and the bushland on the other side to the left of the picture is now a business so what he would do generally is run across that train line back into the bush cut across come out the other side where the how where other houses were uh you know prowl around a bit more than if he was spotted he'd duck back into the bush again to hide we've got the 18th and the final case which is helen gaffey where he broke into the house um took a whole lot of clothes outside spent some time in the backyards tearing him to pieces throwing him around the yard and then went back in and cut her and like several other previous victims that I haven't mentioned they also they were also groped so violence motive of violence um and we got see several pages of coverage about the gaffy murder there's another claim of someone else a woman saying that the slasher had attacked her but it seems that she only attacked she only got attacked when no one else seemed to be in the house um and the police was quite suspicious that the dog was her dog was in the house in the house one instance and was outside in the backyard and another and she never barked the dog never barked so they were quite um dubious that there was actually anyone else in the house at the time that it because they do um tend to some of them seem to drawing attention to themselves or they're unbalanced and just decided to do these sort of things here's another one she claimed the slasher attacked it with the in the face with a wire brush but to me those cuts look very very superficial like someone had maybe done it to themselves rather than someone being held down and being attacked with a brush and this're going to catch him they'd worked out the plant uh detective doyle had worked out a plan that he was using the girowain park area walleye creek cutting through as I said earlier from one houses on one side to house on the southern side and using the um the bushland as an escape route so they had positions um policemen in the bush and at either end of it so when when this happened they basically called the alarm and said he's coming and so they were patrolling the area around torella station and they found him and then he ducked back into the bush but they couldn't find him anymore so they but the thing is they knew their plan was working they knew what his modus operandi was what he was trying to do and unless he stopped it was only going to be a matter of time really before he got caught um and that's pretty much what it was um sad irony is that they decided to put out a 1 000 reward after the last crime rather than doing will unknowingly have waited until his almost basically about to get caught before they actually decide to put out a monetary reward this is the second escape where sexes are not a second attempt where he got away from police who thought that was him that was the slasher and they were actually right they got very close uh this is a woman who was trying to claim it's freda grafton she tried to claim the reward uh that one thousand dollar reward saying that her call was instrumental in the slashes later capture as we'll see but the the police chief decided no the police were already around in the area they would have got him anyway so she missed out on the thousand pound reward now here we got three um cases of the three reports of the arrest now this is from the sydney morning herald who was on hiding to nothing because their because their deadlines would be at three or four in the morning they couldn't do it anything but the most basic information about the chase about the capture say reading but they're not able to say that the sun probably should have said it but they didn't say it either for some reason they just had to they've apparently tried to hedge their bets and say it wasn't but it's obviously that the mirror knew a lot of people in in the police and could actually get not only this true story that the had identified himself as the slasher when he was arrested but they were also able to get a photographer out to kingsgrove police station to see brian doyle bringing the slasher into custody um and he's blacked out because uh identity would be an issue at this stage and they don't want to obviously prejudice at trial or anything by showing a photo of him before he's actually found guilty uh he had a committal hearing which is a three-day hearing to try and work out what the charges whether there would be any charges or would go to trial and as we can see this is just from one ish one day of the mirror second page on the coverage just it's just page after page for the whole three days and here again in terms of the underage victims they would publish their names ages address street name street number street name and suburb and photos so you could literally walk into up to their house knock on the door and talk to them um which is a very straight it's just very as a journalist today it's very strange because as I said you just wouldn't do that today you'd have they'd be protected and certainly as a minor you would never ever use be able to use their names in media coverage this is the actual transcripts from the the committal hearing they were sealed by um the the court at the time for 75 years so I'd actually had to petition the court to release them so I could actually have a look at them that's uh margaret collins testimony that's elaine erdley who was aunt of one of the victims staying in the same room she was the only person who actually hit him in the face with her shoe high-heeled shoe that she had she's the only person who actually attacked the slasher back uh that is in reference to statements from the slasher himself about what he was doing and there's the origins of well what he says is the origins of why did he like to be chased which is pretty much a falsehood whether he knows it or not I don't know uh this is a section that I found interesting because I used it on the back of the book um he's asked to estimate how many houses and backyards he would have been in since he's been doing this and he answers no it would be terribly hard to say uh would it be hundreds or would it be thousands many hundreds perhaps thousands so that's if you think about it if you're living in there at the time and someone in your street had the slasher in their house chances are pretty high that he was in your house before then as well because he wouldn't just go day he'd be prowling for hours and going into plenty of houses and backyards all the all the while uh we've got some fingerprints and palm prints that were taken from various houses that we used as evidence and they were able to confirm that scanlon's fingerprints matched if this is the trial before they actually have the trial he pleads guilty which means it's effectively just sentencing now they've got to work out how long to jail him for so he's guilty and he's been given 18 years uh in jail to which he apparently said to the guys in the jail when he went out it was a bit hot meaning he thought it was a bit too much excuse me a bit much to be giving that sort of sentence and that is his gravestone um as you can see born 1929 died in 1995 that's at richmond um in conclusion like until he sort of was fairly quiet afterwards he was paroled in 1970 um from what I can gather from actually a woman who was his daughter sister-in-law in sydney for a while then moved to the north coast the central coast rather where he met a woman who'd already had several children they married had another children who was another child who was the woman I spoke to worked in this deal works up there um as far as I know never committed another crime and ultimately yeah he passed away in 1995 and that should be it was looking at the time went a bit over so but we got there in the end yeah I didn't realize quite how much there was until I had to go and speak through it all so I'm happy to have any questions now thank you glenn that's I mean it's just fascinating I think that you bring a journalist's knowledge and sensibility to that story which is told through predominantly through accounts in the newspapers and then of course it was great that you had access to the court transcripts um there is one question that I saw come up in the chat and that's from sandra asking at what slasher it sounds like it was quite towards the end of their chase uh when they arrested him is the truth they had he was a clean skin so he committed no crimes he had no criminal record um so really they they had fingerprints but obviously fingerprints if you if you've never been fingerprinted your fingerprints aren't on file so fingerprints on that case they're only good once you've actually got someone in this in custody so you can actually compare the fingerprints too and when he was arrested at uh crossing the bridge to uh torella station he got caught and he asked to speak to detective doyle and he went yep I'm I'm your man I'm the slasher and that's when they knew who the slasher was that's making me curious to read your book because there's so many psychological questions that you've raised today I think you know why was he ready to give himself up and why did other women want to be seen to be victims of the slasher as well but I because we've got a question from julie who's asking was his wife ever suspicious his first wife um you would think so but it doesn't seem to be the case um she's never I never there might be some interviews with her in police files which I didn't have access to uh they talk about he was a runner and a fitness freak so he would sometimes say he was going out for a run late at night um and she was apparently a heavy sleeper so wouldn't hear him when he came in um which I don't know I i sort of think you know I'm married and you know I at some stage you wake up and you see there's no one in the bed next to you you sort of think that's a bit strange um later on when they moved to arncliff he would say he was working late uh and then he would get off the torilla and go into the bush and change into his prowling gear and and he took he took that his pay packet over to his wife he would make sure there was some extra money in there to cover this alleged overtime that he told his wife he was doing so it really seems that she even got him to put they called slasher bars which are those iron bars placed on the windows of people's houses to stop basically stop someone from getting in um his wife actually got him to put slasher bars on the windows of their own house because she was afraid of uh the slasher getting in because she didn't actually realize he already had wow ironic isn't it yes and she certainly actually as not surprisingly she served him divorce papers while he was in jail right I was going to be on the grounds of desertion it couldn't actually be it was back in the day you had to have a socially acceptable reason to divorce someone you couldn't just go you're a criminal I'm going yes at a legally acceptable reason to divorce someone too yes so tony says thank you very interesting and terrifying story um janet is asking how did you find out about the story of the kingsgrove slasher and I think you briefly talked about that at the very beginning um glenn yeah yeah I um I grew up in kingsgrove um and I remember hearing ex very exaggerated stories from my cousin about uh what had happened you know he would talk about women were walking around the streets carrying knives and swords to protect themselves it wasn't you know just was a slight exaggeration but and you'd hear this I guess these urban myths sort of come around and I would never see anything about him in crime through crime anthologies it just sort of seemed to slip through the cracks and so it was only a couple of years about a year or so before I decided to write the book I just thought well I actually just want to know what happened how bad was it was it was it all overstated as some people have seemed to think so I just started um you know going on the you know the great online a few hours at the state library going through the sun and the telegraph and the hair and the the mirror which were the main sources of coverage and then you just sort of find out a lot of stuff that probably hadn't seen the light of day since the 50s because people think he was just a a minor criminal who just cut a few bed sheets yeah and I just want to recognize the um research that you would have had to do because trove generally cuts out around 1955 because of copyright laws and most of your newspaper sources were from 1956 when the slasher commences yes exactly a year or two after the copyright yeah exactly so a lot of hours of microfilm there I i can empathize yeah I sort of when I write books I don't write them to I guess make money or write them because I figured this book needs to exist you know it needs to fill a niche in the bookshelf somewhere of history um so it's just if I'm if I'm enjoying writing it and go through microfilm for hours just got to make sure you don't get distracted by looking at the 1950s ads and exactly um susan's got a question and this might have to be the last one because we are over time what was the psychiatric assessment of him while he was in jail was there one done um there was several done um both by the defense and by the the prosecution in terms of the sentencing defense effectively believe the idea that he wanted to be chased um they said it was not a literal chase they all like you'd like the idea of you know the police were narrowing in home closing in on him the media was closing in on him um that sort of thing but the slasher himself actually said he hated that because it actually made him heart made it harder for him to do the job so I just tend to think if he was interested in the chase then he probably would have enjoyed the attention but he hated it um I think the other the the police that there was a sexual motive in it um for sure um so much so that and it was so deep seated that even scanlan probably wasn't aware of it himself um so he would and that sort of makes sense to me it just seems the the the pattern of escalation seemed to be odd that the early ones with the violent ones and it's not until he comes back that there's more groping and more of a sexual thing going on it becomes more of a sexual assault so I think the later ones there's ones where he's letting he's come to terms with what he wants and why he's doing it so he's able to let free reign go and do what he wants and I think it's probably good that he got caught because I think it would have escalated even further if it had of um gone on yes we're we're all I can speaking as a woman that lives alone we're all very very glad that he's been caught um and in our streets and neighborhood um groups today to help us feel safer as well yeah and I think if this happened today it would be the same level of coverage that it was in the 50s it certainly would be front page of papers it'd be outraged there'd be fear it would have happened all over again it wasn't a reaction that's exclusive to those times that's right well thank you so much glenn on behalf of everybody there's been some other comments in the chat there saying thank you to you for a very interesting talk glenn's book is available via his website lastdayofschool.net I also would like to recommend next friday's talk which will be um uh by by janet pelosi and it will be about um firefighters volunteer firefighters um from the bayside area um first of all starting with the rockdale volunteer fire brigade and then other volunteer fire brigades so people that help us feel safe as a counterpoint to to glenn's story today and we have as I said other um lunch and learn put the the link for our eventbrite site in the chat so thank you everybody for joining us today um hope you can get outside and enjoy the sunshine this afternoon in um our lockdown situation have a lovely weekend everybody bye for now thanks glenn no worries
Okay thank you so much kelsey I really appreciate uh being invited to bayside community the lunch and learn I'm warwick and I work for opportunity international and opportunity works to empower families so they can lift themselves uh out of poverty let me just make sure this is now working okay uh one in four people live on less than 3.20 a day but for our clients living in poverty is much more than just a lack of money it's poverty is a lack of real choices a lack of choices limits their ability to make decisions and create a pathway out of poverty and so opportunity international work with communities in poverty to help and increase their choices and to build that pathway out of poverty it's estimated that because of covert uh there's 119 million people pushed back into poverty by the end of this year and to give you an idea of how many is 119 million people that's all the people in australia five times over so the need to tackle poverty has never been more urgent than it is for those of you who don't know microfinance is giving women small loans to start and grow businesses their businesses are sustainable and we have about a 98 repayment rate and we work with local partners and we do that because those partners understand the culture and they've got long-standing relationships within their communities and so that builds trust we work with a number of countries but india and indonesia are our main focus in microfinance a dollar donated is leveraged two up to four times so a donation of a hundred dollars is leveraged to maybe two hundred dollars or four hundred dollars which is then lent out to women ninety-five percent of our clients are women uh so there are few men but it's primarily women and we work with women because it appears that for every one dollar profit that they make they spend 80 cents on that on their children on their education on their health better living conditions I guess this isn't surprising I mean women and mothers everywhere you know really focus on children and it's shown here the is the the reason we work with women is women are just better repairs microfinance is a hand up and it's not a handout it's sustainable and once the business has started it generates income that continues as I mentioned earlier historically our repayment rate is 98 during covert of course that are all changed but it's surprising how resilient uh people are and uh they're repaying and getting back to business and this repayment rate shows that businesses are profitable and that profit that extra income is helping to lift families out of poverty the whole cycle is repeated when the loan is repaid and typically a loan is about nine months so every loan uh nine months another loan goes out so another woman is given a small loan she starts or grows her business that generates that sustainable income and the children and the community benefit I'd like to show you a a short video uh about uh amina let's hope that this works wait a second here are you looking to invest in your first or your next ipo but the time so let me go to this one and click this button and here we go my name is amina and my story is one of hope as a child I remember the holes in the roof dripping water during the rain and waiting to see if my father a tricycle driver would come home with rice for dinner after harvest time my parents used to pick up scraps and leftovers just to ensure we could eat when I was in school I remember sewing together blank pages from old notebooks because we couldn't afford school supplies our special christmas lunch was a bowl of porridge as a family we had to survive on four dollars a day no matter how hard my family worked we seemed to be trapped in a cycle of poverty but then we discovered about the small loans available from opportunity international australia mom had an idea to start a piggery business so we took out a loan for 123 dollars from one of opportunities microfinance partners this was enough to buy free pigs and begin providing a better future for me and never have been possible without this opportunity opportunity helps families in poverty grow small businesses earn regular incomes and improve their access to life-changing healthcare and education they enable people uncertain of how they will survive to have dreams and a future like me but across the world the kovit 19 pandemic has devastated millions of families in vulnerable communities every day they wake up to poverty sickness and hunger imagine facing this pandemic in islam where social distancing is virtually impossible water is contaminated and soap is a luxury then imagine being locked down unable to run the business that enables you to feed your family if schools have been closed and when they reopen many children won't be able to come back they either have to work to put food on the table or their families simply cannot afford it just like with a natural disaster or war it's what happens in the aftermath that dictates the future with this pandemic that time begins now with a small loan families can rebuild the businesses that have been devastated by covet 19. a small they can build a better life for their families a small loan helped my mother break the cycle of poverty in our family it enabled us to think about life beyond our next meal to get an education to see a path into the future the dreams I had as a child became reality I was able to finish a school get a scholarship and go to an american university I can pay it forward and create the same opportunities I had for other families in need breaking the poverty cycle does so much more than fix a leaky roof not only is my parents house now renovated but my sister is now a preschool teacher doing a phd without my mom's courage combined with a small lawn my family's life could have been very different I am a living proof of what's possible with an opportunity provided by someone like you and in the aftermath of golden 19 families in poverty need our help now more than ever together we can make an impact but there is no way without you to make a real so that's uh amina's um a story and uh it's uh of course a one of the great stories but there are um millions of stories you know like uh amina let me just uh get back to our presentation okay there we go okay so I've mentioned that microfinance is our core work and that's primarily a mina's story that her mother borrowed had a small loan bought those three pigs and started a business through that so it's providing small loans and financial services and of course training people how to run a business and to manage their money and we established that through local microfinance companies uh but we also work in health and training local women to become health leaders it's a grassroots community based program and we work in education uh making education accessible through through loans and we work in women's safety helping communities to detect and eliminate threats of safety particularly domestic violence and child trafficking I'd like to tell you a story about um debbie one of our community health leaders in 2006 she started a small business by taking out a small microfinance loan just like amina's mum did and in 2010 she was encouraged to participate in what we call our health leadership program in that program debbie studied for six months and did a six-month internship and so she now educates the community about hygiene basic aid and how and who to contact for more advanced health services she also now continues to deliver critical health education to the 150 households in her community she couples this education with her small business which is selling recyclable sanitary pads and other health and hygiene products I wanted to give you a bit more information about uh covert no I wonder yeah let's move that down there and what we've specifically done during covert and as amina said covert has devastated communities one of the things we did was to prevent infection in vulnerable populations one of the key things was that there was a rampant misinformation and so we used sms whatsapp comics posters voice messages and in personal meetings to disseminate the real facts let's okay here we go uh for those um with milder simpson symptoms or exposure to covert we distributed food ration kits sanitary kits medicine and as you saw in that picture in india with all that hustle and bustle in the developing world space is a premium and so it's difficult to isolate and so we provided particularly in rural villages isolation centers to manage covert and the mental health issues at home we provided remote care through telemedicine via a helpline mobile app and clinics and I just want to explain you know I'm talking about uh sms and telemedicine so using mobile technology and when I started working development and my previous canadi career about 25 years was in the financial markets and when I left the markets I moved to india and then cambodia and I traveled in a lot of developing countries and one of the things I was really surprised about was how many poor people had mobile phones and what it turns out is mobile phones are very cheap there's cheap chinese mobile phones they're affordable even for very cheap and so mobile phones are everywhere and what this means is that most people even the poor have a mobile phone and that's why something like telemedicine works really well and it's really efficient because we can get to people in remote communities and it's an inexpensive way of doing it rather than you know someone jumping on a motorbike and riding out to these communities if we can do it digitally for people who had uh worsening coveted symptoms and we're not a health organization but we do have all these branch offices of these microfinance institutions all over the country and so we use those branch offices and the facilities to set up some basic care and oxygen but always you know sending people to a hospital if they needed it to expediate the mass vaccinations and which is improving immunity we collaborated with local governments and organized uh vaccination camps and because of our trust uh in those communities this really helped uh mobilize and get many people vaccinated so what's the way forward now that uh you know vaccinations more immunity one of the things with microfinance is providing capital for restarting those businesses and the loans have been redesigned to meet the specific needs of clients as they emerged out of the pandemic some of them you know if they've got a small business they've consumed all their stock and so they've got nothing to sell so we need to kick-start them with that loan so they can buy stock and start selling again and the pandemic has highlighted the advantage of using our technology call centers and digital finance infrastructure and because of that widespread mobile phone distribution that makes it all possible we also work in stopping human trafficking particularly our child trafficking and as you can see the statistics on traffic trafficking are frightening unfortunately the coronavirus uh has worsened the situation uh targeted villagers are more vulnerable children are out of school and people are jobless and incomes have been decimated and traffickers exploit that poverty and the mindsets that undervalue girls because only one percent of children are ever rescued from being trafficked we focus on prevention and we do people understand what uh the traffickers are really doing because they're tricked into thinking that their daughters are going to a better job or married to you know a caring and person that is going to look after and provide income they're tricked into it but once they understand that's what's not happening then no parent wants to see their daughter end up you know being trafficked and so we go into those villages and by setting up village custodians and educating them we have these custodians who watched um the community and know who to contact in the authorities when they see potential risks and just to give you an idea of the sort of the impact that we've had we've built a volunteer base over a couple of years of about 4 000 people we've trained in over 4 600 villages so basically about one person in each villages is changed uh trained as this volunteer and we've distributed 1.2 million local language uh books and comics because we also want to get to children comics is a way that to communicate and we've educated around about 2.5 million people so thank you so much for listening how opportunity international are working with generous donors here in australia so we can implement this work that I've spoken to you about so I'll hand back over to you kelsey
Hi welcome and thank you for joining us for today's lunch and learn session fascinating pollination facts from around the world with dr francisco garcia I'm carly I'm your host for today um but before we begin I would like to acknowledge um the traditional custodians of the land on which I am working today the gadigal and vidigal people of the urination the people of the euro nation their spirits and ancestors will always remain with our waterways and the land our mother earth I would also like to pay my respects to elders past present and emerging um so as I said we before we begin we we will be answering questions but it will be at the end of the presentation so you can either add your questions to the chat or unmute yourself at the end to ask francisco yourself now uh it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to dr francisco um would you mind just telling us a little bit about yourself and how you became so knowledgeable on the topic of pollination yeah of course I'm originally bees and bumblebees and sting with this and I started reading a lot of books about social insects and I find fascinating the way they cooperate with each other for the well-being of the colony and my interest dragged me to beast but then I discovered all this amazing world of pollinators and I was very surprised to know that other things can pollinate too such as reptiles or lemurs or really cool things that we're going to learn today in the talk and it's not just how fascinating they are but how important this relationship is for us humans for the fruits that we eat but for plants in general just ecosystems it's just a vital relationship for the well-being of ecosystems in general pollination allows other plants to reproduce and to have fruits and these fruits will develop seeds and then these seeds will create a whole new plant later on so pollination is just the basis for all these very important relationships that sounds so interesting I can't wait to see a presentation are you ready to go yeah I'm ready to me share my screen here we go can you see it yes great okay so I decided to title it the good the bad and the ugly why because pollination comes in all shapes and around in nature it's just very interesting this relationship we're talking about thousands of plants out there and each plant has their own characteristics and their own they have a ball to attract different things in this case pollinators right what what's a pollination syndrome that's how is the plant being fertilized by whom so certain plants will have bee pollination syndromes and certain other plants will have lemur pollination syndrome so it depends what pollination they want to attract then this syndrome will be changing throughout the ecosystem for the plants so that's me I already introduced myself I came originally from mexico and I did my phd at the university of sydney working with stinglessbees and I loved it it was a great phd I really enjoyed working with the bees I did a lot of field work that's me not in us in australia but in little bit and then in the philippines we met local beekeepers and we were doing some local management which was great I always tried to learn from people all around the world and to learn more about the techniques that they are using in order to take care of the bees great so I'd like to put this as a quick intro do you like these products and I'm basing this in australia so I know that I personally didn't like coffee before I came to australia and now I'm the biggest fan I cannot start my morning without a good coffee macadamia nuts of course that's another quite australian big pride of product and then mangoes pineapples coconuts so all these things are pollinated which is very important to know if we if it was not because of pollinators we would not have these amazing things so our lives would change dramatically right we will not die but it would be quite boring not to have coffee or macadamia nuts or just a whole array of fruits that are out there so these things to link what we drink what we during the day it might be linked to pollination not just the bees but other kinds of things that are pollinating out there and we will learn that today throughout the presentation so quickly what are we learning today I wanna do divide this talk in two parts one the introduction part which is the talking about the flowers and what is pollination in general and then I want to talk about some of the coolest syndromes out there like the good the bad and the ugly like how are the plants attracting pollinators one option is giving rewards another one is through deception and the last one is by doing traps which is very very interesting flowers flowers flowers there's a lot of flowers out there if you go out in the bush it's just a highly competition market flowers are not there just to be decoration in our houses they are actually actively doing something very important for the plants which is helping them reproduce flowers we could say that flowers are the genitals of the plants and to reproduce you need to attract things to help you reproduce plants do not have a pair of legs and they cannot just go into a nightclub and meet someone plants are in things that individuals that cannot move they don't have this pair of legs to move around so they need the help the assistance of other things and this will be the pollinators I want to clarify that not all the plants are pollinated by animals some plants will be wind pollinated such as the case for big important things that we eat such as rice and wheat however most of the other fruits will be animal pollinated and when you see a flower all these characteristics will be around what is it trying to attract it's a whole crazy world out there you can see all these shapes all these colors so these are just some examples of the traits that the flowers will be mixing trying to show out there and trying to attract a pollinator so just the size right if it's a bit lower it's not going to attract small be pollinated by big things in this case bats or rats or monkeys then time of the anthesis when is the flower opening think about it the flowers not open in the night will attract night creatures the flowers that opening the early morning will attract early birds and the flowers are open late in the evening will attract things that are active late in the evening second thing is the orientation so also where the flower is orienting if it's down if it's up if it's on the side the scent of course some flowers will smell really good some others will have very funky odors this is also related to who they are attracting to they have rewards which is very important right some animals depend on food that comes from plants which are these rewards pollen and nectar which are both produced by the flowers size and exposure again if you have big flowers big things small flowers very small things such as insects poly diversity look at this when you think about pollen and this I said before in the other slide it giving pollen is not just yellow dust it can come in all these colors and it's beautiful like it can be purple pink blue green so again this is related to what they want to attract flowers are producing different types of pollen in order to get different things coming to them so maybe certain pollen will have a very high protein content and some other pollen will have a less protein content so this is going to relate to what's attracting so just to understand a little bit more I want to really quickly introduce flower anatomy so these are just the basics which is the settles which are here I will try to draw here so you can see I will annotate so we have the samples down in the bottom then we have the petals then we have two really big important structures which are called the anther and the stigma the anther is the one that produces a pollen that is a male part of the flower the stigma it's a very sticky tube and that's where the pollen is deposited by so most flowers out there will have both male and female parts some flowers will be different in the way that sunflowers will only have male parts and some others will only have female parts but most of them will have both and it's very important to understand this in order to understand pollination so the anthers are producing the pollen and the stigma is just a sticky tube that will get the pollen and it will fertilize the eggs that are inside next one I don't know why I cannot sorry it's like computer is blogging I don't know why can I i cannot change my slide let me see um could you please stop screen sharing I think my screen sharing is boggy pollination pollination is moving pollen from the anthers to the stigma of another flower that's pollination once you do this then the flower is going to fertilize and then you'll get a fruit which is the main outcome of pollination so we have three main things that we need to take into account which is the number is the female part and number two the vector which is going to move this pollen to the stigma this can be the wind this can be the water but most of the times it's going to be an animal and most of the time it's going to be a big good there are a lot of types of pollination so just in a nutshell we have self-pollination which is when the same flower fertilizes itself it means that the pollen from the same flower goes to the stigma of the same flower and then you have a fruit another type is the north sabi which is a flower from the same plant fertilizes another flower from the same plant but then we have one which is very very important which is called cross pollination which is a flower from one plant fertilizes the flower from another plant individual cross pollination is very important because it's allowing this gene diversity so you get really good outcomes when it comes to the fruits there's a lot of differences in this so it's very important to understand't necessarily mean that it's pollinating it we need to be clear with this so we have visitation that blue bandit be showing us visitation the blue bandit be is visiting the flower taking food from it but it's not touching the anthers it's not getting any pollen that is not pollination then we have the middle one which is very interesting called accidental pollination that's the ladybug most ladybugs are actually carnivore so they do not eat nectar or pollen however they eat aphids and we know that aphids attack plants and they live around flowers so when the caterpillar is eating these aphids it might accidentally walk around the flower bath herself in pollen walk into another flower and pollinate the flower the final type is active pollination so this is when the bees are actively flying between flowers to get fruit food from the flowers and that is the active case of pollination which is the one that we will be focusing today's talk the big if you think about pollinators I want you to remind the big five bees I like we have birds we have butterflies we have bats and we have beetles there are heaps still more out there but these are just the big five bees to for us to start getting wrapping our head around pollinators these big five all go to flowers to get food bats will get nectar and pollen stain with beetles butterflies birds and bees however there's a lot of there and we still have this pollinator bias if I tell you name one pollinator I'm pretty sure you will name the honeybees because that's even me I named the honeybees that's the main pollinator bias I like to call it in the whole world mindset we keep talking about honeybees as the main pollinator but hey it's time to start talking about the rest there's a lot of cool things out there pollinating too so that is one of my favorites and I'm putting it there on the on the right side look at that one I call them the forgotten pollinators the black and white rough bloomer how beautiful this thing is this creature how cool is that one it's not a very common pollinator that we would name but it is a pollinator and same with hummingbirds for example or the monarch butterflies so it's time to start talking about the rest of the plein areas out there good now I want to start talking about these crazy um syndromes that we we find in nature I want to show you some cases of pollination that I find quite interesting so the first one is going to be the rewards what's the reward so this is when a an animal goes to a flower in order to get something out of it there's some kind of payment related to it what's the payment it's going to be either a scent which is like a perfume that the bee can get around herself or food which is pollen and nectar as we know so in this case the insect will be pollinating the flower but the flower it's also pain back it's a very nice it's giving a equality to both sides of the equation this so these are the mo this is one of the most common pollination syndromes which is the one where you get a reward from the flower and these are some examples for you to to understand so these are just some of them which is that butterfly is with its long proboscis we call it that big tongue it's absorbing that nectar from the flower while doing that it's that proboscis or tongue part of the butterfly is gonna get a lot of pollen when the butterfly flies into another flower it's gonna leave this pollen behind in the stigma and then you'll get pollination the same happens with the hummingbird when it sticks its long beak in one of the flowers it gets some pollen around it and then it's gonna also pollinate and then we have that bee as we most of us know I'm not putting honey bees because I don't want you to to be biased towards them but then this solitary bee it's also visiting the flowers to get that pollen and nectar which is so out there why because social pollinators such as the social bees like honeybees and stingless bees they live in these colonies of thousands of individuals and they are they don't get to be picky about the food that they like that's why we call them the generalists they need to visit most flowers out there in order to bring food for their sisters however when it comes to solitary bees and other types of bees and animals then they can get to be picky and start looking for certain flower traits just for you to have an idea this I'm not going to read all the lists for you but these are just the things that are pollinated by honeybees so it's a lot these two images are showing you a supermarket if you enter if honeybees were pollinating things which is a normal uh the normal situation where we enter the supermarket and then the image on the right is showing you what would happen if honeybees did not pollinate any of the crops that they normally pollinate so it would be quite a boring they do pollinate a lot of things out there but there's a big bot we keep talking about them and this is the same thing that I said at the beginning it's just biased towards this only type of pollinator and there's a lot out there even the honeybee there is asking where is everyone else we need to start talking about other pollinators and I i want to now walk you through some other pollinators that are more efficient than honeybees when it comes to producing the crop look at this this is just b diversity and I i studied this so I am a little bit biased towards talking about bs as pollinators but they are pretty cool and they come in all these colors and shapes not just colors now this is size so now we can see the smallest b compared to the biggest b in the world and then we have the honeybee just for giving us a little bit of a scale when it comes to the size great let's go back to pollination so I want to quickly go this kind of pollination it's a lot of movement so it needs to be that goes into the flower and just makes a really big mess why this flower can only release the pollen if it's really if you can see me in the camera the flower needs to be really really like heavily moved in order to release this pollen this is what I call the poor bearing anthers so flowers such as tomato flowers or eggplant flowers have this special type of structure so the pollen is not released that easily it needs to be heavily moved by the bee or whoever is pollinating it in order to be released who is the main boss pollinator out there the main hero we call it the bumblebee bumblebees are excellent boss pollinators they are very messy when it comes to visiting the flowers and they allow this pollen come out of the ants anthers when they land in it and when they are doing all these movements I want to clarify that honeybees also visit these flowers but they do not pollinate them so that's very on a flower doesn't necessarily mean that it's pollinating it okay I told you that the main hero is the bumblebee but what happens in australia we do not have bumblebees here we do have them in tasmania but they have been introduced and that's not an ideal case because they out-compete native species we do have some really good candidates and we have solitary bees that can make up for this uh gap solitary bees some of them can be really good boss pollinators so who are they blue banded bees for example teddy bear bees and carpenter bees are all found in sydney all found in different regions of australia and they are really good boss pollinators they are similar to honeybees in the way that they will land the flower on the flowers they will move the anthers and they will release this pollen allowing this pollination what fruits what things that we eat on a daily basis need boss pollination tomatoes who doesn't like tomatoes it's like the basis for a lot of things tomato sauce and pizza and all these and that's boss pollinated but also kiwis blueberries chilies and eggplant that's very important to have in mind second case I want to talk really quick it's apple pollination so look at this nice fluffy bee that's called osmia cornuta so next time you see an apple maybe honeybees are not behind it's this type of bee which is called a an osmia type of b or mason b these beasts look at the shape so this is what I want to emphasize in the whole presentation pollinators have evolved to present a shape that is going to be very efficient when it comes to pollinating their crop so with this very fluffiness that the bee has maybe she's very much efficient by carrying the pulling around and around all these hairs and pollinating the apple orchards honeybees also pollinate apollo charts but they are only 50 percent efficient compared to 98 efficiency when it comes to osmia carnota which is very very important next one is the the flies so flies not many people think they're pollinators and they're extremely important which is very interesting who are these flies the ones that I'm showing you are not the common house flight these are called the hoverflies and they mimic these and they their diet mainly consists in flowers so they get the pollen and the nectar from them and at the same time they pollinate these crops quickly I want to touch on cacao also so the chocolate that you maybe eat this week or this morning or whenever also we should be thanking flies so these are called the midgets cacao midges specifically these are tiny tiny little flies that visit these tiny tiny flowers that cacao produces and they are pollinating this very important crop so again we should not forget about the flies when it comes to pollination honorable mentions I want to give to the bats of course tequila plants for example that's pollinated by the bats tequila comes from agave which is these very nice plants that have very huge stems the flowers are really big white and they open in the night which is very interesting so they are attracting these pollinators another natural pollinator out there so this is the lemur the one that I was talking to you at the beginning so this guy is impressive it's in madagascar the way it's pollinating this palm it's by opening these um scales of the palm then he you need to be very strong in order to pollinate this plant why you can see on the image on the right the flowers are in this scale thingy so the lemur needs to open this with his bare hands then he can get access to the nectar while doing that and drinking this nice juice he gets a lot of pollen on the face he goes into another flower opening it puts that pollen in the flower and then he is able to pollinate okay finally I want to give the name to their cold-blooded pollinators which are super cool this is in an island in africa and this is a type of gecko and they also pollinate so who would think that lizards can also pollinate and he's an active pollinator which means the gecko diet mainly consists of around trying to get that nectar from the flower and then he's gonna be able to pollinate flower um great I would just like to uh let me see just before we wrap up I wanna show one last slide good there we go before we wrap up four questions I want to talk here about pollinators are facing a lot of problems out there so just for you to have in mind I like to talk about the positive things all the time I'm very positive but I also need to address the negative part which is most pollinators out there are facing problems why these are the main problems the pesticide that's a big problem for insects habitat degradation of course that's happening all over the world chopping up the forest it's taking down all this habitat but it's important for animals not just pollinators any any animal our plant out there are facing this main problem I think the lack of conservation it's it's the main problem so by doing this kind of talks it's great because how to protect them and I think a really good tool to to use is education the more we can spread the word about how fascinating they are and how cool they are the more we can protect them and do good things to for them to be there what's next for me I did my phd here I'm now applying for grants to study pollinators in madagascar so fingers crossed I will get them I just wanted to let you know where would I be next but I'm always contacted by zoom so that's fine and thank you so much for listening I could talk about pollinators for the next two hours but I know that we only have half an hour thank you so much for coming
Well good afternoon everybody and it's a pleasure to be able to present this today had a very significant time in the development of the m6 offset projects because the first stage of it is about it was handed over recently that is the brighton memorial component of the work um brighton memorial we'll show you some um in this we'll show you some uh photos and so forth during construction um sorry yeah and it's a very exciting project for us of the and the work was done um by the transport for new south wales as offset work to the m6 uh project so during the m6 works there will be there'll be um some of the fields will be taken up and so this was to offset that inconvenience during construction um the project in total is on the three sites brighton memorial is the first to be handed over um then mccarthy field uh which is on the western side of muddy creek it will be handed over soon and then at the end of the year the third part of old brighton bowling club um the project in total require it involves two synthetic fields smaller playing fields a skate park some a regional playground it's very significant in what in what's being delivered for the community um um at the start the project was there was community engagement to see what the community what the community's needs were and these were addressed and once that was addressed and the and a working group was formed we set about giving the transport for new south wales in their working we worked collaboratively with them so that council's specification and our brief was delivered upon now they interpreted our brief and the way they interpreted it was was was very successful and we were partners at every stage city project's involvement was to ensure that once the the plans and specifications were agreed that they were delivered upon and so now we've at a stage where the bright memorial component of the work is is um is finished and handed over and the public are enjoying it it involves it involves a new sports amenity field and a playground area that interfaces with the school next door all of these I'm sure that the school will enjoy the facilities too because it's open you know to to the public it's not locked off it's always available in the sports amenity building it's uh it's in it it has public toilets that are 24 7. um there's a a one of the real features of this being a war memorial is the memorial wall and it's not just glorification of war but it's it's like a history lesson from our involvement in the boer war right through to the afghanistan conflict and the peacekeeping forces that australia so you can walk from that northern end of the wall which is a semi-circle around and you can see plaques and memorial to all of those conflicts that australian troops have been involved with um other elements that uh pick up this are the the the planting is this rosemary and things like that that are you know associated with memorials of this type there's also the concrete finishes and in the signage so no one can enter this park without realizing that there's something special going on here and um it's um I really commend it to you it's a peaceful area and the planting is substantial and it's really transformed this this area um the um sport so um this is the before and after if you can see there that was the before uh um the memorial field and uh in the shot of of after as you can see it's a significant change the field on the left hand side is natural turf and it's a mini field and the field on the right hand side is a new synthetic now with synthetic fields of course we've got to deal with the overland flow so that there's been significant drainage upgrades all there to to um to divert water so that it doesn't there's no overland flow over the synthetic um you might jump into the video um if I can just whoops the screen's just not allowing me to get there showcase the facility so I think that was a great little snippet of uh I suppose what we were just looking at the before and after photos and I suppose that after photo that we saw was basically uh a design image of what we wanted to achieve in that space and I suppose the video now captures uh the real life product that has been develo I suppose delivered to the community um as of uh friday the 1st of october which is super exciting yes and it has been well received although I don't think it's been discovered that much yet from the public when I go down there there's not that many people there so they've got the peace and quiet down there at the present time but I'm sure that the public will get to know that it's there very soon because it's been a construction site for some time yeah okay we might jump into I know bernie there's a lot of people that often think about the construction stage and I know the project goes through key things that transport were able to do was actually capture during the construction uh do a time lapse of all the construction that occurred and it's actually quite interesting to watch that so we might jump in and if you want me to stop at any point in time let let me know just wait for that to load so as you can see it's going super quick yeah so the slab the slab for the amenities building there on the left hand side and a bit of framing up already so we're well into the construction at this stage with the structural steel frame is is up um the little thing like the top these um uh windrows here of of stockpiled material uh so they were all reused so that's the top soil strip from the site so that was that was all reutilized on on the side um so the synthetic field that's at a stage there with it where the subgrade is is complete and they're just about ready to put a drainage cell down that's where that well and truly in advance there yeah what are they doing here bernie so that's the drainage cell all southern and see that's it laid out so underneath the synthetic field you you've got to you've got to capture the water that's that falls on the field and dispose of it so the synthetic field has a one percent fall so the water runs drains off and and so that's the drainage cell component that's underneath the the synthetic okay cool and what the white material going down there now is the shock pad that's like a rubber that they put on top of the drainage to sell yep and you can see um over here the amenities has progressed as well yeah yeah speed was a lot to do with this so the way that they construct the way they interpreted our brief was to go with construction techniques that were were fast um sometimes councils the council might choose to use um a different material but the process and procedures that they went through was based upon speed and they the carpet being laid yeah pretty close to finishing there yep so new you can see the new light poles being installed have been installed since the so that was one of the upgrades as well of course new lighting yep I think line marking and those black spots on there that's the the in film material going in now the camera changes as the synthetic was finished the camera changes to the other angle and shows the car park component and the playground you can see coming up in the in in the foreground there and that interfaces brilliantly with the school next door so I can see that being used by the primary school a lot the building is is very much approaching completion there what we're looking at there is the canteen that that faces the oval the referees room is just behind that so the referees get their own change room in this development now what we're seeing here is the development of the semi-circular wall that concrete wall is what is what houses the memorial plaques all the way around so you and so that's where you just walk and you can just follow australia's military history right from bull wall right through and it it it includes a memorial to the first aboriginals who was a commissioned officer in the australian army there's things like that of a very unique um significance in australia's war history I think that's kind of I think there's only a couple of more screenshots after that and then it completes yeah yeah yeah so planting is significant too you know there's some very substantial well well mature trees too that have been included yeah so we're back we're back to where we started it looks like charlene yes we are absolutely yeah um so I suppose that really um showcases the brighton memorial and as you said um bernie we are also upgrading um mccarthy and adol and there's some of the in the video at the top here you can see some of those um sites as well but I suppose today we're just focused on um really focused on brighton memorial um park precinct and the mccarthy reserve about the new facilities I know they're on track burning for end of um end-of-year delivery mccarthy is probably in advance of that so yeah there'll be probably two handovers one for mccarthy and one for the the area um east of of muddy creek okay fantastic I know one of the other key questions that I get asked is how do I stay up to date with what's happening uh with the project whether it be the new facilities or or with the tunnel one of the things that transport have done is they've created a a web portal or a project site for the stage one we will pop the link in to the chat after uh the presentation if you would like to subscribe to any updates on the project when you're on the home page uh you can click here to subscribe to the um updates if you wanted to read more information about the new facilities you can click on the new recreational facilities um did anyone have any have any questions or sharon'll just put my video on and say hello to everyone um hi everyone I'm sharon I'm community engagement at bayside council um so at the moment we don't really have any questions in the chat um about the playing fields at the moment I suppose I had a question just about the memorial plaques um bernie how did they sort of come about were they were they there previously or are they is that a whole new installation or no it's a whole new installation and um yeah there was quite a bit of work community consultation with with local groups and in particular yaracell and it really is something special it's um it's um it really pays homage and for those of us who who love our history too it takes us through that in chronological order and you know australia's um it's very significant our contribution to not just to war but to peace keeping movements as well um yeah um so it yeah it's it and and the whole thing has also like the planting and the casually walk and read those plaques and feel a million miles away as you as you read that it's it's yeah it's brilliantly done I think um I have another couple of questions that have popped up so someone said the synthetic field looks great which is good to hear um and someone said great to add first nations first officer in the armed forces so that's something um I would have into the memorial plaques that are already there now to see what's there but um or potentially we could look into that and see how we came to those memorial plaques or the names of them on there at the moment are they specific people's names that are on there or there are in that instance yes that the the um the his officer in charge is the scene there uh awarding him his commission so that's okay and everything's open again all our parks and facilities are open post covered I believe is that the 25th of october or they is this open now because we're eighty percent people to go down there and just um and appreciate what this facility is to the community it's um kick a ball around yeah but yeah maybe get in before the crowd start getting in I'm sure it'll become very popular because it's in there behind houses I don't think that many people realize it's it's there obviously people who are aware of the old um brighton memorial club and know it's there but it was no it's more than a practice field now it's it's a destination to go to absolutely yeah it looks like a really beautiful place I think with those with all of those beautiful plants with the rosemary and things like that and having those it's sort of like a bit of a day out where you can go and do stuff down there and look at those and take the kids and stuff and have a play in the playground um someone else just said this upgrade seems seems to have it all yes great contribution to the local area absolutely I lots of new is that all new equipment and things oh yes all new equipment yeah yeah excellent there's a much bigger playground in the uh in the uh eastern side of um that will come online later okay that's the one that's being highlighted there here oh okay so yeah in the old bowling club side here oh excellent okay that looks amazing and the change rooms and the back to the playing field so that's a whole is that a whole new is that a stadium there or no no that's the roof of the sports amenity building okay great well it's very big includes the change rooms and a canteen and that includes um referees change room in a first aid room yeah great toilets um so another question here where does the cyclist and pedestrian path lead to do we know that it's just from it goes from civil lane to to around the playground at the school so yeah it terminates there but if you wanted to ride a bike through there and appreciate the the facility on take off from o'neill street through civil lane and and gently ride around there because there'll probably be people on the path but yeah a slow bike ride through that area excellent um I don't see any other questions I don't know if anyone has any more questions that they'd like to ask bernie or charlene I think shelley maybe you could show us where you can find out information on our bayside council website so if you jump onto the council uh website and you use the search feature and you type in m6 stage one it will take you to a page um take you to this page actually and it will talk about the project impacts of the uh tunnel um on our parks and facilities it will showcase the new facilities that we're getting um which bernie and I have briefly touched on and then it will also talk about uh key project updates and quick links um and then just more information but like I said I really strongly encourage people to subscribe to receive those project updates because for um both mccarthy and also for um the new edel precinct uh park as well and continue to stay up to date with what's happening with the tunnel as well excellent that's good that's very easy to find so um I'm not sure if anyone um that's with us today would like to ask any more questions while we have the expertise of charlene and bernie here about anything on the playing fields or the playgrounds etc um otherwise I don't know if we have any more videos that we could show charlene or is there any close-ups of the playground or someone's out of the questions in regard to did we have any challenges faced with regard to contaminated land um brighton memorial is pretty clean they did when they stripped the old tennis courts on the corner there was some bonded asbestos which was um which was treated um as um uh as an unexpected find and we have clearance certificates and and that's been capped so there's there's no no significant there's well there's um very important aspect I would presume um and probably unexpected stumbled across by your team bernie but obviously or rectified now yeah it's very rare to in sydney unfortunately to find areas that are free of asbestos in those sort of small quantities so building workers are very yeah okay with being able to deal with them when they the unexpected find comes up so yeah yeah and sharon to your question about photos unfortunately with the covered restrictions and then with the enormous amounts of

area I'll key events for the rockdale volunteer fire brigade and other fire brigades in the local area I will mostly cover the period from the 1880s to around 1902 when the rockdale brigade was replaced by paid staff just having trouble that's right okay so um prior to 1884 there were no was no government called ordination of fire brigades so there were some volunteer and insurance companies formed in that period in 1884 the fire brigades board was established at first it was only in charge of the sydney fire district but gradually its responsibilities extended across the state in 1910 the board of fire commissioners replaced the earlier board and it too was replaced in 1990 by new south wales fire brigades in 2011 its name was changed to new south wales fire and rescue to better reflect the nature of its work the west botany municipal district was proclaimed in 1871 its name was changed to rockdale municipality from 1888. in the late 1880s the need for a rockdale brigade was demonstrated by fires rockdale was not part of the sydney fire district on the 6th of botany caught fire the haylock was destroyed including about three and a half tons of straw although west botany was not within the municipal metropolitan fire boundaries sorry the veteran fire brigades boundary the fire was attended by the newtown volunteer company assisted by the metropolitan fire brigade with a manual engine an event which must have been a catalyst for the creation of the rockdile brigade occurred on the 5th of december of 1889. at 12 45 a.m it was discovered that the masonic hall bay street rockdale was a light the building of three floors consisting of two shops hall and offices was burnt out and partly fallen down one of the shops was occupied by w semple grosser whose stock and furniture were damaged by removal the newtown volunteer company attended the blaze with stand pipes the masonic hall building was insured for 1 hundred pounds and its contents for three hundred unfortunately for mr simple he had no insurance the earliest mention of the rockdale volunteer fire brigade is found in the minutes of rockdale municipal council meeting held on the 28th of august of 1890. fire brigade wrote to the council asking for the use of a piece of land at the rear of the town hall upon which to wreck a wrecked fire station on the motion of alderman judd and cook the request referred to the works committee this indicates that st george's fire brigade had been formed before the 28th of august 1890 it should be noted that the rockdale volunteer fire brigade and the st george's fire brigade or company are used interchangeably in official sources the first fire station was at the rear of the town hall in 1890 two fires were attended by the rockdale brigade brigade had canvassed the local community for donations and were proud to obtain their own five-inch manual engine drawn by one horse a major event for the rockdale brigade occurred on the 24th of september in 1890 when governor lord carrington and lady carrington visited rockdale and brighton the vice regal party which had arrived at the rockdale train station then took a special tram to the grounds of thomas sails hotel at brighton where lady carrington had previously arranged to christening their engine belonging to the newly formed local volunteer fire brigade lady carrington christened the fire engine mye after the christian name given to lady carrington's youngest child the name signifying in aboriginal language native born this name was recorded at the special request of the fire brigade to which her ladyship exceeded the event was attended by fire brigades from newtown waverly paddington brewery darlington and the standard brewery with their engines fully equipped the newspaper account also includes the first mention of the names of members of the st george's volunteer fire company including the captain g judd the honorary secretary george tucker who had already corresponded with the council and the honorary treasurer alfred arnold george tuckwall was well known to the council as he was employed as one of its overseers of works you can see in the picture here the des moines fire brigade's manual engine which would have been similar to rockdale brigade's mye in november 1890 london banks were no longer making loans to australia in 1891 the australian colonies were in an economic depression in february 1892 south wales by depositors and there was much unemployment in the following years on the 6th of april 1891 st george volunteered fire brigade had written to the fire brigades board to request an extension of the telephone line to rockdale town hall rockdale volunteer fire brigade was not registered with the fire brigades board so the fire brigades board was unable to assist in 1892 council under mayor william taylor met three times to consider whether to register under the fire brigades act but the council decided not to proceed due to the state of its own finances in this some depressed period in 1893 mr c.f kinsella a local undertaker urged the council to get a telephone exchange built at rockdale as this would reduce the costs for local businesses such as his but the council could not support the expense alderman william taylor a rockdale who can be seen to the left of this photo supported the rockdale company to set up their fire station near the town hall within taylor served on the fire brigades board and later on the board of fire commissioners from 20th 2nd of february of 1894 the provisions of the fire brigades act of 1884 were extended to hurtsville and rockdale and each council's contributions were to start from 1895. the contributions were based on the assessed annual value of property in the municipality rockdale wrote to the colonial secretary to protest at the imposition on the council the contributions however meant that the fire brigade was eligible for subsidies from the fire brigades board there were 15 men on the rockdale volunteer company's role at this time registration meant abiding by the rules and regulations of the fight brigades board they specified that no members should be under the age of 21 nor over the age of 32 unless previously engaged as an active fireman no licensed victor was to be allowed to remain or be admitted as a member every company was to send a role of its members to the board the working strength of the company was to be not less than 15 men and not more than 40 active members drunkenness insubordination smoking in uniform and other unseenly conduct is not to be tolerated a fire was discovered at kempton street in rockdale in the brick dwelling with an iron roof of john graham the cause of the blaze was tar boiling over the back kitchen on the ground floor and its contents were severely damaged by fire and water the hall and contents of the back room of the same floor were damaged by water the flames were extinguished by the household and neighbours using buckets of water sadly james graham aged five years was severely burned about his body he later died as a result of the fire his father john graham aged 35 years was severely burned about the hands arms and head and was attended to at prince alfred hospital camperdown on the 9th of february of 1895 rockdale obtained a hose reel and by april so did cobra by the 24th of january on this 24th of january 1895 the sun georgia's volunteer fire brigade wrote inviting council's attendance at the christening of their hospital on saturday the 9th of february at 4 30 p.m ceremony to be formed by mrs taylor nearest of rockdale a fancy is from the wollongong fire brigade it shows how the hose reel was operated it was drawn by two firemen so they had to be very fit this is the reason why many early fire stations were located at the top of a hill it made it easier to get a good running start rockdile being quite a hilly area would have made it hard work superintendent william bear was the head of the fire brigades board staff and liaise with all the local fire brigades fire fires were attended by rockdale in 1895. on saturday the 9th of november 1895 a fire was discovered at hermann street rockdale in the home of george leader no call was received but the copper and brockdale volunteer fire companies both attended with one hydrant the weatherboard house of six rooms with contents was burned out and the iron roof was partly off the course was unknown the contents were insured for 60 pounds and the building for 40 pounds in 1895 the rockdale volunteer company had a full range of equipment including one horse two scaling ladders one hose reel two hand advising the league for new hoses a grant was received in 1896 for a new fire station to build at rockdale and land was purchased and plans prepared rockdale fire station was opened in june of 1897. this station was located on rocky point road now princess highway about 10 frontages down south of bay street you can see some of the features of the fire station such as the lamp with the word fire on it outside the engine bay on the left the accommodation upstairs and the fire alarm next to the doorway what you can't see is the paddock next door for the horse in the engine bay you can be seen the harness for the horses there are stories at many fire stations that the horse would step forward as soon as the alarm was sounded ready for the harness to be lowered we only know the names of two of the rockdale horses warrior and rose in 1897 rockdale fire brigade was finally collected connected to the telephone line which be built from newtown to rockdale and then on chicago early fire alarms included station which then alerted the local brigades this was the time when almost no one had their own telephone each alarm's location was known so time was saved in knowing where to send the brigade to the fire on the 24th of march of 1897 a fire alarm on the corner of botany road and bay street was knocked over when a horse ran away and into the alarm which had to be then repaired in 1897 a volunteer company was formed rehearsal and would soon be linked to rockdale and cobra fire station by telephone and more alarms would be installed in key locations I was delighted to find among superintendent bears papers this 1897 memorandum from the rockdale volunteer fire brigade you can see the fireman in the middle with his hose ready to pull out the put out the flames with several manual engines pumping away while the men in their top hats look on it is quite an exciting scene and I think it shows the pride that the rockdale volunteer fire brigade had in their work here we can see some of the brigades pipe in the middle there along with the men in their clean uniforms with their shiny buttons and their long boots cobra municipal council wrote to the fire brigades board on the 6th of december 1893 that it had obtained the names of 18 persons who have enrolled themselves into a volunteer fire brigade and requested the necessary apparatus and an instructor to drill and then be supplied on the 20th of december 1893 superintendent bear recommended that the hose reel at number three station which was a circular key he sent and that he be allowed to order 600 foot of hose the new station and the board agreed subject to proper housing being provided for the apparatus a weatherboard station was the first one built at cogra and it was then replaced by the present station which is in the picture and it's located on grey street at the corner of kensington street superintendent alfred webb replaced superintendent bear in september of 1898. he had been bears deputies since 1888. on friday the 19th of may 1899 at 11 47 p.m a fire occurred in the premises rockdale and cogwood volunteer fire companies attended with one hydrant a quantity of shingling and a portion of fencing was destroyed by fire in the yard joining the premises the contents were uninsured and is not known whether the weatherboard building with an iron roof was insured on the morning of thursday the 23rd of march of 1899 a passing steam train set fire to the grass on the railway siding near cunningham's paddock rockdale it nearly caused a serious outbreak as a very strong wind was blowing at the time the flames spread dangerously close to the tenements in the paddock farm enjoyed chetham of the rockdale brigade prevented the flames from spreading some railway officials and federers joined him with buckets of water and other appliances together they succeeded in stamping up the fire if it had reached these tenements they would not have been saved here we see the men of the colgar volunteer fire brigade the men generally are not wearing fire brigade uniforms the subsidy provided by the fire brigades board did not always stretch far enough to enable new uniforms to be purchased secretary of the rockdale volunteer fire brigade wrote requesting the board provide 30 pounds to purchase uniforms for the members he continued I might point out to you the uniform now worn by the members was purchased seven years ago and is now in the most disgraceful state being torn with working at different fires I assure you that it is not does not sound very well for the general public to criticize us as dirty looking firemen through the faulty looking joe uniform has now attained in fact some of our members have not got uniforms to wear and any new member coming into the grade at once sees for himself that we have not bought uniforms and at once leaves as I feel sure that no man will spoil his own clothes as the majority of the members of working men and could not possibly sustain the loss the request for 30 pounds was refused as the yearly subsidies of the company had been raised by 20 pounds first of all fire station is shown here at its opening on anniversary day the 26th of january of 1898. rochdale was invited to the celebration and participated in a friendly grain of cricket hurstville won by 48 runs cogra had a one-horse one-horse hose carriage and her school was to have either an engine or a coast carriage at 12 15am on wednesday the 22nd of february 1899 an alarm was raised at the cottage in kimberley road festival was on fire coastal fire brigade turned out but were unable to save the weatherboard cottage but did save the adjoining property mr a dye a well-known cricket bat manufacturer lost about 200 bats stored on the premises and all his machinery but he was insured the st george observer newspaper enthused too much praise cannot be given to the hostile firemen for the way they worked to save the premises it was the first fire the personal firemen had battled with by themselves the saint george's advocate reported the larger manual from rockdale arrived shortly after the hurstville brigade and found that hustle had all available hose out so they simply stood by to render any necessary aid the observer more pointedly stated that the rockdale fire brigade the men of the hustful volunteer fire brigade here note their helmets and uniforms and their neatly rolled hoses the standpipes and their axes on friday the 28th of june 1898 charles munford's brick home with a slate roof at mill street first full caught fire being discovered at 2 50 p.m and the alarm was received at 2 54. it was recorded that rats at matches was the cause the roctal volunteer fire company attended and extinguished a fire with a private hose lumber in the bathroom at the rear of the dwelling were damaged by fire and water while the contents were uninsured the building was destroyed for 3 000 pounds no doubt it must have been an impressive home we can see the offices of the rockdale district fire brigade posed in the engine bay displaying their ladders standpipes and clean uniforms one of the young men may be russell who lived at the station with his wife and it is possible that the man with the beard seated on the right may have been charles royal thomas sale of brighton hotel and sales tram was brighton hotel the band began in february of 1899 with a class for beginners held in the building room of the rockdale fire station j.c walker was the band master there was no official connection with the fire brigade though some musicians including william long were also members of the fire brigade all right on the 9th of august 1901 the band held its first annual social at thomas stable brighton her arm hall at lady robinson's beach brighton the principal item was a comic military band sketch which created uproarious laughter I'm gonna end that the story for the the volunteer company really ends in 1902 when the fibregates board actually paid for the staff to attend at the station we're going to move on now to the the various fire brigades and fire stations in the bay both the bayside and george's river um area I won't read all of this but just quickly you can see the order that the various stations were established so we had rockdale in 1890 cobra following in 1895 percival in 1897 bexley in 1905 uh it uh north botany station was established in 1904 as a volunteer company uh botany in eight in 1905 fort followed in 1908 and the original on cliff station was established in 1909 and the most recent station there is actually riddlewood and you can see that the station number from riverwood is the same as the station number for the original bexley station I have a few photos to show you now of the various stations so this one here is the the next rockdale fire brigade station and it's actually around the corner in bay street 41 bay street at rockdale and it eventually became I think it was a triple children um building after it stopped being used by the fire brigade in 2006. and here's the the modern armcliff fire station which were the successes of the original rockdale company here we have the earlier armcliff fire brigade which was established in 1909 and they're showing off their um their fire engine there in 1910 and here's their station their station is on the corner of what was on the corner of faro a lot of stations around sydney were actually closed in 1945 because horses had been replaced by motor fire engines which were unable to cover the greater system were able to cover greater distances than the horses could therefore fewer stations were needed we have the hurstville fire station from 1912 in marne street I'll be familiar to many of you it's now I think a doctor's surgery this is the second site that was used and a new one was brought in in 1993 which is located in norman parade in hurstville here we have the mascot fire station in coward street mascot actually started off as north botany uh it was established in 1904 and was renamed in 1912 as mascot and defense station number 26. here we have the botany fire station in banksia street and a voluntary company was had been established there in 1905 and it became station number 35 and its first permanent staff were appointed in 1912 is the mort dale fire brigade in 1920 mortal you can see here had an engine that was drawn by two horses the and the land there was laid sold to become the commonwealth banking water here we can see that station today uh interesting part of this is that originally the weatherboard building that was at um copper station was actually dismantled and moved to more delby to become its first station and it was then subsequently in 1912 replaced by the station you can see now and I just thought I'd end with the current fire and rescue of today you can see here this is the hurstville fire brigade station number 20 and I've put up a few links there there's the fire rescue website uh new south wales state r class holds a lot of information on history of fire brigades and also there's the museum of fire at penrith at that point I think I will hand back now to allison for question time thank you all for listening
Um yes thanks and thanks for everyone for um logging on during your lunch time if it indeed it is your lunch time this is a a real walk down memory lane for me um a virtual walk down memory lane I haven't had a chance to get over to daceyville in the last couple of weeks as I've been preparing this but I wrote a phd thesis way back when submitted in 96 um focusing on the importance of parks and gardens and flowers and um green spaces for the creation of ideal citizens in sydney and that was an idea that began in the last couple of decades of the 20th century centennial park is um really part of that movement and dacyville being a garden suburb daisy garden suburbs is its first name called daceyville by the 1920s uh was a wonderful implementation of that ideal so I've been going back over my thesis and um recovering photographs and all and and I'll begin you can see there an aerial view on that title page of what daceyville was supposed to be so epitome of the zeal for town planning in the early 20th century and I'll talk more about that as we move along but for a little while I'll just give you the back story and we'll we'll go to the kenzie and london if we if you don't mind um literally the london of dickens you know 1830s and 40s and we get that term dickensian because of the descriptions of um of the the the shambolic crowded miserable conditions that many people lived in in london and also in fact in the other industrial cities of britain at the time birmingham and manchester people living on top of each other slums being really dreadful no proper infrastructure um yeah exactly what we mean by that by the term dickensian here's an illustration from george kurashank from uh dickens early writing which there's an expose on the type of people who inhabit these these cities london at that time was two million people um so 1840s 1841 just over 2 million by 1861 it's well over 3 million people so it is um problems that follow on from that inadequate sewage no town planning what whatsoever at this time people putting up things wherever they can wherever there's a space um by the end of the 19th century people in britain have begun to wonder about a better way to do things and we get the beginning of what we under what I understand um is modern town planning here's a beautiful illustration of bedford park which is one of the first planned suburbs in london the building's designed by richard norman shaw very significant architect and and town planner as well um I think it was mainly a sort of a grid of street so not particularly innovative in terms of its layout but what it did do was ensure high quality architecture villas surrounded by gardens with public parks for those who could afford it and this was pitched at a solid middle upper middle class market richard norman shaw is really significant because he's one of the um the principal people in what I call and and other people call also the the english revival roofs wall hung shingles brick um it's almost a form of gothic but a domesticated form of gothic and it's a very different to the classical style of architecture which was all the rage in the fashion up until the 1820s and indeed was the style when um when sydney was established by the the british you know so that was the that was the style of architecture in early colonial sydney so richard norman shaw very important for english revival I'll get back to that in a moment um the other significant chap is ebenezer howard now he's the the really the archetype of the um the movement called the garden city movement wrote two very important books this is the second of them garden cities of tomorrow um and the significance of of howard is that he emphasizes the importance of green space and access to parks and gardens and the countryside and this um illustration you see here which appeared in his first book in 1898 and it's reproduced in this one 1902 um sets out the idea of of the suburb realize so it's it's halfway between country and city so it's got all the advantages of both and here he is laying out the three magnets the problem with the country lack of museums lack of interesting things the problem with the town which is it's too congested no no nature and the ideal is town country and that's the one that's the magnet down the bottom and that's essentially his suburban ideal so fields and parks and low rates low low prices bright homes and gardens there it is here's another illustration from his earlier book tomorrow a peaceful path to real reform um where you see his garden city it's not really it's not very easy to imagine a city looking like this at all but he's got all these ideal places this sets up in a in a little bit of a cryptic way the notion of zoning which is uh an ideal an idea central to modern town planning but one that hadn't occurred to people earlier than the 19th century so you've a result people living next to rivers that are polluted and whatever howard is is important because he stresses the need for areas for industry areas for residents areas for civic activities and I mean this is a schematic idea of that and that's what the ideal was when it was realized this is hamston garden suburb uh begun or the or the um the paperwork signed in 1906 and it's and it's on its way to being established by 1910 um the architect there is raymond you can see the style of houses very similar to richard norman shaw's bedford park the image I showed earlier very english and here already the the streets of um the trees in the streets are um are established the idea that there are plantings in streets are very important um and pay attention here to that curvy street too that's going to be important and I'll explain that a bit more um in a moment so hampton garden so but hampstead rather garden suburb is essentially a suburb of london you may have heard of welland as well lychworth's rather um they're two garden cities so this ideal wasn't just an ideal it was actually implemented and successfully so problem is it costs a bit more so it wasn't a doctor all over the place so let's fast let's um move across the other the world to australia you might think well why would australia suffer from the same problems that crowded london or um manchester or birmingham might well it was on a lesser scale but it was sydney went from um get my fingers right well at this time this illustration was um uh engraved in 1888 sydney had 400 000 people in it crowded into it and that had doubled over the last um couple of decades so it was bursting at the seams already in 1859 the rocks area of sydney was being compared to the worst places in london there was a um a commission an inquiry into the condition of the working classes in 1859 it was it was chaired by henry parks and that's the first uh time that I know of cottages for the working class was flagged because they were focusing on areas around the rocks miller's point darling harbour and and looking at the substandard crowded tiny little um terrace houses um that existed there and thought something has got to be done and we need to come up with a better idea for housing the working classes and you can see even in this image here by full wood what is essentially a celebratory picture of the sydney that has grown up in a century just a century since colonization 1888 um look look what we've done isn't that marvellous he can't but portray darling harbour which is in the foreground there is a fairly dark grimy place and and it is in fact um darling harbour and the area around rocks and miller's point the plague breaks out in january 1900 so there is a real wake-up call and as a result there were lots of photographs taken of the areas around miller's point and the rocks and here is one of dozens of photographs taken by the government photographer showing gutters crowded into terrace houses that really are only two rooms upstairs and two room downstairs and you might have six eight or even ten people in that the housing typically was already built by the 1850s and and I mentioned how um crowded sydney was becoming so what was already a fairly dense area was becoming absurdly over pro populated as a result they resumed a lot of those areas around the rocks and they tore a lot of that housing down um and one of the models for rehousing people was more terraces and if you're familiar with miller's point and the rocks today you have probably seen these rows of what are still terraced houses but much more spacious there is houses they were um one solution to the problem realizing that the people who lived in those areas near the waterfront often worked on the waterfront they were coal lumpers or they were wolfies and therefore they needed to live near where they worked so space was at a premium and we need to repeat the idea of terrace house which is a very and but we need to improve on that basic model and so here's wh fogget his name will come up again as we move into daisyville designing these model terraces um for the newly established new south wales housing board in 1911. the housing board was established by the first labor government of new south wales who were idealists they were social reformers and um town planning and model suburbs were a huge part of their social reform agenda now just before I forget in case I forget to mention these are the properties that remained um public housing until very recently and and at least their leases if not the freehold have been sold into the private market so these so um miller's point and the rocks are being gentrified even more than they were already by the the sale of what was public housing here's another model of that time this um the strickland buildings in chippendale um chippendale was another slum area like like the rocks a lot of the terrace housing there was torn down because it was regarded as substandard in the least some of the people who were displaced they built this um three-story block of flats which is the closest thing that australia had at the time to those european and american style tenements not as intense not as dense as those but three stories block of flats um 67 flats eight shops designed by the city architect robert broderick for sydney city council so that's we've got the the state government the new labour government involving itself in planning and we've got um the city of sydney what is now called the city of sydney involved in um re-housing people this didn't accommodate all those who were displaced by the demolition resumption and demolition of the of the um terraces but it accommodated some a lot of the people who are working here I suspect worked in the brewery um nearby the tooth brewery so 1912 1914 important dates the other thing that was happening in sydney is that um there is a town planning movement beginning the association is formed in 1914 but private enterprises picking up on the message that people like ebenezer up of this idea and it was seen in haberfield which is many people know as a garden suburb as a great way of marketing the new suburban life so haberfield was a garden suburb in that all the houses had fairly spacious gardens and it wasn't a particularly innovative street design they're mainly sort of grid a grid of streets but there were parks provided as well so there's that's how private enterprise um implements the garden suburb ideal as early as 1909. most of most of haberfield has survived today and is is I'm pretty sure it's on the state heritage register or though some of it was destroyed with the recent um road building activities so here are four important characters um to do with the town planning movement walter liberty vernon was the government architect from 1890 to 1911 to the the beginning of the daceyville story he's not involved directly in daceyville but he's very important because he is a british immigrant and an architect who brings across the ideas of richard norman shaw who I mentioned and into the first decade of 20th century is very english and in fact it informs what we regard as a quintessential australian style federation architecture a lot of the elements of federation architecture are taken directly from that english revival he's also very interested in town planning but he wasn't directly involved in daceyville john roland daisy after whom the suburb was named was a colonial treasurer very interested in um town planning from the 1890s he's the only treasurer for a short time he dies in 1912. um but I have a quote from him here to give you an idea of of his ideal for the suburb and he's saying in 1911 in this free australia there is no submerged tenth and I do not want to carry out a scheme i.e daceyville which could enable people to put their noses in the air and say that is where the working classes live the object will be to establish homes for the people irrespective of their occupations well I'll talk more about the people who live there in due course but he provided funding enough to build this remarkable model suburb desi bill which only had just begun when he died in 1912. so there's john sorman there who like vernon was a um an english immigrant and an architect and very interested and knowledgeable in town planning writing about that as well as the 1890s both of them come out in the 1880s um and he is one of the architects of the first um daceyville plan along with john hennessy and then the last chapter you can see there is jd fitzgerald who's the third the third person to have an input into that daceyville plan he is an irishman an absolute labor reformer becomes the first chairman of the new south wales housing board very interested in um making a better life for working people and here is that first design that um sulman hennessy and fitzgerald put together uh you can see it it's not a particularly innovative design there's a bit of a radial pattern going on there the houses that had already been built by 1912 you can see on the top little bit but most of that and across to bunnerong road was developed but what um what you can see beyond there those plans for other streets was not as a designed um garden suburb it certainly was built up as suburbia and it became page would in large part but um it wasn't realised in this form and that's what the countryside looked like on that sort of south south south eastern edge of the city it's essentially old sand dunes um scrubby country dismissed as wasteland because it is sand dunes and there wasn't a full appreciation of this being a valid ecosystem in its own right probably degraded a bit at this point it's referred to here as virgin countries if nothing had happened to it um but it was seen as an ideal place to build a model suburb because there's nothing there there's no forest to clear there are no pre-existing buildings um and so the government bought up the land I think it was privately owned and they resumed it and they started building the suburb in major plan um and this was the one put together by wh foggett who was the architect for the housing board and the streets here become much more curvaceous and also by 1917 you can see how many buildings have been built ultimately 315 cottages of several hundred were realized and the rest weren't and I'll tell you why well I might as well tell you now because of the first world war essentially the building begins in 1912 continues on through 13 14 15 and 17 up to 17 when this plan is put together but of course the war breaks out in 1914 and that's a huge distraction and it's a huge um well lots of resources go on on to the to the war effort interestingly daceyville gets a bifurcated identity as a result when it was begun in 1912 the idea was that it would be this pioneering um historic suburb and so the names that were given to the the streets were historical names you've got banks you've got cooks cooks um cook avenue rather and when the as added hague park um you've got larkin crescent after the first chapter be killed at gallipoli in 19 in april 2000 sorry april 25 1915 so it becomes a suburb that takes on an identity almost as a as a war suburb and some people regard it as a soldier's settler suburb like metroville was but it wasn't it was it predated that idea and here's um one of foggett's first designs for for the houses very english you can see that striped um gable that's straight out of medieval england that's the the reference there you see that on lots of um buildings in in um sydney suburbs up until the 1920s but it's straight out of the english revival this is a fairly straightforward layout because it's it's a semi-detached house you know almost like a gun barrel format just you head up the um up the center of the house essentially um the other styles of housing were much more innovative that's what a semi-detached looks like from the front already in 1915 you can see their residence and this was advertised in the paper the only um requisite was that you couldn't own property you're allowed to apply for um a lease in one of these houses as long as you didn't own anything anywhere else and the rents were very competitive um but here are some of the detached houses that were built far more akin to what we would regard as a a modern dwelling without of course the open plan two bedrooms three bedrooms there was a real variation in style of houses to accommodate as many types of families as possible because daisy said he wanted this not to be a working class suburb now here's an interesting photograph you can see that curvaceous street and the street plantings that's going to develop into something that looks very similar to hamster garden suburb the idea of the curvy street rather than the grid pattern is to create aesthetic interest as you're moving around a circle or a rounded street you're always going to have a new vista opening up on you so it makes first suburb development in australia to have a cul-de-sac too so all sorts of planning innovations are included in this and there weren't front fences so it's an open civic space the other place that that was tried was canberra of course but if in your typical federation suburb and certainly at haberfield you've got picket fences at the front declaring that this is my front garden and out there is public space well in daceyville it blended all into one and the emphasis was on upkeeping the gardens and there were garden competitions and you could win as much as three pounds if you were the winner of the best garden which three pounds um was a week's wage at the time so not inconsiderable these are promotional photographs of of decibel you can see a pine tree possibly a norfolk island pine about to sprout up in the back garden they're still very young there was civic infrastructure too so here is the town hall community hall used for a while as a theater very typical of the architecture of the time you those turrets really beautiful probably a corrugated iron roof that may be asbestos that you can see on the the checkered wall with a brick lower half asbestos have been introduced into australia as in fibro just in 1911 just in time for this that was destroyed in 1985. that's right down at the beginning of the suburb on um on general bridges crescent and there are the the shops that were built to the suburb as well what we call new urbanism today which is an integrated um suburb or developments you've got shops and civic centers and parks and all the rest of it were implemented at this time in december so was really really interesting and extraordinary that the government would fund this as a model also for private enterprise and I've got a list of some of the people who took up their um those first leases on those shops there here's the first school a bit like a present-day demountable but by 1925 when desi garden suburb is called decibel there's the very substantial brick school again with a little still there there was a roman catholic school of similar dimensions that was built at the same time so it's a very anglo-celtic suburb I've got to I've got to emphasize that you know australia wasn't a multicultural place at this time very wide and that colours the way that the debate over daceyville um developed over the time it begins with a social reform agenda but as the war takes hold and fear of radicalism takes hold and particularly after 1917 and the the um revolution in russia you've you've got a um social reform is pushed to one side and um breeding good stout white citizens takes takes over as the the the agenda for for daisy bill so you've almost got a like a eugenics style of um narrative um overtaking the the the labor government which had initiated the plan is itself caught up in all sorts of internal bickering to do with conscription and holman who splits from the labor party in 1915 or 1916 becomes a premier um he leads a nationalist government which is far more here's a an interesting view of wark avenue which is not original well was in the original plan for daceyville that is not developed as um daceyville it's it's after building had closed off in the original part of that um little spiderweb design but you can see that the house is a very similar type of architecture um w h foggett was one of the architects sg thorpe won a competition also and the architecture is very much borrowed from vernon's palette which is again very much borrowed from the english revival so that is what's realized of daceyville at the time I i did lots of oral histories when I was writing my phd and several of the people I spoke to who grew up in baseball in the 1920s and 30s spoke about it being a defiantly working-class suburb despite what daisy wanted I spoke to some others who lived nearby in kensington and they looked at it as a very different place one woman actually thought it was um inspired by some sort of spanish architecture because they were archers which she took that to be a spanish style of architecture it was very different and it's interesting that children and they were children in the 1920s and 30s would have appreciated how different this space was to the grid street pattern of neighbouring um neighbouring kensington and there's daceyville today um those houses it's it's heritage listed and so the houses you can see there on the left are in original condition you can see the rough cast walls again absolutely straight out of the arts and crafts english revival palette um gardens no fences still some of them after the housing board uh was disbanded in 1924 again because of the war and because of the um the lack of interest in in labor reform and labor had lost power by then it was a nationalist party and some of the houses were sold off literally to freehold until you still see on the housing market and that photograph on the top right is a photograph of a daceyville house being sold on domain.com or something like that um but most of the suburb is and in the 1980s they consolidated the suburb and they built some extra houses and they tried to to build in a sympathetic style so the one you can see on the bottom right uses the same type of turret you can see on there we saw in the earlier photograph of the of the um theater as they refer to them as townhouses but they were built as late as 1988. um and it's really worth having a wander round it's like walking into another area it because there's such a uniformity to the housing style and the streets are so inviting it is a very different place and I i still recall my first experience of wandering around daceyville I felt like I was on a film set it didn't feel like your typical um sydney suburb where there's a mix of housing regardless of when the suburb was developed clearly in most suburbs there's been demolition and other flats built and whatever in daceyville it's pretty much as a in that original area it's pretty much as it was a social reform idea literally in in space and I think I've reached my 20 minutes so I'll leave it at that alice and then answer some questions if you have some
 hello basil community I'm your mayor bill sauronsky and on behalf of my councillors on bayside I'd like to say how great it is that we are finally on the road to recovery over the past few months we've pulled together as a community to overcome being a council of concern with some of the heaviest restrictions and now we'll pull together as a community to work towards rebuilding our future our communities everything at this time strong supportive community will get us back to doing all those things we enjoy your council has provided throughout these hard times by increasing grants to community organizations to help the neediest not charging interest on overdue rates waiving the fees usually charged with sporting fields and community halls waiver rental on all council owned commercial properties and much more this support will continue until the first december when all lockdown restrictions will be fully lifted by the state government across our community many organizations are working hard to reopen and today we're going to talk about a number of these organizations to find out how they to get business back to where it was pre-covered and the lockdowns and I can't stress enough how important it is we're all getting behind them and working together it's really important for baystock community to get together and work our local businesses and organizations in the heart of bayside so please where you can support them buy local shop local play local do your your business locally whatever you can do in the next coming months do it and be local we'll hear from the honourable chris mintz our state member from parliament and look at the opposition and local to baseline following a few words of why fellow counselors and kind of take this

toughest restrictions of any community in any part of the country during the pandemic their sacrifice was amazing and the impact on the economy has been extreme which makes me so angry that the new south wales government has excluded bayside council from the west invest funds these are funds that are meant to pick up communities in western sydney who've been hit hard by the closure and the lockdowns and the restrictions during the last 16 weeks we need those funds to lift our businesses up to make our communities whole we don't want one business lost or one job gone because people did the right thing and listened to their own government's health advice my name is michael naji and I'm the deputy mayor of bayside council there is no doubt that kobet 19 has impacted the wider community and the local businesses in the area there is no doubt that lockdown has been very tough for everyone especially the community and in more particular the local businesses a lot of the local businesses have struggled and some of mesa council has introduced a relief package to help the community and to help the local businesses and that's why it's very important to support each other especially in particular where the local business the local community can support the local businesses I strongly encourage bayside residents to go out there and and support local restaurants local businesses enjoy uh the days ahead as we have been struggling and been impacted by the lockdown that we've had in the last so many two and a half months I'm really pleased to announce that very soon

hello I'm councillor christina curry hi and I'm joseph banks park one of our favorite parks the covet lockdowns have only further highlighted the importance of our open green spaces they're crucial for our well-being to escape to your local park or nature setting is a really important thing to be able to do and we're really lucky here that bayside has a range of beautiful parklands wetlands sporting fields with a whole lot of opportunities for people to get out get some fresh air and do some physical activity which is really important for well-being the covered lockdown has further highlighted the importance of our open green spaces they are crucial for well-being council is supporting the well-being of our residents through enhancing our parks providing more playgrounds outdoor fitness equipment and off-leash areas this is really important for our community and we're so excited with what's planned so people can get out and enjoy their spaces the new design plan for the park is based on extensive community engagement there's over a thousand people who are involved in the design and it incorporates two different play zones of flying fox junior's got everything we're planning on having this up and running by april next year so we're really excited and this park has become so popular through covert with lots of people enjoying the spaces and the great upgrades that have been done here so as we open up we urge all residents to enjoy our wonderful open spaces like sir joseph banks park hi I'm councillor barlow I'm down here at our wonderful bayside garden centre I think if you haven't been here you need to visit it is the most wonderful adventure between the idf and council and we employ supported employees and qualified horticulturists so please come and visit at any time because it is now it's reopened it was closed for our best trading month in september so please come down and have a look around and I know you won't walk out without a plant I look I realise that covert has been difficult for everybody and some community members it's affected more than others but we need now that we've come out of lockdown I was in we were locked down I spent a lot of time in the garden and I actually dug up a third of the backyard to plant didn't grow any vegetables it's all flowers anything beautiful roses so it I know it's different for everyone but hopefully we're on the road to recovery and during covert I mean I think everyone was spending so much time at home and I had found I was cleaning up as well and found our old policy adopter tree so that um so that's now been a policies being upgraded at council and be presented to council hopefully before the end of this term and then the other one I kept asking was asked about was verge gardens that's has to be an upgraded policy as well but it's a matter of if you want a tree outside your house you can ring council you can ring me because we're very happy to increase the tree canopy of the whole city and we've been lucky to get um I think it's over a hundred canopy good luck to everyone out of lock down and hopefully this is the last time and look after yourselves and keep gardening hi I'm councillor dorothy rapisardi we're finally on the road to recovery following two very turbulent years the road to recovery looks promising and we're finally enjoying some freedom to move around

court or a golf game at botany golf course you can book any of the halls or fitness and recreation or any sporting facilities that we have via our website I am beyond excited about our new freedoms and cannot wait to have a bayside community back and alive again hi my name's james mcdonald I'm a councillor at bayside council and have been since 2008 I'm also I've lived in the area for nearly 40 years and I've been a business owner for over 20 years locally now being in business for nearly 20 years I haven't seen anything like this over the 20 years of running my own business small local business it has been very difficult but I can see the light and at the end of the tunnel which is very important being in small business I i I to help small business and they're doing a range of things uh including uh waiving fees for uh footpath training and dining this is to help cafes to to to start increasing their patronage again we're also waiving uh permit fees and construction sites and I think too one of the the great things that council's doing is also waiving fees for for da's residential da's under a hundred thousand so what that does that allows then the residents once their das are approved to go out and find local uh local builders local trades to assist in getting their business back on track as well so now we can see the light in the tunnel it's it's great to to get out there support local business local trades I think it's very important for our recovery there's some great businesses out there that are local and it's great to to support them our councils um their package is nearly over three and a half million dollars that they're supporting uh the local community it's a great incentive ward 5 which is uh the ward that I represent has some amazing um amazing cafes and restaurants along cook park great for walking great to grab that cup of coffee just even sometimes just a small purchase of a cup of coffee just helps our local our local businesses and helps them on the road to recovery hello everyone I'm councillor joe awada I'd like to thank the bayside community for the patience during lockdown well done everyone over the past few months I've been fortunate enough to enjoy daily walks along cook river and down to the foreshore of beautiful botany bay we are so blessed in bayside to have such a stunning open spaces within easy walking distance there are passive and active recreational areas for all to enjoy they contribute to our sense of well-being and they offer opportunities for everyone from competitive sport family picnics walking and cycling it's never been more important to look after our physical and mental health I'm here today at our foreshore where council annually delivers a summer for sure program to help maintain safe has expanded the program to include covert 19 safe summer initiatives such as additional ranges on for police patrol water police patrols and for sure ambassadors to provide public safety education and announcements monitor crowds and help keep us all safe as we move quickly towards opening our state I want to encourage our residents to enjoy our lovely beaches and parks and above all have a safe summer uh g'day my name is edward dougal I'm one of your local bayside councillors and I'm here today with fred from the bayside men's shed they're one of the great local organisations in our area and we're here today to talk about the impact code that 19's had on I had on the bayside med share so fred the bayside men's shed is obviously there to help people get through isolation look after their mental health you've been into lockdown out of lockdown back into lockdown um how has it's been for the menship yeah it's it's been a hard time for us particularly the members who have men's shed some of them spend all their all our opening hours here others of course only come once or twice a week and yeah with the with the interruptions you'll be working on a project and all the suddenly shut I mean you shut quickly it's here on monday on wednesday you're not here so what are some of the project your members are most excited about starting up again I know you do a lot for the community yep yep your neighbouring organisations well we had done we had projects going that we had to suspend in the breakdown we were doing um beehive native beehives for the b and b project so we had to sort of suspend that and we've started that back up again mostly I think they're excited just about coming back in and sitting around having a cup of tea that's what it's all about it's a chat um I think most of what most of them enjoy about the process problem solving somebody comes in with a problem and they all get to problem how do we make this how do we make that fit but here it's it's basically the sitting around the the chat about how you're going what you've been doing how you've been filling in the time yeah it's far more about the process the project yeah it's yeah it's more about the process and the projects yeah that'll be about right so has there been a big impact on your operations from covert have you had to adjust the way you work um the way people come in we've had probably the standard things that everybody's had to do we've put in a thermometer for people to check temperatures when they come in a hand sanitizer they're on entry now we're open again we do require double vaccination um everybody has to sign in so on every given day we know who who's here it's part of life that we've got to accept everywhere now it's the same when we go shopping or anything so um and if there was the men's shed right now what would it be we're here the message is that we're open we're open not only to members to come in but we're also open for the community to make use of us particularly other community groups we've done work for the girl guides and the local schools um and we look forward to doing those things from local kindergartens so yeah that's what we we want to get involved in you're raring to help yeah very raring to go fred thanks so much for your time I'd really encourage everyone to get down to the bayside men's shed it's a fantastic organization and I guarantee you'll have a great time well thanks for giving us the opportunity to put our case forward for what we do and and we increase our membership I'm here with paul taliana and great to have you here today paul and paul was the bayside sports person of the last year and paul began playing soccer with the pagewood botany football club and um what 50 parents and families are going to be looking for things for their children to do particularly you know for well-being and mental health and those sorts of things so for parents that are looking to get their their children involved what can page would offer we're going to have a four aside competition starting in the third of november and also that's from the age of five to the age of twelve and also what we'll

page absolutely email yeah email absolutely and any um parents that want to volunteer as managers or coaches the club's always looking for that real family club and um just to get together and um yeah have a enjoyable time for sure 100 my name's ed mcdougall I'm one of your local bayside councillors and I'm here today at barton park the site of one of council's most redevelopment of this park as a sporting and recreational hub incorporating new sports fields tennis and multi-purpose courts outdoor exercise stations a regional playground and walking and cycling trails barton park on the shores of the cooks river and with a front row view to the airport is going to become one of our area's most spectacular and valued green spaces as we open up I urge all of you to enjoy our precious open spaces like barton park today I'm here with bruce terry from the george football club and we're here to talk a bit about how their journey has been through cobed so bruce can you tell us a bit about how covert 19 has affected the club well it's obviously impacted on the ability for the club to finish the season um and we've had uh numerous uh occurrences where it's impacted financially on the club as well uh going into the new season with the lockdown very difficult to organize trial to organize grading uh very difficult for people to be in touch on a one-on-one basis and most always been one-on-one so with cove it's very difficult to go through that process and so we relied very much on social media and the website to contact people and to move forward for the new season obviously at the end of last season it happened so quickly that there was very little we could do but trying to stay in touch with the existing membership and coaches all that we took quite a bit of work on social media and through the website as I said so other than that uh we're looking forward to going forward it's going to be different because we've only just started uh putting the team together and hopefully from the first november uh 16 and over no jab no play we'll be going ahead uh with training so as we start opening back up again what are the club and your members most excited about I think the club and the members obviously the kids want to get back playing the coaches want to start implementing their programs we want to get out there and get everyone back's been struggled over the last few years so we're trying to implement some new programs and some new uh initiatives so now that you are opening back up what's the best way for people to get involved with the club well the best way is we're always looking for volunteers but also we've got people registering now we're just about full now with uh people registering which has been a fantastic uh result because of our constraints because of covert but we're always looking for people to come on board with their expertise voluntary of course to help us establish a club the club's a long uh historic club it was very successful in the old days so as you open back up what changes have you had to make to operate in a covered safe way well obviously the first thing is from we wouldn't be able to train until the first of november that's complying with the state government rules as they are today they do change regularly um but we're we've instituted a policy of including coaches uh and most of our coaches are definitely over 16 uh all have to have the job uh twice we've got a coated marshall we've got uh a qr code on the on the ground we're going to have qr codes at the training facilities well thanks so much for your time today bruce you do great work in the community I know community sports one of the things that people have missed the most during lockdown it's really affected people and their mental health missing out on their regular opportunity to get out and you know exercise and have fun with their with their friends and the community um so thank you very much and we look forward to this park becoming a premier hub for local community sport good on you thanks ed thank you I'm out at lestrange on this beautiful day with long-term president of mascot kings james so thanks for coming out today and um I guess it's been a challenging time for for everyone hasn't it and but particularly our youth with the inability to love coming down here and kicking a soccer ball so what do what have you found to be the challenges well obviously the stop start you know it started last season you know when we stop hot sudden hold to it and again this season yeah we thought okay we've seen the end of covert obviously really it's ugly ahead again and that that's the sad because kids were just starting to uh you know find their element and we actually grew as a club which was great um so that was one positive that came out of it but obviously the negative part was the stopping of it and kids missing out and you know as a community club we like to give back and we like we like to see kids you know keeping fit and active and not just the kids but the adults as well so yeah that was a bit of a dampener during this uh tough time yeah it's been hard but like like all clubs you've got a great volunteer base haven't_''_1572.559 you rely on like yourself's going to be really important for young people with mental health and wellbeing concerns so about getting them back playing into sport and as a community we're so lucky to have sporting clubs that that provide that so what are your plans to sort of get the kids back out on the field well now now it's coming into the new season so all the prepping starts now so it's you know we rely on our the two main social uh media pages your facebooks and your instagrams that we keep our members up to date with you know we push it out to our existing members to you know start looking about getting into our preparations for next season so the more we talk about the more excitement it generates so you know fingers crossed we've seen the last of covert and we started seeing the rainbow so hopefully we start seeing a lot more kids out and about so if parents want to get their kids involved the kids want to get involved what's the best way for them again you know facebook posts we we usually post on there about uh where how things are going and how when and best to uh contact us but you know any times of you know a good time to make contact with us and someone will get back to them straight away and congratulations to the club on you know coming up to 50 years that's an amazing achievement and all your volunteers and all the people that get involved we're as a community blessed to have um you know a club like yours and we look forward to the 50-year celebration where we are yeah it's actually we're in the planning stages at the moment to bring back yeah long-term people that were were involved in both the kingsford and the mascot club so you know preparations are happening there obviously some have departed um but we know that they'll be here in spirit yep and so yeah the prep rings are coming along slowly but surely we you know we'll have a big one next year or for everyone involved and you know we we culture race age we invite them to come down and be part of it because yeah even if you don't play the game you know it's a family environment here so whenever the canteens open we encourage people to come off the street and have uh buy a hot dog or something which is fundraising for them that's right it goes back into the club like I said no one gets paid here we we do it purely because we do it for the love of it and you know put a smile on someone's faces you know in these tough times it's uh it's a rewarding thing I will thank you for everything that you do and yeah it'd be great to see the

our new normal as it were um you know to be able for to re-engage with our community and to have our um our residents be able to get back out into the community we were very very cautious of their safety and of course of our staff's safety so it's exciting to be able to start rebuilding those safe and secure lives that we initially you know that's that's our mission that's the important work that we do cool and and closing was really not an option so there's no closure and grand re-opening like there is for a lot of our businesses there but what is that what how do what does that mean for the shelter yeah so of course we can't close and and um you know we are very very difficult for people suffering from domestic and family violence and so we've had to call on the supports of the community you know in terms of in kind donations and things like that so to be able to get out and actually say thank you in person is something I'm really looking forward to yeah so so with that you talked about the incline donations how can the bayside community get involved with the shelter what can the community do to help yeah so of course we what we're trying to do for our residents is um assist them in rebuilding these independent lives so that they're safe and secure and so we call on volunteers so the community can uh you know make contact with us and we can organise to sort of get their help in all of the different things that we need we need but also in terms of in-kind donations so non-perishable food we ask for we have wonderful support from all of our local mps in bayside area and they can deliver any non-perishable items we put how how can we set up our our residents when they're ready to move on into their new homes fantastic I'm sure the bayside community wants to get involved as much as they can as they learn about as they learn about the shelter so sally you've recently received a grant through bayside council what's that what have you done with that grant and what does that mean for the residents yeah so a wonderful opportunity um to be able to apply for the grant through bayside council um so what we did was we looked at what we needed in order to assist them in our case work support and what we really required was technical help so we use the grant for monitors for working so that we can keep our staff safely apart um and also some uh phone lines which are critical for uh you know the remote support so yeah a wonderful we're very lucky and very grateful uh so so the community is watching uh today what's the message for bayside how can they get involved how can about the shelter yeah thank you thanks um the bayside women's shelter our whole purpose and mission in life is to enable our residents and women who are escaping domestic and family violence to re-establish secure and safe lives rebuild independence and you know re-enter the community and that's what we work so hard to do we can only do that with the help of the community so I would I would you know I would love to see everyone come and join us and and uh join in the work that we're doing it's so so important yeah it's such a vital part of our community particularly postcode but everything is now lifting up but you know the bayside shelter still uh plays a vital part and forms a vital part of our of our community so um thank you very much for your time today and all the best for the future thank you just tell us a little bit about the bec and the work you do so what we what we do is um we help local businesses with their with are free some are

Thank you so much louise farrell I'm from the city projects team at council and we also have julie g online who's our senior project landscape architect and we've got a short presentation today to give you for the sir joseph banks adventure playground which is a very exciting project that we've been working on so just to give you a little bit of background in terms of the the joseph banks park playground we applied for state government funding for this play space of 2.5 million dollars through the public spaces legacy program and the idea is that we'll design and implement a regional play space in the adventure play natural setting it's anticipated that we'd be doing construction from next april with the project being completed by the end of the year so for those that you know um the area we have fremland street coming in an existing car park an existing playground which has a barbecue area and kids bike track and then the extension of the play space would be linking to that existing playground so in april able to have some face-to-face uh consultation in the park and we undertook um some workshops and have your say and the things that the community and everyone came back to us with was the top six items were that they'd like to see play spaces that are adventurous and fun a park celebrating nature something for everybody and elements of the history reflected in the sir joseph banks park that the play space is accessible and inclusive for all and that an overall improved amenity within the joseph banks park so for those of you that may not be that familiar the entry to the play space is the photo that you're seeing on the left of the screen and there's a small existing play area for under fives we have an existing play equipment with a sand play section and some playground equipment more climbing and and swinging for the over sixes and and these play spaces will be maintained it's more to um enhance and improve so you've got the barbecue shelter there on on the left and the footpath here will be installing uh some nature play in a flying fox in in this sort of zone but the main location of the new play space is on the the grass hill here which gives us a lot of ideas about how we can have you know adventure climbing up the hill and you know children getting to the top with their flag and sort of taking over the space and you know really being creative so it's a very large expansive space that we've got there to to implement a new playground so in terms of very high level planning the the pathway comes in and connects all the way around the the water's edge and you have the existing playground down in this right corner which we would do some enhancements and improvements and would maintain the existing bike track an existing barbecue shelter which was proven to be very popular then would install some low-lying sort of nature play through through this section and a double flying fox which children seem to find very very exciting and then you move through the space and we well as this very adventurous climbing up to the top of the hill to get to the the lookout point and um you know a bit of a highest point of the park where they can see everybody coming so in terms of some of the images that we've been looking at you know we know shade is very important picnic shelters and spaces for carers and parents to be a part of um natural landscaping with um you know timber sculptures and the use of sandstone and then some nice adventurous climbing areas um big slippery dips and slides and your climbing poles talking poles we've got down in the bottom corner here some sort of stepping stones in the natural environment to for children to be able to try out and be adventurous on them so just in a little bit more detail as I said you the arrival point into the existing play spaces along this this footpath here and we'll be trying to improve a lot of the existing equipment to have more an accessible element to them as some of the spaces to put in some connecting pathways and elements that are accessible for all children this zone here is almost like the quiet zone um a space where children can explore and come up with their own creativity some sculptures some lawn mounds and then the the flying fox been on this section with some seating areas around for for people to to watch on and also a shelter in this location um with additional seats as you move up into the the junior play space there'd be um climbing and traversing nets rollover bars for kids to practice their their dips and somersaults and things like that and then mounds to climb up and a smaller a slide section and then as we move into this um larger area here would be for the more senior equipment for for children so a much higher play tower that they can climb up a much bigger more adventurous slide some horizontal um poles to to play on and then this sort of rock escarpment that that they can explore but the the sort of pinnacle icon of the the playground I lookout and your children could use this as a bit of an adventure and take the off off track way up up the hill or they can follow the accessible path allowing for all carers mobilities to actually make their way up to this top lookout and it allows children to branch off into these sections where there might be balance beams or some seating off to the side different textures and different natural elements to really excite them and to allow that playful creativity to come out and then you know they make it up to the top and take over the lookout and you can look down to where their friends are making their way up as well we have very much tried to keep access paths in the area accessible so this purply pink line that you see across the area is where we're making accessible path connections throughout and then there's some bright yellow stars around to show where there's accessible play elements now there's accessible and non-accessible play elements as it's important to challenge children of all abilities and for so we saw the need for a lot of differing pieces of equipment and differing levels for the children to to climb through now being on a hill there is multiple levels for them to make their way through and also um this this large custom-made piece excuse me which would have a climbing area and then a a slide and lookout coming coming out of that space so we've just put together some concept sketches to show you the the sorts of things that we're trying to represent with the very natural elements that was a very strong feedback from the community in april and trying to put some elements of fun and adventure for children and the climbing areas and the towers

So um our presentation today and the story of east lakes reserve now called jack mundy reserve takes place on the lands of the gadigal and bidigal peoples of the eora nation it's a story of how residents with the support of unions stood up to the powerful wealthy developers and the politicians who supported them to save about four hectares of land as a park for the local people now if you're joining us from sydney um you've probably just come out of about three and a half months of lockdown and that has certainly given me a new appreciation of the importance of our local parks don't worry if you don't know who jack mundy is or you don't know what green bands are I will explain them later in my presentation so the story commences in 1961 when rosebury park racecourse was sold to developers for nearly 450 000 pounds which is about 13.3 million dollars in today's money this is a map from 1950 which shows the location of the racecourse now this is one side of a brochure and you can certainly see that it would have appealed to developers because the area is very flat it's cleared of vegetation and it's only four miles from the heart of sydney so when botany council or botany municipal council as it was known in 1961 re-zoned the race course for residential development it did reserve four acres or about seven percent of the 56 and a half acre site for parkland so this is a google map from 2020 with the with the site of the racecourse the original racecourse overlaid on the streets and just to help you orientate yourself this is southern cross drive around the right hand side of the map and you would go down this way towards the bottom of the map to go to the airport and you would go towards the top of the map to go to the city here's gardner's road up the top and then if you kept going to the left you would come to botany road so when park's development ironically parks park es development purchased the old race course they started 1500 low-cost residential units spread across 111 buildings no more than four stories high about 50 cottages and a shopping centre and to raise funds for the next stage of the development units were sold when the plans were approved by botany council and the units were built so they did it incrementally so this is um a 1963 plan which the developers submitted to botany council and it shows the existing green spaces which we've helpfully colored in in green for you here and there's a little one down here and another tiny one down here now there's two large vacant lots in the middle um and this one here on the left that's kind of an l shape was originally set aside for and I quote public garden and recreation space and the one on the right here became the shopping center so when people purchased the units as you can see them laid out on the streets here for east lakes they were told by the salesman that the redevelopment would include some parkland and some people paid more for the units which I'd really like you to think about and notice that l-shaped space and keep an eye on it and just to repeat this was a 1963 plan so now I'm showing you a 1964 plan um oops sorry about that getting too excited 1964 plan and you can see this l-shaped space now says future development stage two um now I don't know if this was ringing warning bells for um the people in botany council um when they saw these words future development stage two but it should have been beside it is the new shopping center here are some photographs from 1968 because parks development completed the lake's shopping center or the first iteration of it in 1964. and unlike shopping strips strung along major roads it had parking for 450 cars which allowed people to move between the shops while staying under cover you can still go to east lake shopping center today and it is like stepping back into a 1980s time warp and vanessa berry has illustrated this really well in her mirror sydney blog post um and I've provided slide okay so time passes another six years goes by and the unit blocks are built and here I'd just like you to look at this 1971 aerial photograph and pay particular attention to the different roof outlines of the buildings so you can really clearly say see that this is east lakes here where there's unit blocks and surrounding it are um cottages or um detached houses and you can you know definitely see the difference between the roof outlines of these places um here's the lake shopping center and here's our l-shaped space which our designer has helpfully colored in green for you you can also note over here some darker shadows which are being cast by the housing commission units these ones were designed by harry seidler on maloney street and these ones over here are on florence avenue so the housing commission units are um taller than the four three to four story east lakes units and the population density is much greater in those as well so in october 1971 residents who had purchased units from the developers overlooking what they crates of bricks being delivered to the only remaining open space in the area at that time the new east lakes residents contacted botany council to object to what appeared to be the upcoming disappearance of that promised parkland when they didn't get a satisfactory answer from the then botany council they held a public meeting on the 7th of november 1971 and that meeting they invited to that meeting jack mundy who was the secretary at the time and bob pringle who was the president of the new south wales builders laborers federation known as the blf so at this meeting the locals asked the blf to support their campaign to save their small green space in the heart of the estate the blf agreed and work stopped on the next set of housing units which were purported to cost about 1.5 million dollars now you might be wondering why would you invite the blf to a meeting to protect a park well the residents of east lakes were inspired and impressed by the success of the first green ban as it became known which stopped the development so kelly's bush is about 4.8 hectares of natural bushland at hunters hill on the northern side of the harbour and it was the focus of an unlikely alliance between the blf and the women that jack mundy dubbed the upper middle class morning tea matrons you can see here in this photograph jack mundy and eight of the 13 original women who battled to save kelly's bush at their 25th anniversary reunion um the green band was successful because um the blf um stopped not only construction at hunters hill kelly's bush but they said that they would cease assisting with construction of every av jennings project in sydney which was worth millions kelly's bush is still there today so now I'm showing you a 1973 plan which shows the relative population densities in eastlake's estate compared to neighbouring areas so this um black outline here is where the east lakes development is and if you can see the tiny writing it says that the density of that population is 69 people per acre and if you were to look to the left is only 30 people per acre and below that only 20 people per acre now that density in east lakes is not including the people who reside in the housing commission units and if you were to include those people if I've done my maths correctly the density will come up to 92 people per acre and then you can see that there's very little green space in the area because it's also telling you um how much the parks per people is per acre so this was one of the planning documents that botany council and the state government were taking into consideration when they were thinking about approvals for the east lakes development now you may not be surprised to learn that jack mundy found it much easier to convince the blf that they should support a building ban at east lakes than hunters hill because the people of east lakes were less affluent than those at hunters hill the residents of eastlakes also felt that they'd been duped by the developers as many of them had paid extra for units overlooking the promised board and this is the proposal that they came up with in 1973. they've presented this plan to botany council and you can see that our l-shaped parkland is their extent but surrounding it is eight no sorry four eight story residential towers and that's the shopping center um botany council of um those eight those four residential towers would hold 176 units and this is what the developer wanted in compensation for giving up what they or what they saw as giving up lot 6 for parkland um so this design was submitted as I said to the then botany council and they voted unanimously to accept the proposal and council told the local residents that they should support it as it was quote the best deal they could get the local residents met with members of the blf on lot six on this piece of ground and they decided sorry that the price of the puck was too high so the blf um led by the people decided to extend their ban on all building work on the east lakes site in 1973. and so you know con significant complex negotiations between four four groups parks development the botany council the minister for local government in the new south wales state government who had oversight of all local developments residents and the blf and I'd just like you to note that in 1973 these are still referred to as black bands and a black band was originally a tactic that the unions would use to um lobby for better pay or better conditions for their workers this is a 1971 cartoon by bruce petty and I'll just break it down a little bit for you um it shows an overbearing real estate developer with plans in his back pocket at the wheel of the bulldozer the bulldozer belongs to the developers and the friends um so the wheel is connected to the head of pat morton who is the new south wales minister for local government and highways as he was then and so this is implying that it's really the developers or the capitalist developers who are driving the state um this little person in the front holding the gear lever askin sir robert askin sorry who was the new south wales liberal premier at the time and over to the right you've got the big hairy forearm of the builders labourers federation which is trying to stop the bulldozer which is coming in to crush the rocks kelly's bush and east lakes eventually in september 1974 all parties agreed that parks development could build just two residential blocks with 24 units each so a total of 48 units not the 176 units they had originally sought in addition to that parks development agreed to transfer land for a park to botany council and pay five thousand dollars for landscaping this deal which the blf helped the people to negotiate was I think much better than the one that the botany council was prepared to accept from developers so as joe owens said too many people have regarded their position in life as immutable then came our green bands and now they realize they can fight the developers and all the other exploiters so the blf really helped to strengthen the voices of local residents who wanted to save when there was a ground swell of local support for the green bands or for for that action so this is an article from the sun newspaper from 1973 and you can see that the language has changed and they're now being called green bands um so by november 1973 there were 33 green bands imposed by the builders labourers federation in new south wales about 27 of them were in the sydney area and if you're looking closely at the map you can see that actually number two is up here on the rocks and number three is down here at these lakes um I've been saying that east lakes was the second green ban in history both the rocks and east lakes commenced in november 1971 the east lakes won on the 7th of november um and I'm saying it's the second that eastlakes is the second one because meredith and verity bergman in their book green bands red union the saving of a city say that eastlakes was the second one so I'm going to go with their chronology um this an image of jack mundy overlaid with that article from the sun newspaper which I just showed to you before showing um who was responsible or who was at the helm leading the green bands movement in the night early 1970s and so as jack mundy said when we called them green bands instead of black bands it had a more noble argument because we weren't just trying to increase the wages and conditions of the workers we were looking on a wider angle at the quality of life issues so on the 13th of august 2021 this year um this parkland officially was renamed the jack mundy reserve to commemorate the role of the blf and the green bands in saving this recreational space for the residents of east lakes now I think that bayside council possibly took a risk in renaming the park because it had been known as east lakes reserve for over 50 years but I think that the renaming shows us that even though there were times in the early 1970s when the then botany council did not always agree with the residents of wants to recognise the significant role that mundy and the blf played in saving this park for the local people so even organizations like local councils can change and evolve so as well as putting up this sign with the new name um is uh bayside council has installed an interpretive plaque which explains for people about that some of the history in the background to the renaming and who jack mundy was I think it's you know really good that um bayside council is recognizing this history um the east lakes green ban is not very well known um and this is primarily because it was achieved the successful outcome was achieved through patient and persistent negotiations rather than through violent protests or scab labour or clashes with police which tend to bring the media attention to to the other green bands that you might have heard of before so who is jack mundy he was born in 1929 in the atherton tablelands in north queensland and he left school at the age of 14 to work as a labourer and to play rugby league football rugby took working on large building sites in the 1950s mundy described the working as a builders labourer as the most menial the most arduous the most dangerous work by far he was shocked by the working conditions and pay on building sites in sydney and joined the union movement rising through the ranks to become secretary of the builders labourers federation in new south wales in 1967. sorry I've just lost my mouse now while it may not be everybody's dream to be immortalized on a tea towel I think jack mundy would have been proud to be depicted on this everyday object this design shows a youthful jack mundy down the bottom and a older jack mundy up the top who instead of keeping his cards close to his chest wears them proudly on his chest um it's hard for you to see the detail in this tea towel but it will be on display in the mascot library soon and you'll be able to see that eastlakes is written in in in the design of the tea towel he's called jack of spades and of heritage buildings as well as the natural environment and was chair of the historic houses trust of new south wales from 1995 to 2001 and subsequently patron of the historic houses friends group now the green bands actually had an international significance as well because according to former australian senator bob brown the greens political party derives its name from the green bands and this is because when petra kelly a german activist visited sydney and jack mundy in 1977 she witnessed this successful social movement that was the green bands and adopted the green name for the pro-environment party in germany and this in the end spawned a new international worldwide political movement so both the trades hall now known as unions new south wales and cross art in paddington have recently had exhibitions about jack mundy and the green bands um however because the east lakes green band did not have the high profile of those at the rocks ortoria street or king's cross or the opera house or kelly's bush it's often overlooked in the history of sydney's green bands um I collection at bayside council libraries um this presentation would not be possible all the plans and documents that I've shown you from the beginning and additional ones which are included in the exhibition um would not be here if it were not for the collection at bayside council and that would mean that this history about east lakes and east lakes reserve and the park and jack mundy's involvement would be far less knowable and less discoverable so bayside council is hosting a social history exhibition about east lakes and the green bands over the summer you'll be able to see more of the original documents like those I've shown you today and thanks to our collaboration with the trades hall council and crossout we will be able to show you some further information and memorabilia about jack mundy and the other green bands that have saved parks and heritage sites from poor planning and urban development I do hope you can come and see the exhibition at mascot library when the library reopens and at this stage the exhibition will be on until the end any questions that you might have

Um hi guys uh my name is haley I am also on gadigal country today slightly different place and I would like to pay my respects to elders present and emerging and any um aboriginal or torres strait islander people who may be here today so we we're looking at waste in bay's side so I'm from keep australia beautiful we do a lot of work with bayside in um education in primary schools if you've had kids doing environmental that's us uh you guys also won a tidy not tidy town sustainable cities award with us as well so you're doing some great things and we just want to run through waste and recycling services in bayside so you're probably familiar with bins you might have the red bin yellow bin and green bin you may not have a green bin it depends where you live and the reason we have these different bins I'll just start off with the waste hierarchy um is to the waste hierarchy is sort of levels of what we should be doing with our waste you know choosing to buy you know things like apples for snacks instead of muesli bars or something like that so you don't have all those little plastic packaging it's choosing to um you know when you go to the supermarket don't put all your fruit and veggies in plastic bags you can use your own reusing waste is something like you know if you have a glass jar you have peanut butter in it you wash it out and you reuse it for other things recycling is lower than that because that same glass jar for example to be recycled has to go through a whole process it has to go through your bin it has to be sorted out it then has to be crushed down and melted and transformed with thousands of other glass jars and things like that glass things like that into new objects so there's a lot of energy involved in recycling recovering energy we don't really do in um domestic services okay so that's you know old batteries and things or recovering energy um to be used treating waste is treating chemical and wastes that can't_''_158.08 be used again and disposing of waste down the very bottom that's landfill so that's your red bin just disposing of it now a landfill a lot of people have this idea of a landfill like they used to be um dumps okay they're not dumps it's not this great big mound full of garbage it's not an open face full of garbage um there aren't like lots of you know birds and rats and things swarming around it's very warm and I get your button so a landfill this is um not uh the woodlawn land tool but this is a really good example of landfills that we use in australia we call them sanitary landfills most of the time so they are really well constructed engineered um pieces of land is that hole in the ground they have to assess the size is it too close to waterways is the um you know the different clay levels and things underneath the ground are they any good is this a good site too high for the for the landfill to be here um and then yeah they do dig a great big hole and they do line it with a few different linings usually there's a synthetic liner and some um clay lining as well and they're huge they are really huge I don't know if you can see the little trucks in there they're really big areas of land okay a lot of people have this idea as well that you can just sort of put your organic scraps in there and they're gonna rot anyway right it's not like that so a landfill is not a compost because you're burying these things underneath the ground they're being covered every single day they're decomposing in what we call an anaerobic environment right so you might have heard the word aerobic with air anaerobic is the opposite and because they're rotting in this anaerobic environment they're producing methane and this is why landfills are one of the greatest sources of methane um not like for the land that they're on methane and use it to generate electricity um if they can't do that sometimes they do burn the methane to split it into co2 and I think h2o but still greenhouse gases but methane is about 20 times worse than co2 so we really don't want it there when you're composting things and things in your green bean for example if you compost and mulch those um they're treated very differently and we'll talk a little bit about that later uh they are composted with air they're chopped up um we use lovely microbes to get in there and decompose it in a more natural way um unfortunately australia is really dependent on landfills we are only very not too recently but it's still we're not quite as good as some european countries for example better than others um but we still have this huge reliance on landfill just for getting rid of our waste um and most waste that isn't recycled by the consumer that's us ends up in landfill this is another way of looking at our landfill this up um just for a minute for you to have a look at uh you have to be aware as well sorry I live under a flight path you might be able to hear that airplane if you've ever left garbage you know in the bin for a while and you've lifted it out and there's all of that you know liquidy gooey stuff in there that happens in a landfill as well on a much much larger scale it can also include sort of nasty chemicals too um and we call that leachate and that does need to be pumped up so there'll be a pumping system the leachate collector uh collection sump and we'll bring that up to treat that now things like batteries people put their little batteries into their red bin that's a big no-no so your batteries any sort of battery doesn't go in any of the bins at home you need to take that away to like aldI's have their battery collection and bayside city council has various collection points as well a general rule centers and we do that because we don't want a we can recycle and recover a bit of energy from those um and b we don't want the chemicals in the landfill leeching down and potentially getting into our land all right we talked a bit about the methane production so these are the methane sort of capture pumps here that's my dog oh there you go I underestimated it methane is 28 to 36 times more effective than co2 at tracking heat and as I said we can capture some of that and create energy but we also do burn a lot of it just to split it off and that is as I said before from those things rotting underneath the ground or that organic material in an anaerobic environment I got really excited didn't I explained all of this in the last couple of pictures all right now the leachate as we do pump it out we do have to remember that landfills while we're pretty good at them in australia we're pretty good at sealing that off um we don of things can get into the local land and water it doesn't happen very often in australia but of course you have to remember that this leak shape just doesn't go away we can pump it up and treat it but we still have to store it somewhere if it's poisonous all right now most household wastes and this says preschool and childcare stay with schools uh that we produce looking at the graph from 2016 to 2019 not much difference um it's organic so if you go to the epa website you can see um waste by industry or by area um you can see what sorts of waste types we produce plastics is always very small because it's generally uh as you can see um on the side it's measured in weights and plastics like uh much much lighter than anything else when we do a um a waste ordered at a school we always count the pieces of plastic with the school so waste order is when we tip out all the bins and we see what's inside we always to compare because it's very deceiving to see that we don't have that much plastic by weight but when you go and count all of these pieces of plastics you'll see that we have many many many um individual pieces going to landfill and it is by item a lot bigger than by weight paper and cardboards while we can recycle a lot of that a lot of it does end up in landfill as well unfortunately all right so our main um goal in waste uh in keep australia beautiful for councils is diverting waste away from landfill so you probably heard the three r's reduce reuse recycle that's a simplified version of the waste hierarchy um and this has a great I should have mentioned as well economic impact landfill is really expensive all right so your red bin your garbage bin now you can put organic material like orange um eggshells and things like that in there a better option a bigger pattern is to wait um use a worm farm or compost if you can there are also apps out there actually sort of search people who will take organic waste for their compost or you could be someone who will take other people's organic waste for your compost it's a really good way of sharing there also so many resources on the love food hate waste website so that's new south wales government website to reduce the organic matter going to landfill if you just can't_''_763.279 um compost or use a worm farm now your broken plates can go in there if you have a rat problem and you find a dead rat outside that can go in the red bin too the plastic bags this is the only bin you could put plastic bags in um nappies sanitary products broken plates light globes don't go in the yellow recycling bin there will be some drop off points for different types of light glows but you have to look into that broken glass as well like your broken um wine glasses or vases things like that they have to go into the red bin they're made out of something different to glass bottles and if you break your plates and your crockery they go in there as well alrighty now we do try not to put the garden organics into your red bin because if you have a green bin because that's a way of diverting from landfill we want to mulch and compost those garden organics now you can't necessarily put I know some councils you would have seen have bogo food and organic so it's food organics garden organics that's what fogo stands for and they have bins where you can put your food scraps in there uh if it's just a green organic spin like it is in bayside at the moment it's just garden organics because it's a different composting system okay there are different types of composting systems all right so a lot of bayside and look a lot of council areas after the amalgamation of council areas the the old council areas still had their um waste services in contracts for 10 or 20 years so you might find parts of bayside are different to other parts of bayside but for to it first it goes out near well I've forgotten the name now but it's a place in sydney it's called a transfer station it's sorted out a little bit and then it gets taken out to woodlawn which is down near goulburn okay tarago is down near goldman I'll give you sorry I'll give you a second to look at that it's pretty interesting I think so when a landfill is um all full they do cover it up and they will turn it into you know if it's suitable it can be a park it can be housing even um sydney park if if you ever come into sydney you know now that we're allowed to again uh that was the landfill site it was clay works the landfill site now it's a park and it has a pretty great um stormwater filtration system as well now contamination is when you put the wrong things like in this picture into the wrong bins so incorrect items especially into the yellow recycling bin and the green bin um and and this is part of the reason that we had trouble with the recycling with china because the recycling we were sending over was such poor quality recycling so it's really important that we only put the right things in the yellow bin the recycling bin and the green bin because if you put like a pue nappy in your um yellow bin it gets all over some cardboard things like that they don't clean it they can't clean it it gets sent to landfill it's a huge waste of resources all right so in our recycling bin so I have another lovely slide to explain this but usually as I teach kids we have five groups of things and you can use your hand to remember we have paper and cardboard paper uh cardboard rather it's just really thick paper uh cartons so like those milk cartons now they might have the owl foil on the inside if they're a long life carton and they have that layer of plastic as well uh cans so your aluminium and your uh steel cans so you have clean alfoil you can keep it um I have like a little shelf where I keep all the clean alfoil like from easter and you keep it until you have enough to scrunch up into a ball about the size of your fist and then you can recycle that and that is because it's not heavy enough as a sheet it would be assorted out with paper but as a fist it's heavy enough to be picked up at the recycling center by what we call eddies which are electrocurrent magnets all right I think I'm needing to go a little bit faster glass just glass jars and bottles they can go in and our plastics now it's hard plastic so hard plastic bottles um peanut butter containers those sorts of things they should all be as empty as possible uh if we're not in a massive drought as well giving them a little rinse really helps too all righty now as I was sort of covering there our recycling at home system is made for containers for food containers uh mostly drink empty laundry bottles they can go in there with the glass jars and bottles as I said before it's not made for broken like glassware not that that's gloss um it's made for jars and bottles different kind of glass melts at different temperatures that's why they have to be sorted out differently all right this is not going to play is it yeah now this is not um face side obviously but just to let you know that all your recycling ending up so these five groups paper and cardboard cartons plastics glass and cans they all get dumped out together and they go through series of machines to be sorted out into different types these types then gets or categories whatever you want to call them they then get bailed up just like a hay bale or a wool bell they get squashed together or they get put in containers to be taken elsewhere now this is another area where if we haven't put the right things in a lot of contamination can occur and things do need to go to landfill unfortunately play this whole thing you can google all of these sorts of things just to let you know um all of these items go through the murf the materials recovery facility and they get sorted out on these conveyor belts going around and around in different ways until we have products that we can send off for recycling so the actual recycling generally happens overseas it doesn't always happen in australia unfortunately we don't have a huge industry for that all right hopefully we do something at some stage so green bin stuff from the garden or if you have flowers inside you can put that in there as well not for big logs or anything like that little little twigs um mulch weeds grass clippings leaves as I said before these get taken away for mulching composting sometimes this stuff is used to fill in old mine sites if it's really high quality stuff in some areas I don't think this happens in bayside but I know in goulburn for example they can sell compost back to residents at a really reduced price and it go organic fertilizer now huge way of saving organic matter from atlanta I love the green all right so there's other things like your batteries like I said that can't go in any bins mobile phones electronics there's alternative recycling management alternative um waste management services and this is what we call at source separation so return and earn is great uh not only you get your money back but you also are separating those materials at source so there's much less chance of contamination uh mobile master with the phones I'm sure you've all heard of that terracycle are a great organization they recycle so many weird tricky little things that we can't do at home uh you do have to pay for some of these services some of them are free uh like mobile master for example and returning you get money from that all right so I am done with my bit
 okay welcome everyone I think now we've got some people coming in uh so good evening everyone my name is uh councillor jason mcdonald I'm the deputy mayor of bayside council and I'm your mc for this evening welcome to our virtual town hall forum I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of australia and recognize their continued continuing connection the land water and culture I'm currently on the land of the gadigal and physical digital people of the inauguration and pay my respects to their eldest past present and emerging it's great to see so many people joining us online for this very important conversation about social and emotional well-being tonight we are joined by the mayor of bayside council joe wada the general manager of bayside council meredith wallace angela crowe from georgia sutherland mental health service south eastern sydney local health kate milhot and miffy key from south eastern community connect and mona luxton from bay city care this evening we'll hear from each of our guest speakers followed by a question and answer session mayor joe hear from angela crowe on so and emotional wellbeing kate milhot and miffy kern key and mona luxton will then outline their projects with a focus on community support and then finally the general manager uh meredith wallace will talk about what council is doing we'll then open the forum for the q a session many of you have already submitted questions online but there is also an opportunity for you to ask questions by the chat during the session which will go directly to the host we will answer as many questions as possible in the a lot of time however please include your email address as you raise a question online so we can come back to you um if it needs more a more detailed response these are challenging times it's natural to experience feelings of uncertainty and anxiety right now living in lockdown is tough and we'll be discussing things this evening that may be upsetting so please um you can talk to somebody in support is available you can call lifeline on 13 11 14 any time or meant though the mental joining us this evening it gives me great pleasure to now introduce the mayor of bayside council councillor joel water uh thank you thank you uh councilman donald good evening everybody I'd like to also start by acknowledging the traditional custodian of the land we know as bayside council local government area and on which this online meeting is being held and I pay my respect to elders past present and emerging from the gadigal ambitious clans of the urination uh thank you for joining us this evening for this very important conversation around how we are all coping with the current restrictions and how and where we could get help if we need to the restrictions in the bay side lga got a little harder since our last forum we now have a nightly curfew from 9 pm to 5 am exercise is limited to one hour per day and no recreational activities allowed we understand the new rules are designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus so less contact we have with people from outside our home the less likely we are to catch the virus roof over our head and food on on the table mentally living with covet also got a little harder so tonight's forum topics are very important conversation to have because fortunately we live in a community where no one should feel that they are alone or have nowhere to turn to in difficult times I guess people from all backgrounds will begin to struggle in the coming weeks ahead and my message to everyone this evening is that we are here for you and please if you are struggling in any way mentally physically financially please reach out asking for help is a sign of true strength and let's face it it takes courage you will not be judged and you will be supported I guess everyone knows these are unprecedented times we will be tested I look around my own family we are blessed with so much but still there are times when we when it gets tough to stay home day in day out to follow the rules I think it's easier for someone my age I have my own routine and find that it come home and get ready for work I guess go for a walk and then come home and get ready for work even though my office is now just down the hallway as a family my wife and children began organizing friday night dinners over zoom it takes a little getting used to but now it's just what we do and something we all look forward to it was a little awkward at first we were all talking at once eager to catch up with each other but now we're all more relaxed and really enjoy this time together talking over dinner like we would normally do but obviously a little bit different under the circumstances I think it's much harder for our teenagers and those with young families especially those having to home school or those of in our community who have lost their job and their regular income technology has made it easier for us to stay connected but it can also make it harder when you can only see and hear your grandparents your parents your children or dearest friends on a screen it say this every time we talk to people and around the place but we are a resilient nation we are tough we are all stronger than we think but no one has to go through this alone we have some great guests this evening and I thank them for coming along and sharing with us the types of services that are readily available and waiting so as I said at the start it does take courage to reach out but if you do please know there will always be a strong hand to help you and thank you for listening thank you mr mayor for those very supporting and encouraging words and yes it does um communication now with all the technology we have does make it a lot easier I now invite um angela crowe from st george and sutherland mental health service service the south eastern sydney local health to talk about coping strategies and how we can improve our social and emotional well-being thank you thank you very much deputy mayor and mayor um owada I also would like to acknowledge the um traditional owners of the don't know if you can hear about instant peter's I've got an airplane heading over at the moment so I'm on the gadagaland but uh yes the same as bayside being gateable and vigil and I acknowledge that underneath the asheville and concrete like the traditional lands and that land was never seated um so thank you for that introduction yes I'm an occupational therapist and I work at the st george and sutherland community mental health service as a community development quarter with coordinator which means that I support community organizations and services and also people who live in the community with mental health distress um to have more awareness around how to support themselves and how to support others if they're feeling distressed in their mental wellbeing I also work at the acute care team at st george mental health uh so my role there is responding to people who in it are in acute mental distress and crisis and supporting them to get to the next step um so I'm delighted to be here today and I also do just is under at the moment uh with covert 19 and I'm just going to click over so without laboring too much because there's plenty of this information in the news um we know that this is unprecedented the times that we're living in at the moment and we know that covert is an ongoing threat to our health and safety that we're experiencing challenging lockdowns that people are having job losses um there is financial strain across many people uh in the bayside area and we're all impacted by isolation as well too so our covert sprint it seemed when we were doing so well has unexpectedly become a marathon and many are grappling I guess with the physical the psychological um and the social uh and financial impacts of what covert has has brought so we're adjusting rapidly and um the adjustments that we've had to do have been really unprecedented at this time so I guess I'm here to talk about what we can do to help get through this marathon before we kind of go through that I need a brilliant psychologist who in 1943 um identified that everybody regardless of their background or who they were have basic human needs so all humans experience these needs that are listed here so the bottom two are very much about basic needs so what are the fundamental needs that we need in order to survive and to live and so here we have things like we need access to food to water to air we need to be able to get good sleep we need to have shelter and also we need to have freedom from fear and have safety um then we have psychological needs uh in the middle which are really about things such as being able to have friendships or feel connected to other people to have a sense of belonging with our community and also to have independence and the ability to have achievements and develop mastery over things and then the very top needs are about um things that help with self-fulfillment so things that help us have a sense of achievement and the pandemic has significantly affected this these things so the impact on lot of us have worries about how to access our basic needs um we feel disconnected from other people and we can't do those things that are important to us and give us that sense of fulfillment in our life and so um it really is about trying to focus on on getting supports around those basic experiences that that we um need in order to survive so a few here these are like the really fundamental things so obviously drinking water um making sure that you are drinking enough and not drinking uh too much alcohol or like really trying to curb that if you can and if because we're all in must at the moment making sure that we're well hydrated in order to get through this marathon is really important um I don't know if you're like me but I have a strong desire to want to comfort eat my way through the lockdown period but 10 weeks in and we can't continue to do that so making sure that where possible you are trying to sustain your body to get is really helpful um it says working out but that can be anything it can be things like um just getting getting some exercise going for a walk doing some chair-based exercise if you have physical mobility issues um that our bodies were made to be used uh so that we can sustain them and so that we can fulfill their need as well too so working out is really important um if you are someone who um likes to have an intense workout you might use your exercise hour all at once or you might decide to break it up throughout the day and sleeping well often when we have mental well-being challenges where we feel really anxious our sleep is the first thing to get interrupted and it may look like sleeping too much it may look like sleeping too less or it might also just be a sense of apathy as well too throughout the day but having really good sleep um and developing good routines and habits around that is really important oops oops sorry sorry about that okay so I mean obviously getting access to had job losses or experiencing financial strain um you may actually need to ask for help right from the very beginning and so there's been a number of supports laid out by both um federal state and local government um to get access to some of those supports so whether it's about um you know financial support I'm I'm thrilled that we've got some services here tonight which will be able to tell you about how to get access to some other basic needs as well too particularly around financial assistance or food assistance and so uh asking for help does actually help make you stronger to help get you through this marathon that we're experiencing at the moment and it's not a sign of weakness maintaining connections any way we can really really important and there's a few suggestions here about how to maintain connections um so there's been a bit of a puppy boom you've all people who have pets getting out and going for a walk with your pet um you know waving to other people who out with their pets on the other side of the street all masked up is a good way to still be able to have some interaction or if you are lucky enough to have neighbours that you get along well with being able to chat with them um you know over the fence or if you are in a unit block um you know across the hallway in your own house massed up it's still a way to be able to connect with others um obviously down the bottom we've got things like zoom or other apps that can be used if you're someone who's lucky to know how to use it and and facilitate social connections through social media these are really excellent ways to develop those connections and there's a photo there of spoonville as well too so although we can't connect in person spoonville international which is quite fun to look up um is a way where people might make a creative likeness of themselves and and then congregate them in a place in the community to be able to connect ways of being able to to connect and I would definitely encourage you to do that one of the things I do um with my walks is that I might call a friend while I'm going for my walk and they go on their walk and I go online but physically not together we are in two separate suburbs when we do that and we have a virtual walk together um so that's another really easy way to be able to connect with others as well I'm delighted that anybody who's attending today and what is going to be available afterwards on the bayside website uh a number of um different resources in um some state home packs which have been developed by the st george community mental health team and uh they include a whole heap of stress busting and distraction activities um and there's a few different suggestions here um that you can even look up they're all publicly publicly accessible things like puzzles sudoku caliber number activities that you can do like a scavenger hunt or things to look for when different different suggestions around um fitness activities that you can do mindfulness apps that you can do and mindful coloring as well so looking for those things to do at home is has become really important create a list of things you would like to to tick off or achieve when you're in lockdown if you've been meaning to you know patch the the roof to get rid of that that spot now's a good time to do it or any other little activities that you can have um when you um also uh uh really good excellent branding techniques that you can do uh are using your senses so one of the things that anxiety or that when we're challenging um challenged in our well-being is actually to um maintaining ourselves in the present and so it we can think about the past and we can worry about the future and sometimes that can make people really um uh anxious and distressed as well too so a very quick grounding technique is to use your senses and you can do this when you're cooking are driving um when you are going for your walk or when you're just sitting quietly and it is to name five things that you can see four things that you can hear three things that you can touch two things that you can smell and one thing that you can taste to help you to just become more aware about your present situation and your present kind of physical environment and help you to think about those things or strengths that you might have or that you can draw upon at that time so that's a really quick grounding technique which is available for um for anybody to be able to do if you speak another language there's lots of resources available uh out out on the uh on the interweb uh so wayahead.org is a mental health information service for new south wales and they have a lot of translated fact sheets around mental health well-being for a number of different cultural languages and also the new south wales multicultural health service have a lot of resources available um below I have a couple of languages so tide is a mandarin language mindfulness meditation app and also talison is an arabic language uh mindfulness or meditation app and they're both really um really easy to download uh in your app store obviously you do need a mobile phone or a smartphone to be able to access those if you need immediate help for mental distress so if you are at that point where um you're really struggling and you need to ask somebody for advice or speak to somebody the numbers that have been provided tonight are the mental health line which is the line for new south wales public mental health services where I'm from and that number is 1-800 and it's 24 hours uh or if you're needing to connect with someone and have a chat with them um lifeline is generalist counseling service as well and they will also refer you to other services or or direct you to other services if you need a bit more support um they are also 24 hours um some people do and will have thoughts of suicide and the suicide that instance or one eight hundred um oh one one five one one the mental health line and that um really needs to be called if you feel like there is um you're at the end of the line and you needing to get some support around that um do call that number uh kids helpline as well has a lot of great resources there for parents and also for kids if they're feeling particularly anxious or if they've got some other kind of distress have a look at the kids helpline website or give them a call that's an excellent service in an emergency please call triple zero um but there's those other numbers that I would call first so I only use triple zero in the case of an emergency lastly I just want to reiterate that obviously we are in a marathon and we're right in the middle of it at the moment and that things are changing rapidly but hopefully there's some light at the end of the tunnel as vaccination numbers go up and I do want to we will get through this um so hang in there try and implement some of those strategies and uh thanks for having me today thank you angela you outlined some great um strategies and I'm sure the guests this evening will find them very helpful and I did notice the the questions that were coming up um I noticed that they were they were very happy and they they were getting that information which is great great um I just also want to assure everyone that there's plenty of time for questions and answers um for more questions um after we have speakers talk so our next speaker I'd like to introduce kate milhop the ceo of south eastern community to connect to talk to us about their organization and then I'm going to ask mickey um currently to talk about the people's pantry and the great work they are doing in our community thank you thank you deputy mayor before I begin I too would like to respectfully acknowledge the past and present traditional owners on the lands in which we meet it is euro nation I would also like to say thank you to bayside council for organising this evening's event and for all the community members for your attendance tonight my name is kate malhot I'm ceo of south eastern community connect otherwise known as sec we're a not-for-profit community organisation that has been operating in the community for 44 years and our aim is through our services and programs to foster independence belonging and well-being within the community our services operate across the span they range from parenting programs and play groups through to our age services all of our age services are currently continuing to operate during the restrictions as we are deemed essential workers currently we continue to provide our list shopping service our fruit and vegetable delivery service our respite which provides a break for carers and our community transport where we're helping seniors to attend medical appointments all staffed are required to wear masks and it and to maintain social distancing at all times and during their restrictions one of the conditions that's been placed on them now is that they're regular well-being conversation and checks with our seniors and for those seniors that we've identified who are that much more vulnerable um those who are particularly the extroverts of the group we've arranged for our volunteers to ring up on a regular basis outside of our usual work hours so this occurs during the evenings and at weekends our service children are also maintaining contact with seniors they've been writing letters to them drawing cards and we've been handing them out to our seniors when we're delivering their uh groceries to them this has been a really big hit with our seniors with one of them saying to us it was better than receiving a bunch of flowers memphis going to talk to you about what's been happening at the hub however I'd like to let everyone know that we've still got some outreach services operating at the hub kingsford legal centre otherwise known as klc is continuing to provide legal support and advice this is being done over the phone and we now have tax help operating for those who need help please we've got our contact details behind us reach out to us and we will be able to help you in any way possible lastly I'd like to say that we've been taking photos of the talk messages as we go for walks around the streets of um bayside and particularly east lakes where we're based and the the chalk messages have been absolutely fantastic and they've been images that say like hang in there so we've done a youtube video outlining the messages that we've received and we just would like to extend an invite to the rest of the community if you'd like to put a message out there we're happy to upload it to our youtube video to maintain the wider connection with our community so now I'm going to hand over to myth and she's going to talk to you about some of the services that are operational at the hub good evening everybody as kate's introduced me my name is mafanwie kirke and I'm a very proud member of southeastern community with you just one of our community projects that operates out of our community hub in mascot now if you're not familiar with the hub I'll start by saying that ordinarily when we're open our conversation and services engage with a cup of tea and even though we can't do that any at the moment with covert restrictions one thing that everybody's saying is that help is only a phone call away and everybody really needs to understand that if they find themselves struggling that they can pick up their phone and engage with organizations such as sec talk to the team at the hub and we're able to assist you so I'm going to be talking you tonight about one of our initiatives that's operating it's an essential service it's called the people's pantry and in a way it's quite self-explanatory it is a pantry of food items that is made from community spirit we rely on donations we've been able to basically just to paint a picture the hub has been turned into pop-up trestle of to be able to support people who are struggling with food insecurity the people's pantry actually started in 2017 as an initiative to combat food insecurity then but now because of the economic and social impacts of covert 19 we're currently servicing over 100 families a week and the demand is ever growing we rely on donations but more than anything it's really important to know that if you are struggling with food insecurity or you know someone that is to please get in contact with southeastern community connect and the team at the hub as we are able to help thank you kate and mathieu what a great initiative the people's pantry is and I know a lot of people were grateful for the work you do and I know we sometimes take these basic needs for granted and and as you stated if your help is only a phone call away I would now like to invite mona luxon from base city care mona was bayside council's um citizen of the year in 2018 and does a great job in our community would also like to respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners of the land um and the elders both past and present um so um yep so my name is moana luxton and um I supposed to say hi to everyone and hope you're all doing well and keeping safe during this difficult time and so my role is I'm a counselor and a social worker and I've worked with bay city care for over 10 years now primarily as the coordinator of our counseling and domestic violence support centre bay city care is a non-government charity organization and uh we really value um the individual from a holistic perspective and so we our support

introduce our gm here at bayside council meredith wallace meredith will talk us through the many services programs and activities that we times thank you meredith thank you james and good evening everyone um I know that you will all have found the last few speakers so informative I'm going to keep this brief but I would like to say a couple of things about some of the programs that council has also been contributing to as as you've already heard tonight it is important that our community knows that no one has to go through these circumstances alone and in our own way we're here to help in any way that we can over the past year and a half council's put in place several financial relief measures for rate payers home renovators our local business community and sporting organizations such as waiving fees or interest on overdue payments additional funds have been allocated to develop care packages and provide small community grants councils also working closely with our local police south wales health and the local area health agencies to ensure that the key messages stay home wear a mask get tested get vaccinated reach everyone in the community particularly those who don't use english with our community in fact they're our eyes and ears in the past week they've made over 100 phone calls to check in with the most vulnerable those that are isolated and those that are having I guess experiencing the the hardest times at the moment they're committed to working to ensure our community stays connected and supported so be that our senior seats our youth young families the vulnerable or one of our many cultural or sporting organizations city life are made up of a team of professionals with experience they're well connected to both government and private agencies that can provide help and assistance so please if you need support or you know someone who's struggling please reach out if we can't assist we can certainly put you in touch with people who can we understand that it can be difficult for many to directly ask for help so to make it easier to minimize those difficult conversations the city life team have developed a connecting community's cover nighting directory which is available on council's website so www.bayside.net if you covers a range of emergency relief information so relevant information for aboriginal and torres strait islanders children's and families food outlets parenting support information from the department of housing disability assistance domestic violence homelessness mental health help for employees and help for businesses you'll also find information on where to get tested where to get vaccinated locally and much much more our team produced a monthly covered specific newsletter which can either be posted to vulnerable communities or sent out via email if you don't already get this newsletter you can register to receive a copy on our website and just sign up for the e-newsletter and sadly while our face-to-face events and activities are on hold we've moved many of them online our staying apart but keeping together online program is comprised of workshops learning opportunities and interactive activities and games this month we're hosting a lunch and learn series as well as our daily online program for 12 to 5 to 25 year olds again you can find out what's on and how to join on council's website and quite excitingly and we're encouraging everyone to get creative and enter your photos of everyday life during these unusual times will become part of our history and part of our library's historical records so that's a really brief synopsis of the many and varied ways council is providing support and assistance to the local community if you'd like more information please don't hesitate to contact council at any time remember we are here to help thank you thank you meredith I know you've only scratched the surface of what council is doing to assist and support our local community and as you said if you require help it's important to please reach out if anyone wants to find out more they can contact council's customer service center visit our website uh send an email or contact your local ward councillor we'll now commence the uh question and answer session I'm very mindful of the time as well so I'm gonna try to get through everything as quick as possible if we don't though that they will be on on the sending in your questions there is a lot of them so I'm going to group the subject matter or topic to get through so the first question I've got is is for angela I know someone who is suffering a lot of anxiety right now I have tried to help but I also feel that I'm feeling more anxious what can I do really good questions thank you deputy mayor um so this is twofold I guess um in terms of uh supporting your friend it's really important that you continue just to have open communication with that person um as they're reaching out to you and encouraging them to either follow up with their gp if they're being supported by their gp or to access some of the anxiety support resources that are out there and on the website there will be a whole heap of information about different places you can go to get some support around anxiety um there's a couple of handouts uh from an organization called this way up uh which is an online anxiety support and training some of those strategies that we talked about in terms of um using those grounding techniques uh using those um strategies to kind of look after yourself and address your anxiety so like sleeping eating those basic needs can often help with anxiety um where you might need a little bit more support is when anxiety symptoms really getting in the way of you being able to do functionally those things that you need to do throughout the day so if it's impairing your ability to care for yourself or care for your family or do the things you need to do in your day it's time to see the gp and get a referral uh for a a pro most likely a psychologist um so medication is just part of the treatment with anxiety most of it is around how we think um how we thinking affects how we feel and we have the ability to to really influence our thoughts around that um uh so that's what I would definitely encourage have a look at some of those anxiety management strategies that are out there because they are the first protocol in being able to access other supports and services out there thank you angela um the next question I have is for for both miffy and mona how can I help my local charities and organizations and to support those in need um thank you deputy bear look it's it's a it's a great question and there's a few ways in which people can join our quest to battle food insecurity the first would be to to jump online to the sec website it's hiding up behind me over there we have a donation page in which people can donate funds that help not only go towards the people's pantry but many other online community events ranging from parentage programs tax support well-being workshops so the first would be our donation page on the sec website the second if if someone wants to send a specific item I'll just very quickly tell you a wonderful email I received this afternoon from a family who have been accessing food relief from the pantry they simply uh had a and they said in this lovely uh note um that they sat down as a family and had boiled eggs and soldiers as a family for the first time in a long time and and how it was so much more than just the donation of a meal it was the reminder because they reached out that they were reminded everybody's saying at the moment we're all in this together they're saying that because it's actually true community spirit is stronger than it ever has been and donations to sec have a far-reaching impact so if anyone would like to give a specific item such as ten dollars can buy you um 50 nappies towards a family you can again go online to the set website and go to the people's pantry page and and organize a a covered safe delivery through either kohl's or woolworths online now the third option doesn't require any funds whatsoever and I'm originally from the country I'm a farm girl and I know the power of a bush telegraph and we have that in community donation or send an item you can tell someone you can set the challenge to just tell five people about food insecurity and about sex combat to end that through the people's pantry so again reaching out to the sec website following us on social media and instagram sharing it on your own networks that way we have a far greater reach of reaching families who are struggling to put food on the table um angela at the beginning of your pyramid food was the basis of that if we can't get the bottom of that pyramid right um we're going to tumble so sharing the story turning to social media and helping us spread the word of this relief program is there and as I've said before help starts with that phone call not only then we might be able to offer um food relief but we can check in and and offer other avenues of support as well because we are all in it together thank you mickey mona would you like to contribute to that thanks deputy mayor and thank you for that charity organization and we completely rely on the generosity of donations and volunteers and so please hop on to our website which is you can find it just behind me on the screen and will also be made available after the forum but please jump on and we have a um a a give page or donations page where you can go on there and give um and we also you know really appreciate as I said all our volunteers if you would be interested in volunteering at our food care our volunteers play a big part in our services down there and not just you know practically but also in connecting with our individuals and families that visit our our food care program many of which are you know suffering or dealing with food insecurities and just struggling financially through this very challenging time um you know we we have a huge variety of people that attend our food care program um solo parents uh you know we have um solo moms that come down with you know five and six children um and so it's it's practically and also uh you know to encourage them socially and just by having a chat with them so we appreciate and accept all support and help through our community whether it be financially or as I said through our volunteer opportunities thank you thank you um the next question I have is for the mayor what is the path to get out of being in an area of concern and what are the next steps uh sure look interesting question I guess we all know the rules are changing very frequently as we all know we currently have 12 declared areas of concern and base site unfortunately two weeks ago was added to the uh to the uh areas or the base side the base I was added to the declared lgas unfortunately we we haven't received a set of criterion where for bayside to be removed as an area of concern uh I'd have to say uh things that new south wales health would be looking at is fewer cases each day not on a single day but for continuous for few days fewer handling cases the problem where they're passing on the virus without being traced and improve vaccination rates and and also maintain high testing rates uh it's very important we all get vaccinated if feeling and will get tested and stay home let's do all we can to keep our community safe and hopefully come out of lockdown as an lga thank you mr mayor um my next question um is for angela um I know that uh the situation may go on for a while our family are already finding it tough emotionally and in other ways what can I do to get some help around these issues I think in the if we think about those basic needs so in terms of other ways looking at some of those practical supports um to assist basic needs such as food shelter financial support by using some of these services is the first step because that can improve well-being in terms of supporting well-being for the rest of the family and as a whole trying to do things together trying to have a little bit of fun with some of but also trying to reach out to some of those other mental health supports too so if you have um concerns around say young people who are in your family or um you know an adolescent or if you've got someone who's going through the hsc this year who may be impacted as well to reaching out to services such as headspace which is the youth mental health service or even just going to speak to your gp in the first instance and so you would do that particularly if over a couple of weeks a family member had really been impacted in their well-being and they had kind of persistent symptoms of feeling low or feeling very anxious or deteriorating in some way in terms of supporting general well-being around mental health I mean trying to um to stay active to stay distracted to look after your your health and your nutrition um to to try and maintain connections and it does take work to be able to do that um and I think it's the hardest thing is that we have to work hard to we we do prioritize our well-being and um prioritizing our well-being uh is is hard and really important too particularly if you're in a family where you are homeschooling you might be doing home day care at the same time you might have two partners working there's so much to juggle um so you're only going to be able to juggle that stuff if you're also looking after your own mental health and well-being as well too and that includes um you know sharing responsibilities if you have the ability to do that making sure that you take time out for yourself even if it's just to go for a walk around the block in one of the 15-minute allocations that you might give yourself um so there's a number of different things and it's really great to hear about all of the resources available on the bayside council website as meredith has outlined and uh and also in conjunction with some of those activity packs um and mental health resources which will be sent there's lots of options to be able thank you angela the next question I have is is for kate and the mayor um the question is I'm concerned about people isolating particularly the older and vulnerable people in our community what ways can we all help kate help if I unmute and to begin with as I was saying we're continuing to provide all our age services to the elderly residents in our community so if you know someone who may be in need of any services at this point in time you can refer them to us and we will make contact with them in addition to that we are also using our volunteers who are making contact and having regular conversations with our seniors in the community they're saying that the impact has been just as great for them as it has been in maintaining the contact with their other community members the other thing that um occurred a lot last year was that people within the community were reaching out to one another so if you do have an elderly neighbor and you have their phone number you know make it um if if you're on a if you don't have their phone number put a little note in their litter box and say hi I'm your neighbor I'm here if you need anything or if you need any supports just give me a call and leave your number behind the other thing as I'm saying is the little messages that people have been leaving on the street the chalk drawings that show everyone is connected um is is just you know it lifts your mood and as we were saying before things that are uplifting they send up all those um positive little neurons in our bay in our brain and make us feel happier when we're at the moment we've been locked in so much negativity and I think the other thing is is for ourselves is we can start changing our own narrative I mean it is a very difficult time for us but as we all know we're going to come out of this and if we use this time to make connections with one another and then with of lockdown we'll have these connections and we'll be able to make them face to face and then they'll be able to be sustained into the future thank you kate um mr mayor yeah uh thanks james look um with this question I i guess council uh is doing welfare checks via our library database so our staff are calling people and checking in and I i I'd share uh kate's comments about you know look out for your neighbor if they're in isolation offer to do their shopping take their rubbish out over the phone like I mean in my case my eldest neighbor I've taken her phone number and give her mine so um I make sure that I call and and check on her from time to time and you know and and I guess for any more help tips uh from the council's point of view uh on connected communities uh please visit our website and they'll they'll have a lot of uh helpful tips on how you could do that thank you mr man look probably got another just another couple of questions um this one from owner um my friend is in an abusive relationship and I'm worried about them being home together in their house for 24 7. what should they do thank you deputy mayor um domestic violence it is a very complex issue and unfortunately curved 19 has added an additional complexity um but safety is always priority and um whenever there's any case of an emergency um or if someone is in danger first first um thing to do is to call triple o immediately and uh to seek um help for that person um as well as that there is um also an opportunity for you to support your friend letting them know that you are there to help to encourage them to contact a local domestic violence service or the domestic violence hotline and the more information that perhaps you can gather and provide for them and uh the more informed they will be particularly uh if it isn't if it is unsafe for them to do so themselves um and uh a great a has some very helpful information and resources um on domestic violence and how to get help and support um but primarily it's it's uh the fact that you're there for your friend um is extremely valuable and uh you have a great opportunity just to ask be there and be a support and let them know that you're there and uh and to help them in any way you can thank you man um the next question I have is uh for mickey my partner and I have both lost our jobs we are finding it difficult to buy and pay or pay our bills buy food or food for our family can anyone access the people's pantry uh thank you deputy mayor look I'll just start by saying that it is the people's pantry so it's there for the people for the community members to access and I'd say to this particular household and I'm going to sound like a broken record pick up the phone and call the sec team get in contact with the community hub in going through a situation that we're hearing on a daily basis so they're not alone it's strength in numbers yes they can access the pantry but they can also engage with southeastern community connect and see what other services that we might be able to help them with financial relief or perhaps even more emotional and mental support as well thank you I've probably just got two more questions now the next question I

From the 1890s and those with keen eyes can see that there's no sydney airport runways on it there's no port botany jutting out into into the bay and you might also notice that the cooks river comes out into the bay at a different place to where it does today these are pretty huge differences to what we know today but the only the latest and by no means largest changes to the shore of the bay over many thousands of years and it's these ancient changes I'd like to talk about today in doing so I'm going to touch on some aspects of the long and continuing aboriginal history of the bay also but I do say from the perspective of a non-aboriginal archaeologist and historian and with um a bit of hesitation I'm now going to try and show you a video um that was created for the national museum of australia last year to give you a sense of aboriginal came and something to carry with you um as I talk about its ancient past so let's just give our people have been living here since time began our land waterways and sky are part of what we refer to as our country our spirit ancestors created our country and the various life forms within it giving us our kinship social structures and our laws kame botany bay provided gamango the people belonging to botany bay the resources needed to strive for many generations our responsibility to care for one another and our environment in a spiritual and sustainable way ensured our people not only survived but thrived in this part of our country you may hear and see different ways aboriginal people identify themselves these names describe different layers of identity some refer to family to the region where they were born and lived the language they spoke their connection to their spirit ancestors and the cultural status they held our old people taught us that your language and your country go together they cannot be separated our language gives our people a spiritual connection to our country including all life forms within it we continue to use our language to assert our ongoing by using their original names like barnaby which means water source and is the name for the northern hemiland of gamay which is where the laplace aboriginal community was permanently placed 136 years ago and means the place of the bush pigeon we call the sudden headland of gamay gibia and gundrum is the name of the place where the crew of the h embark endeavor landed bundle was adapted by europeans for colonel which is still used today other local names like tabagay yara and tara are still used by both aboriginal and non-aboriginal people around the way and on behalf of our people we hope you enjoy your visit to gammae well um you I'll put a link to that um that video at the end with some other things from the same website which hopefully you'll find of interest um about 10 years ago I went camping with my family out to far western new south wales along the barca the darling river and it was flowing at that time I took this photo of one of the lakes at menindee they've the 1950s one of the consequences is that the trees that used to live there have died and when it floods like in this photo it creates quite a strange sight of these dead trees poking up through the water what's this got to do with kame a thousand kilometers away well um you'll see in a minute now I've only got less than 20 minutes to cover 20 000 years so I better get started with a bit of time travel about 20 000 years ago there was a global ice age you might be imagining mammoths and glaciers and certainly some parts of the northern hemisphere had these but not in sydney here there was no ice the temperature was a few degrees colder but still sydney was a completely different form to today shaped by that ice age glaciers around the world had sucked up and stored a big part of the ocean this meant that the seas around the world were much lower than they are today in sydney they were about 100 meters lower that means that anywhere today where the water sydney harbour and all of kame for a start was dry land back then the actual ocean was many kilometers further east than today as you can see on this map I put this together from the detailed research of others on the bottom of the ocean and the bay by measuring how deep the water is now you can see what would have been dry land back then you can also trace the lines of creeks and rivers that once flowed across that land but are now drowned by the water so you can see today's coastline in grey outlined and everything that's green is was dry land 20 thousand years ago with the blue creeks running through to the ocean uh several kilometres further to the east this shows you what kame or rather pre-kame looked like the rocky cliffs of kernel and la peru's headlands existed but they weren't lapped by waves like they are today if you look to the east from these rocky hills you couldn't see the ocean instead you would have looked out across a massive flat plain ocean far off in the distance if you turned around instead of seeing the bay you would have seen a swampy sand plain you could have walked across this occasionally crossing a creek or river and if you got thirsty on the way you could have just drunk the water because this was all fresh water not salty if you went a bit further north to sydney harbour and walk down to the end of benilong point where the opera house now is it would have been like standing at one of those amazing lookouts in the blue mountains you would have been on the edge of a ridge looking down over a huge forested valley with a river at the bottom winding its way to the east back at came let's think about the rivers we all know the cooks and george's rivers as you can see they were pretty different too the cooks river flowed south across the swampy plain flanked by sand dunes it met the george's river in the middle of what's now kernel and then met the hacking river near what this was a freshwater river for most of its length not the tidal rivers that we know today when the camera area looked like this aboriginal people had already been living in the sydney region for hundreds of generations this was their country and they knew it intimately but it was also about to change massively around 18 000 years ago the world began to emerge from the ice age and things began to change as temperatures rose so did the oceans as the glaciers sent melting water back into the sea for the next 10 000 years the coastal plain that you can see on this map was eaten up by a meter or two at a time by the rising waters and this is where my menindee picture comes back in let's imagine what those rising seas would have looked like one or two meters per year means that in your lifetime 50 to 100 metres of land disappeared the forests on that land would have been drowned so for most of sydney's history since that ice age we didn't have stretches of sandy beaches today standing on the shore you probably would have been looking at something like these vast expanses of dead trees and think about what that would have been like for aboriginal people the ground literally would have shifted beneath their feet and this continued for hundreds of generations disappearing land would have been normal it would have been all that anyone alive had ever known that constant disappearing of the shoreline the idea of a shoreline staying still that we take for granted today probably would have seemed absurd the rising seas gradually began to create the sydney that we recognized today came began to form like a massive bathtub slowly filling up as water came through the heads the ancient cooks and george's river channel that headed through to the south was cut off as sand was pushed ashore to form the sandy georges at the sandy kernel peninsula these rivers became tidal rivers flowing into the north and south end of the bay as we see them in this picture by around 7 000 years ago the bay had taken its approximate current form that is minus in white there just to help you figure out where you are aboriginal people lived around the bay as these changes were happening and here I've shown you a couple of the more ancient aboriginal places it's a misleading map though because there were a number of changes that happened over the last 7 000 years that I'll explain a bit later the oldest site that we know about so far around the bay was found during the construction of apartments at walleye creek it was a fireplace that was found to be about 10 500 years old when aboriginal people sat around that fire the cook's river was still a freshwater river and the bay was still only partly formed a couple of thousand years later aboriginal people were camped around another fireplace where the prince of wales hospital now stands at randwick this was situated in a massive field of dunes which you can still sense when you drive past the university of new south wales randwick racecourse and the hospital these dunes are tens of metres deep and you can definitely feel going you're driving across between those dunes were swamps and aboriginal people caught fish in those swamps now this half that you can see pictured here with uh mary dallas an archaeologist on the left and uncle david ingray on the right uh was found in 1995 when the remains of of a cemetery were being removed above this in the dunes when they kept digging down some sharp-eyed archaeologists found those hearthstones what's really incredible is that they were able to date how old that half was from sand grains around the half there's a technique that archaeologists use which can tell you how long it is since sand grains have been exposed to light and from that they could tell that the half had been there 8 500 years ago and even more than that just this small hearth was able to yield something really interesting and personal there was residues of of fat spattered around on the stones and microscopic analysis of those found that they were fat from freshwater fish so suddenly we could see just from looking at those stones that 8 500 they they'd um caught in the swamps when they were here the peninsula between the bay and the ocean was shrinking because the sea was still rising botany bay hadn't quite reached its current form and these are just two of many hundreds or thousands of places that aboriginal people used at different times when the environment was changing like this these deep dunes are still there under roads and buildings all around the bay and most of the eastern suburbs and more traces of this ancient past continues to be found now I mentioned that the sea reached its current level about six to seven thousand years ago but it didn't stop there over the next few thousand years the sea rose and fell a few more times on at least one occasion around 6 000 years ago it rose one or two metres higher than today came got even bigger it spread across the low-lying areas to the north extending across what's now sydney airport maybe as far up as moore park into these shallow waters swam a dugong which aboriginal people killed and on the on the left hand on your right hand side there uh were found when workmen were digging alexandra canal in the 1890s I found many meters below the ground in the mud that's the canal that runs along the western edge of sydney airport at tempe they also found buried tree stumps that showed that there must have been times when the environment was very different it was big news because until then non-aboriginal people assumed that aboriginal people had only lived in australia for a very short time and they also assumed that the landscape had never changed from what they could see this was the first clue that kame had an ancient history whole landscapes that once existed and were now buried meters underground but they also realized that aboriginal people had lived in these ancient landscapes back then they had no way to know how long ago this was but in 2004 radiocarbon dating of the jugong bones showed that they were 6 000 years old by about 3000 years ago the sea levels stabilized aboriginal people camped on this shoreline and fished the places along with rock engravings and other traces of their use many of them are still there and to protect them I've not shown where they are but in addition to those we know about there are also many more that lie hidden beneath the sands sometimes these come to light for example workmen digging trenches at san soucy nearly a hundred years ago found axes shells and human remains from campsites a meter or more below the ground and so and during the construction of walleye creek apartments about 15 years ago the fireplace I mentioned was found also quite a long way beneath the ground the reason these have survived is because partly because the houses and other structures built around the bay over the last 200 years have not mostly dug that deep into the sand they've sat on top of the sand but these days we're building more and more things and we're digging deeper and and building bigger digging through those sands for the first time in many cases we need to be very careful that we don't discover this of destroying it because then it will truly be gone forever some councils around the bay such as sutherland have tried to address this by putting in place procedures to make sure that aboriginal sites like these are investigated before developments happen but most of camae is sadly still not covered by procedures like this but back to the shifting shoreline even though sea levels had stopped changing by about 3 000 years ago the shoreline was still not fully formed the big wetlands of tower point and quibre bay you can see on the southern side of the bay there only formed around a thousand years ago these wetlands created rich fishing grounds for aboriginal people and some of the biggest and best preserved aboriginal sites around the bay are found along this old shore at cornell sydney's history is often discussed as though it started when cook and the endeavour arrived in kame 250 years ago clearly that's completely wrong because aboriginal people have been living in sydney for thousands of generations by that time but because of this fixation on cook and the first fleet see the land they described more than 200 years ago as being the real kame the real sydney because it's familiar with us today but this is also wrong because the environment has changed so much and this latest version of of kame has only been around for a very short amount of time consider what this map made by cook in 1770 would have looked like if he'd sailed in a thousand years earlier tower appointed the southern end of the bay wouldn't have existed and the whole southern shore would have looked quite different what would it have looked like six thousand years ago when the bay was much bigger than it is today and what would it have looked like ten thousand years ago when he couldn't even sail the boat in because the bay didn't exist cook saw and described aboriginal people everywhere around the bay but he was ignorant about the massive environmental changes of the bay and they were also ignorant about the ancient and deep aboriginal connections to the place when the first fleet arrived 18 years later and were not interested in these connections and as the colony grew aboriginal people faded out of the history books but they never left the bay they've always been here even if they had their presence has been ignored some of their ancient campsites continued to be used as we can see from glass and metal tools sometimes mixed into them and aboriginal people living around the bay told the names of some of the places to early surveyors like you can see in this 1827 map of colonel these names still survive 200 years later as you heard in that video clip kernel tower cronulla wool aware weenie all of these names are still used and as well the descendants of the people who lived in these places still survive in other cases aboriginal people have fought to have traditional names reinstated like came itself the aboriginal people who lived around kame in the 19th century found new ways to live in the growing city of sydney they still connected with their traditional country its lands and waters and still spoke their language and practiced customs things were basis of this deep connection a connection that partly was forged by their ancestors having witnessed the very formation of the landscape in which they lived by the end of the 19th century most aboriginal people around sydney had come to live at gourable la peruse over the past century these people have witnessed the most recent changes to the bay as the bay floor has been dredged to build runways and ports and the whole course of of the cook's river has changed these changes were rapid drastic and man-made but just as before aboriginal people have lived through these changes and they still live around came that story is not mine to tell but I highly recommend that you check out these two websites the top one is made for the 100th anniversary of sydney airport last year and has a lot of content about some of the aboriginal sites and aboriginal people who've lived around the bay and the bottom one was from a national museum exhibition last year about the 250th anniversary of cook and tells the story of that encounter from an aboriginal and learn more about the aboriginal connections to this amazing place and that's all I've got to say so thank you for listening you

having fun with me and I hope to see you very soon bye you
Uh great to be presenting here again oh recording in progress okay uh oh I can see myself there I'm gonna share my screen uh in a minute anyway but so thanks everyone for coming along my name is glenn the company's id id stands for informed decisions we have put together a series of online information tools to help local governments with evidence-based decision making these are also public access tools so everyone can can access these and they provide a demographic story of your area we've just we've just come out of the 2021 census hopefully everyone filled in their census form a lot of the work that we do uses that census data to uh to really help understand what's the role and function of each place within your area what's what demographic story that it's tell every suburb every town is different in australia and the census brings out a lot of those those different characteristics we have a tool online which you can access called the community profile and also the accompanying social atlas which allows you to your area in focusing on a particular suburb or now just as of last week we've launched a new module on the community profile called communities of interest so you can also focus on a specific sub-population group for instance you can do a profile of all the population or youth or people from a non-english speaking background or people with a need for assistance with disabilities so we've got those those as well so uh it's quite a quite a bit in there I've only got half an hour so it's not a um not going to go into a huge amount of detail but certainly want to make you aware of what's what's available there and how you can use that yourself so I will share my screen and get started I will call for questions in a few points uh cali can you see the screen all right there yep that all looks good thanks okay so this is the bayside council community profile to get to it uh profile dot id dot com dot a u slash bayside in home page although I haven't had time to check that today we you go baseline council community profile it's under home community in the uh on the bayside council website and you can link into the community profile also our population forecast and economic profile which I won't be going into detail but there is there is some information on the uh on the local economy and workforce as well as the uh the future population primarily I'm going to be having a look at the community profile which is available to all and provide you with a lot of information up to the last census and a little bit of information beyond that in that we have population updates every year we have a bit of information on job seeker recipients in there as well and some migration information which is updated every year as well but most of the information here is from the 2016 census but it goes right back to the 1991 census in australia we have censuses every five years and they provide a really useful time series a snapshot you can see exactly how your area is changing over time we do have this information for every suburb uh I'm going to pop an award for every suburb and ward within bayside council you can see the the individual suburbs uh listed in here and also on the map and the uh the five wards are available there so everything you see on here is available at that geographic level for each suburb individually and each of those wards individually as well if you want to look at in that at that level the it's fairly simple in terms of select the suburb you can see the current the latest 2020 population estimate for that suburb population density and land area you can see the boundary of that area and where it relates to we've adjusted previous years of census data so we've got 2016 the last census is the latest year but all the previous years are adjusted to match that current boundary even if the suburbs change and they do sometimes change so we've adjusted to that that current boundary so if to start actually is the population highlights page where you can get some basic information for your particular suburb your latest population and then going back to the 2016 census what was the average age median age a few other characteristics like the number of different types of households types of housing costs of mortgages and rents household incomes all the things that you probably remember recently filling in on the census uh compared to baseline council area greater sydney sydney and new south wales and also with a little comparison over time this you can see how it's gone up or down in that just that last census period we get the 2021 census data although we've a lot of the census collection is finished we don't get the data until mid next year when we'll be rolling that into the site and you'll get a full update on that in the meantime there's some basic things like population numbers that are updated more regularly there and you can see that's in the population highlights page but the bulk of the detailed interest module which I'll get to in a minute area profiles takes you through a series of 38 different central census topics to help you understand your particular place how old are we which is three different measures of age groups who are we which is everything about your cultural diversity language birthplace religion and ancestry education levels and also disability or need for assistance which is a very specific measure of disability which is in the census uh next census by the way is going to have well you may remember filling it in had uh had the um long term health conditions question which will be a very interesting one too which we'll have on the on the site so soon as well uh what do we do uh it's everything about employment unpaid work and incomes and how do we live which is households housing tenure and dwelling information so every topic is available and it's set up in the same way on here so if I go into somewhere like five year age groups that's about telling the the most fundamental we're looking at bexley there uh it says gives you a headline figure tells you exactly what the census question was that was asked why you use it and other topics to build up a story of that place and then you've got a table with the latest census broken down into those age groups and one earlier census you can flip that earlier census over to anything right back to 1991 and the bottom line tells you then how how much the total population of that area has changed in the in the time period you've got selected so you can do five through to 25 years we'll be adding obviously another another census next year and you can see how that compares to a benchmark so your benchmark is either bayside council greater sydney the southern sydney region ss rock which is a group of councils in the southern sydney area new south wales in australia or you can compare one suburb to another so if you want to compare directly bexley to east lakes you can also do that and it updates this in a pdf copy clipboard is my favorite just click on that control v paste it into word excel powerpoint and away you go you're welcome to use any of these so these are public access sites you don't need to ask our permission to use the um the data sets in any reports anything you're doing uh we have uni students using it for school for projects and uh uh assignments and that sort of thing we have people from real estate and uh and that sort of thing doing doing research so were you welcome to use that council actually does pay for this service on behalf of the wider community but just make sure you keep that source information attached which it automatically does when it does that export then the second chart we call the emerging chart that says how has this characteristic changed in the time period you have selected there so you can pick your area pick your benchmark and pick your time period and then you can see over that five year period oh our biggest increase in that suburb clear aging process you can also represent that in percentage terms and you can see that if you do that over 25 years you can see there's actually more kids over to 25 years but in percentage terms it's predominantly increases in people in their 50s through to 85 plus there in that time period so quite a lot of differences there and you can follow that through by looking at other topics for instance household types in in bexley there we've got uh well it's compared to east lake so I might just change that back over to the bayside council so you can see actually is much more of a family area overall than bayside council uh it's got more one-parent families and more couples with children and generally less lone persons although that's increased over time the number one person households so you start to build up a story of the place you could then say well what does our what do our culturally diverse groups look like in this area so we can have a look at what languages have people spoke a language other than english at home uh and you can see the the different so different groups they're arabic is the the largest one greek macedonian uh and you'll see a little a next to these that means you can map that in the atlas so if you go over there it opens up a map which is the social atlas window here and it's selected people speaking arabic at home if you go onto the map selector you can see we've got a wide range under the diversity heading of different countries of birth and languages that you can map the distribution of in the area along with things like income levels and household types and age groups and different types of housing as well so you can easily flick over and say uh I want to have a look at I don't know how many where are people renting you can see that on the map that's mapped at the sa1 level which is the smallest geographic unit that the census releases that information as so if we just was people speaking arabic at home what you can see is almost all uh on the western side of the the airport there so the airport sort of divides the bay side there into the the eastern and western parts so that particular language is mainly focused over here if you want to know what suburbs they are you can actually click on that and see what see where they are so on cliff and bardwell park seemed to have the uh the bulk of that particular language speaking group uh you can also export these atlas maps into image files and then raw data into a comma separated format which going to excel again you're welcome to use all of those those tools if you want to as well so um that's how the area profiles work uh you um I might just open it up how many people we've got here um I'm just uh sort of 12 participants I if anyone would like to maybe go through the just briefly over a few minutes the story of a particular suburb I picked bexley a particular suburb you'd like to maybe go through the the characteristics for um let me know any suburbs someone carols would hand up uh will I creek oh carol do you have one oh so we have tarella came through in the chat okay let's look at terrell we've got torilla bardwell valley okay so I'm on the language spoken at home uh one there uh for torilla bardwell valley so the one that that because I've got that selected there will continue through so we can see the languages there 52.7 percent of people speak a language other than english again and we actually already saw this on the atlas that that area has a uh a very high arabic speaking population but also lots of people speaking mandarin macedonian and you can see the others in there show all actually gives you all of the language groups down to 10 people in that community and 10 sort of the limit of the resolution of the census data so less than 10 is not reliable you can see that they're compared to to the age groups so I'm interested to see what sort of community that is in terms of age structure and you can see there compared to bayside council area which is our chosen benchmark I can also flip that over to greater sydney and it makes a difference to how we're making that comparison but generally that area has a younger adult people in their 20s population with some young children but not many uh teenage children so it's a families with young children and probably young singles sort of area and that's by far the biggest increase in that last five-year period there so I'm going to move through to the household types which are under how do we live and you can see certainly is a family with children area there's also a lot of couples without children and group households and they are sort of house sharing arrangements in there the group households uh increased at the same time no couples without children increased so what we're seeing is a relatively young population of families settling down to have've got probably um a lot of people from uh different birth places 42.9 of people were overseas born and you can see a big increase in the chinese population people born in china at that last census period we could also look at for instance some of the socio-economic characteristics uh what are the income levels look like for that area uh terrella bardwell valley these are two fairly small suburbs so that's why they've been combined as one that one area right here mostly it's one suburb per area but there's a few that do get combined from very small places or places that are mostly industrial get combined with others um glenn we had a request um to look at daceyville uh yeah we can do that I'll just just finish this off there for torilla bardot valley you can see there generally sort of a middle middle to uh higher income area there but not that much different from greater sydney overall I'll go back to the age group so I tend to start with age groups because the sort about an area with the uh with the age groups uh so let's have a look at daceyville and daceyville on the other side of bayside of course only 1200 people in daisy wants quite a small suburb and it didn't change much of last century increase of 43 people now that's though very very different to the ones that's uh so far I'll compare that to bayside council area overall but either way you can see all the young people there are missing all of the well not somewhat younger there's quite a few teenagers but younger adults some people in their 20s are kind of missing and there's lots of older population people so baby boomers up to their early 70s and also a lot of 85 plus in their change though we've got increases in those teenagers and younger adults over time and the the interesting thing about daisy villafoot if we look at something like the housing tenure how people are occupying housing is that it is a major social or public housing area and that's the most people are renting from the government with 63 of housing there that is um generally social housing is targeted at a more disadvantaged population and so you'll probably end up with things like lower incomes and lower we call the socioeconomic status which is the uh called the see for index you can see that here daceyville has much much lower incomes probably majority of pensioners so much lower incomes and that does lead to a lower we call safer score which councils use this information to allocate resources and apply for for funding as well the lower the score the more disadvantaged the area and daceyville does come up as the most disadvantaged area in bayside by quite a large margin in fact it's in the bottom two percent of australia most of bayside council areas are relatively high safer that higher the number means less disadvantage or more advantage but there's a few pockets there or significant disadvantage and you can also see that on the atlas atlas under income and well-being the safer index of disadvantage and this is staceyville up the very are disadvantaged pockets in other parts of bayside but that's the most significant one there um glenn another question came through around um data um around centerlink payments uh or disability support pensions where do we go to access that kind of information that's not directly collected in the census so we don't have um we don't have disability support information on here but there's quite a few things that you can look at to get to see you can see the job seeker rates in here as well so the uh apart from sydney airport which doesn't have any population uh you've got places like uh banks meadow and that daceyville pagewood area has got a high rate of people on jobseeker botany's got a very low rate there you've also got the community of interest called the need for assistance community of interest so this is about all the characteristics of people who marked consensus that they had a disability and a need for assistance with everyday life if you go and have a look at that one the group and you can compare that sub-population to the same group elsewhere or to the total population of your area of bayside council okay great okay okay will you show us yeah I'm just going through it now I'll use that as a to go into the communities of interest module so this we hear in the need for assistance one so this is specifically looking at people who marked on the census that they had a need for assistance what you can see is that they are generally elderly so that's more common in the 85 plus group than any other but particularly so in bayside council compared to greater sydney you've got less young people with the need for assistance and more people in those older groups so the um you can also explore things like their employment status now not surprisingly most of them being uh older are not in the labor force so they're retired 86 of them are retired or otherwise not in the labor force and in fact that's a slightly lower rate than the the average for unemployment rate of 11.9 but that is uh of course um only of those that are working on looking for work you can also see things like what type of housing that they live in the need for assistance um community there it's actually although you've got that social housing in daisyville for bayside council overall only 11.6 of those needing assistance we're in social housing a lot of them are full homeowners which means that they are probably older population and pensioners but they do fully own their home and you can explore some of the other characteristics on here as well do they have internet connection uh what sort of dwellings of types they occupy and do they have motor vehicles the the dwelling type one that also shows that 15.1 percent uh of those with a need for assistance live in non-private dwellings uh and that's quite high non-private dwellings includes nursing homes so your other communities of interest for instance you can look at the same thing for those on low income so specifically low income households uh the um people low-income households there are more in the elderly groups as well or seniors at least not necessarily the elderly but 65 plus uh but also more young people in greater sydney so what you're doing in all of those is comparing to the benchmark how does this differ from the same group elsewhere that you can also compare this to the total population of bayside so this is saying those in low-income households how do they compare to the total population of baseline uh and you can see there are certainly more in the elderly groups there but the biggest increase has actually been uh young people in low-income households um glenn just one more question in the chat is around english proficiency with the new communities of interest module can you look at people who speak a language other than english and work out which of those groups have a lower proficiency in english absolutely that's very specifically one of the things that community of interest does so to do that you go into here this is the non-english speakers um community venture it's probably a not non-english speakers it's people whose first language is in english so proficiency in english will actually tell you what their level of english proficiency is so you can see there in 2016 13 075 non-english speakers in bayside council reported difficulty speaking english but that's of a total of 82 000 so the vast majority 83 percent had good english proficiency as self-reported and you can see there um that as a percentage 15.9 percent spoke another language and spoke english not well or not at all now you can also drill into this this is enormously different by language so the community of interest there has a selection of some of the key language groups uh for to profile so you can get a full profile based on all of these characteristics the the age groups the birthplace the need for assistance employment status incomes and housing types and all that sort of thing for each of these language communities individually so if we pick say the nepalese community you can see that uh there's very good english proficiency in the nepalese community so 93 or well um if you look at say arabic you can see that's also quite high but not quite as high as the nepalese one so it does vary quite a bit from from community to community and is this searchable through the atlas as well some of this data yeah the the distribution of those communities is on the atlas but the breakdown and and proficiency in english is also shown so not fluent in english you can map that one but you can't map the crosstab you can't map individual languages by proficiency yeah so that's too detailed to show at that very fine geographic level you can see the poor english proficiency is highest around the uh um is that rockdale town centre I think right there banksia in that area um so back onto the communities of interest there so you've also got with those language communities so we can see their chinese speakers have got well they're still 74 speak english well um 25 percent uh so that they don't that's self-reported as well so you just in english
Good evening everyone I'm meredith wallace the general manager of bayside council welcome to our virtual town hall our third bayside online forum tonight's online community forum provides an opportunity to discuss the resources and financial packages available to small businesses during these unusual times small business especially small local businesses rely heavily on the local community to thrive and survive so these unusual times of lockdowns and shutdowns have made it especially difficult for the small business owner particularly I think when it comes to finding out or working out just what help is out there for them so tonight this forum is a great opportunity for them to ask questions directly to those who know and who can help and advise we're really fortunate tonight to be joined by the minister for finance and small business the honorable damian tudehope as well as the shadow minister for small business and the member for rockdale mr steve camper also joining us we have the mayor of bayside councillor joe wada and our deputy mayor councillor james mcdonald mr john quick the council relationship manager from service for the bayside bec welcome everyone and thank you for your time this evening I'd now like to introduce the deputy mayor councillor james mcdonald to open the forum this evening thanks james thank you meredith um to officially open uh this evening's forum I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of australia and recognize their continuing connection to land water and culture I'm currently on the land of the gadigal and digital people of the urination and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging and again welcome everyone this evening we will hear from our guest speakers followed by a question and answer our session many of you have already submitted questions online but there is also an opportunity for you to ask a question by the chat button during the session which goes directly to the host we will answer as many questions as possible in the allotted time and attempt to address the most common things however please include your email address as you raise your questions so we can come back to you uh if we run detailed uh response thank you all for joining us this evening it gives me great pleasure to now introduce the miniature minister of finance and small business business the honourable damian chido good evening everybody and thanks very much for having me this evening and uh these forums are a fantastic way of being able to uh to talk about the impact on on small business I want to start by acknowledging all those who are present and are uh mr mayor mr deputy mayor um it is your involvement that makes sure that businesses get an opportunity of of hearing from steve and I i just want to say something about my enemy steve camper he and I are really great mates one of the things about politics is is that you can have differences of views but you should never have a circumstances where you become enemies in a sense and steve and I have a wonderful working relationship throughout this pandemic he's had no hesitation in picking up the phone to me and highlighting difficulties which uh businesses might be suffering uh or alternatively making suggestions uh out to business and I'm sure he will he will be very erudite in talking about how we could potentially do it better however they're all suggestions which are part of the unraveling of the assistance which is necessary to make sure that businesses survive both he and I come from a background where we were in small business I came to politics pretty late in life as did he for that matter but we came to it from a a background of looking after small business I in fact had my own small business and I was a lawyer and had a suburban legal practice and uh I had a significant amount of small businesses as my clients and not only that I was involved in the child care industry and had a number of child care businesses which I was involved in running so I had a fairly significant grasp of the impact of small business and I i it got me thinking at the start of this pandemic about how does a business cope in circumstance where a government issues a public health order or alternatively reduce the number of customers you have coming through the door uh you've got to be able to potentially just serve take away all the like but so you limit your customers but at the same time you've got obligations to pay your staff you've got obligations for your uh for to pay your rent you've got obligations to pay your bank you've got obligations to pay your suppliers so in my world that would have been like the absolute recipe for stress for a business owner and I'm sure uh the nature of lockdowns has been such that business owners who invested their life in trying to run a small business provide for their family and provide for the communities in which they live uh placed in that circumstance where they just don't know how they are going to cope moving forward and that's why there is an obligation on government to find ways that we can assist businesses to make sure that they are still able to reopen when this pandemic is finally over so a number of foremost thing which I encourage people to do and if you listen to the 11 o'clock press conferences every day or when the premier is speaking uh there is a constant message about the obligation to for as many people as possible to get vaccinated and that 70 80 80 plus mark is such an important goal for small businesses to be able to reach because they are the key milestones where certain freedoms will be available to business so first and foremost I want to get that message across to the extent that you are a small business the message that you should be sending out there is is the importance of getting vaccinated for our part the government though needs to make sure that we provide assistance to businesses by financial assistance and rental assistance for the purpose of getting through this and there have been a number of packages along the way and initially uh people were recalled they were the business support grants and they were the seven and a half thousand ten and a half thousand fifteen thousand dollar grants then that uh evolved uh grants which are aligned to uh the payroll of eligible businesses and forty percent of the payroll of the business was paid to businesses to assist them with the expenses of running the business and then thirdly there was another form of grants for the purposes of helping micro economic businesses which were the for the businesses uh who had a turnover of less than 75 000 dollars per per year and I must say that there is no other jurisdiction in australia which is the has made available microeconomic grants so they are the three tiers of of grants which are available in addition to that there were opportunities for land tax relief there were opportunities for payroll deferrals and waivers and a range of other targeted goals potentially for accommodation providers and the like which were made available for the government what I'd say in relation to those grant programs is that there is a tendency of businesses to self-assess their eligibility uh john will talk later from service new south wales and I'm so grateful to him he and I are a bit in a lot of the information relating to how service new south wales actually get the money out the door but one of the important things is is often businesses self-assess in relation to whether they're whether they're eligible I'd be encouraging businesses to say please do not self-assess if you have been impacted and you might be encouraging entitled to a grant get an application in or get advice from a service near south wales or from an accountant or from a financial advisor or from a business concierge service which we provide for the purpose of providing people with advice because where it is so important that businesses survive and there may be an opportunity for businesses to be able to of are themselves I've agreed uh and for that for that reason uh it's so important to get advice um there's another uh component in relation to the assistance which we provide business and that's rent relief and the office of the small business commissioner provides a mediation service so as to assist businesses to make sure that they can impacted by a lockdown and the we reinstated the national code and have made it absolutely compulsory for landlords to negotiate with their tenants in relation to rent relief either by waiver of rent or alternatively deferral and I can talk about that if people have specific questions in relation to it so two components is helping with the expenses of business and they are the things that the day-to-day things which you have to pay to be able to keep your business they're going and they're the job saver or microeconomic grants or alternatively rent relief which is available through the office of the small business commissioner what about your employees your employees who you have stood down or have less work to do are able to go to service australia for a commonwealth grant which is a commonwealth covert disaster grant which allows them depending upon the number of hours per week that they've lost to be able to make a claim uh of either 750 per week or 450 depending upon the amount of hours which they have lost so individuals they go south wales for assistance there are lots more that I can say but where we are heading at the moment and where businesses uh protect potentially worrying about the future is what happens about the opening up um of my business come mid october now or that date when we hit the magical 70 time I anticipate there will be questions in relation to that some will have seen the minister for customer services out today talking about the new qr code arrangements there is work to be done in order to give business assurance both in relation to their staff uh both in relation to uh people who are unvaccinated and the customers that will be coming through their businesses and how they deal with that we are currently working through that um I anticipate people have questions uh in respect of that and I will do my best to be able to give some assurance in relation to that but what I want to say is is that there potentially is a a an exciting time as we do reopen businesses because there is well we detect that enthusiasm and consumer confidence out there for people to again get out and go to shops and we ought to be welcoming new south wales as being that state which will be the first state to rejoin the world so to speak where we can get on planes again where we can actually travel and when we can actually go to a regional new south wales and have holidays again with our family so it's an exciting time ahead it should be a fantastic christmas um I I'm delighted to be with you uh here tonight and I'm hopefully later on during the q a uh if people do have questions uh I'll be able to participate in that question time and have some answers for people who may have those questions so thanks for having me tonight uh that's a very brief overview of what's available um but there are lots of other people who have a contribution to make and I don't want to infringe on their time so thank you for the opportunity to be with you you minister I and that of the new south wales government I would now ask the local member for rockdale and shadow minister for small business mr steve camper to say a few words well thank you james and good evening everybody and uh a special thanks to uh to the to the minister for being here with us tonight it's my privilege to be here too and uh damian uh if I can call him damian as a mate uh he hit the nail on the head we've uh we've this is these are difficult times it's been extremely difficult time for the business community and we've been working closely with working together I think I've been a little bit of a headache for him during the process but he's been fantastic I just want to I just want to start also by saying I want to thank all of the small business community out there and here with us tonight for the sacrifices they've made over the last 12 weeks because it's a big thing to ask a small business to basically hold on to its costs and then all and they've also got their own family their own family budgets and commitments to to keep and just to sit there and wait for for some handouts to try to try and keep you afloat over this period of time so it is a big call I don't know whether uh the greater community does appreciate how much of a sacrifice you've made I definitely do um I'm a bit like damian I've got a 30-year history in business I've represented small business all my life and uh there's been nothing more painful than having to navigate through this process and let's let's get it you know let's get it straight I think um at the start of this it was only ever intended I think it was perceived to be a two or three week shutdown period and the government made a best effort to try and cover everyone for that period of time they came out with the covered small business grants of uh started off at 10 as a it started looking like it was going to be a little bit longer than that damien and the government increased that to 15 down to seven to seven or seven and a half so there it has been a moving feast and from there we moved into the job saver had to uh unfortunately the federal government didn't didn't really step up at the start to try and support the state that's my opinion and uh that and uh don pereta and uh damien were very brave and they said we're going to take this on we're going to enable service new south wales to deliver this this complex complex rollout uh service new south wales and I don't think I'm I'm out of school here john was never really designed to set up to to manage this type of this type of process and it's been extremely hard and on many occasions we people like myself have probably criticized along the way but I know how tough it's been uh it's it's not it's not as geared up and um and have the capacity to manage this thing uh we we're now 12 weeks down I think most of the problems most of the problems have been sorted there was a big delay in people getting paid and it was really horrible to watch uh business sit there with you know begging begging for assistance when you've made such a sacrifice I think we I think we're getting there in terms of uh covering most of the problems uh there's a lot of questions in terms of moving forward that is that is uh of great concern to business uh we've got to be having some of the conversations today about tomorrow uh we can't_''_1115.2 be uh you know just trying to kind of patch things up as we go as we've experienced over the last 12 12 weeks with it by mid october we're looking at opening up what does that look like what type of how do we de-risk how do we de-risk the business community through that process you know if whatever whatever it is uh we've got to take the pressure off the business community in terms of uh of uh how they engage with their clients with their employees we've got to look at the the the insurance public liability risks there's there's a fruit bowl of issues that can only be that we can only protect business from uh by having clearly defined rules and laws and I think if we can have some conversations around that tonight it will be great uh the we we um we don't want a situation where the business community is saying well if I employ this person and they're not vexed uh and there is a workplace um uh infection uh there's suddenly uh a particular whether it's a workers comp claim or whether there's a claim because that person's infected a customer who where are the liabilities where where do I sit as a business we need to shore these things up we need to shore these things up and we need to uh make sure that there's continued support financial support through's not um it's not that simple to say shut down uh a lot of people carrying stock that that uh that's perished and they they need to replace stock they don't have the funds for that uh and and they need they need some uh they need this job saver to continue throughout the br throughout this um this period of startup it's going to be it's going to be tough sometimes some rules or some uh funding doesn't suit everyone but we've got to try and get it as right as possible and where we need to target target particular sectors or businesses we need to be thinking about that now as well so these are the challenges that are ahead uh I've spent the last 12 weeks just focusing on sorting out uh individual business issues now we it's it's not about scoring political points uh it's it uh through times like this we all need to work together to help each other through this and I believe that's what we've been doing with an opposition spokesperson I've worked very closely with the treasurer and uh the finance minister to work through issues and will continue to do that and it's very important that uh from tonight that we hear everything you've got to say because the more information we get from you out there you know fighting fighting this fight on the front line the better it is for us to be able to try and formulate uh ideas or put together ideas in terms of how we can help you but I think it's best I'll move on I stopped from here and we'll move on to the next speaker thank you thank you steve great advice as always and as you said it's important to work together it's very important I would now like to introduce the mayor of bayside council councillor joe water thank you uh councillor mcdonald uh before I begin I'd like to acknowledge the traditional custodian of the land I pay my respect to elders past president emerging from the garrible ambitionable plans of the urination good evening'd like to also acknowledge and welcome the minister for small business the honorable damian tudo and the shadow minister for small business mr steve kampa welcome it is such an honor to have you both joining us this evening economists often talked about businesses needing certainty and stability to survive and thrive they have had neither in the past 18 months yet we have seen new businesses popping up established businesses adapting to selling online coming up with initiate ways to continue operating in the face of adversity sadly some have also had to shut their doors and many might not return but like all australians our businesses are resilient and they are innovative they are survivors there are over eighteen thousand businesses in bayside who during the good times provided employment for over 95 000 workers when you consider our population just over 178 000 that's a pretty big contribution to the local economy and to our community and as we have just heard all levels of government are providing financial support in order to keep our economy going financial support is important but what can we answer is simple we need to give support how do we give that support well it can be as small as buying coffee every day from your local cafe or making a purchase online that you've been putting off or saving up for or you might order a meal from a restaurant that is now offering takeaway dinner packages we can all do a bit play our parts council is also doing what it can to help the small business just recently removing interest from overdue rates and not charging interest on rate payments full rent full rental waiver for commercial tenants who are unable to operate their businesses because of the current covet restrictions back council has also waived fees for outdoor dining and footpath trading work zone permits also been weighed and development application fees for residential application up to a hundred thousand dollars council covert financial relief package for both community and businesses is estimated to be around 3.6 million full details are available on our website at www.bayside.nsw.gov we're also looking ahead to the christmas new year period in the coming weeks staff will of commerce to discuss our buy in bayside guide we are compiling a free directory of local businesses that will help residents know where they can support and buy local especially in the lead up to the holiday season I guess because we say when you support a small business you are supporting your local community and thank you thank you mr mayor for that report as your deputy and the councillor on bayside council I'm really proud of what we've done to support our entire community through these unusual times many businesses council included have had to adapt to make changes in order to continue to operate on a bailey on a daily basis tonight I would like to share an example of how one local business quickly turned a negative into a positive and has thrived despite the lockdowns and restrictions here is archie rose covert survival story hi everyone um my name is will edwards and I'm the founder of archie rose distilling company um and thanks for having me it'd be better if we could do it in person but we are look at the camera and look today I wanted to give you a little bit of a background on who we are and what we do but also chat through how we uh responded and were influenced by both the lockdown in 2020 as well as the lockdown we're currently in in 2021 so for those of you who aren't aware um archie rose we're a small distillery uh making gin uh vodka whiskey rum a number of products actually we're probably most well known for our our gins and our whiskeys uh we've got a range of of three gins at the moment and we do a bunch of limited limited releases now and then and on the whiskey front uh we produce a single malt whiskey and a rye mult whiskey albeit they're a little bit hard to find because um good problem to have but they just constantly sell out we just don't have the stock at the moment but I'll come back to that so we started in rosebury we've got a little site in rosebury which about 500 square meters two thirds of it is the original distillery and then one third of it is the cocktail bar which outside of lockdown would operate seven days a week roughly midday to midnight and we've got little cellador there doing takeaway as well we moved from the rosebury site down to our new site in banks meadows obviously bayside in early 2020 right at the start of 2020 is when we started production down there and I won't go into the details just due to time as to why we made the move overall but one of the fundamental things was just we were running out of capacity the site at rosebury was too small we couldn't keep up with the demand for our core products while also having the capacity to focus on innovation and r d which is really important to what we do so we spent about three years designing and building a brand new distillery in in banks meadow which at this point is the largest distillery in australia and I'd be pretty confident in saying one of the it's been fantastic so that's enabled us to increase our capacity hire a bunch of new staff currently we're about 70 75 staff before the move we're about 50 and we're continuing to grow and yeah so I'll jump into some of the lockdown effects so 2020 obviously probably the scarier one because it was new for all of us um but lockdown hit pretty hard and fast we were forced to close the cocktail bar we had about 15 full-time bar staff at the time which who all of all of a sudden had no job we then made the decision to move them down to the warehouse in banks meta in an attempt to keep everyone in a job we didn't really know how but that's what we did and then at the same time we started to see all the shortages of a lot of products but specific to what we could manufacture hand sanitizer and over the course of about a week we decided to make the switch to commit all of our production at that time to for me it was the week before my wife gave birth to our first our first child a little little girl called maddie so it was an intense week for me personally but um we managed to make the switch we were about the first distillery in the country to do so we ended up producing over 100 000 bottles of hand sanitizer for consumers um bars retail we sent some to the state government um some of the sort of frontline service workers um woolies and you know it was a great move for us that I mean to be honest there's no money in it but at least it keeps everyone working and and covers some of your costs um but it was also really good to just support everyone at that time you know business-wise it's challenging because what happens for us is you know you lose all your duty free sales to airports because they're all closed you lose all your bar revenue we lost about 750 grand worth of events sales that were in the pipeline all the events got cancelled all us we had a boost in direct web sales and also sales to bottle shops which to some degree helped offset that but it was it was a quick transition and I think in 2020 one the challenge was almost more significant in a sense because everyone knew how to adapt and you know we sort of adapted in the same way whereby we brought the bar stuff down to the warehouse again but there was no hand sanitizer option so that uh you know that meant that we just had this whole with all the same revenue drops across the channels that were closed being you know duty-free and hospitality and events and all those sorts of things and we had to figure out alternative ways to to keep the business going and you know not have too big a drop um and I think in 2021 one of the interesting things that we've seen is the the uptick in in virtual events particularly for corporates most businesses I mean like ours everyone except our production and operations staff are working from home and so we had a virtually and we've done hundreds and hundreds of blend your own gin classes whiskey tastings gin tastings um at a wrap cocktail classes where you make cocktails at home um virtually whereby we send kits out to uh to all the attendees in advance and they receive it and we have an ambassador online you know on zoom or teams or whatever your virtual meeting hub of choices um and run through it at home and they've been really really successful um and so look in summary you know there's a lot more that I could go into but conscious of time both lockdowns have been really really difficult in the scheme of things I consider us incredibly lucky you know we're we're a food and beverage manufacturing business we're still able to trade um we were able to keep all of our staff employed and actually over this lockdown I think we increased our head count by about a dozen staff um and it's definitely been challenging and it's definitely been a hit to specific areas of the business but as're able to react quickly and you know we've got a team that's super committed and and you know really has put in some hard work to be able to take advantage of the the opportunities that do exist but they're few and far between and they require a big shift in your operating model to actually make the most of it um and you know supported by the new site down here in banks meadow there's no chance we could have done this if we were back at rosebury we just didn't have the space we didn't have the setup and so it's fantastic to be down here so you look I hope that gives you a little bit of insight into how we we manage both lockdowns um they've definitely been challenging but I consider us really lucky as I said and we've been able to keep our whole team employed and can't wait to get out of it start seeing people in person and hopefully doing things like this face to face in the future so thank in the rosebury area drop into the the venue you can have some takeaway cocktails in the interim and then when we open the bar you can have a drink um and you can look out for our products on on bottle shop shelves or on the website thanks guys really appreciate it see you later thank you what a great story and I'm sure there's many other success stories out there now I'd like to invite john quick um council relationship manager with service new south wales business to say a few words over to you john I thank you very much deputy mayor and I'll begin by uh saying thank you to the mayor the deputy mayor the ministers and and obviously bayside council for the opportunity to to come along tonight um as council relationship manager we service new south wales for business uh I make myself readily available and the minister was correct we have formed a bit of a tag team and I'm here to attest to the fact that he he's made himself available to attend as many to see so I'll just gonna share my screen and just a presentation that I'll run through uh just talking a little about how service new south wales for business does um support business so everyone can see the screen there in one second there we go okay so um covert 19 support packages for business and and I'll just talk a little bit about what service new south wales for business actually does and um you know service new south wales for business makes it easier for businesses by connecting them to what they need to start run adapt recover and prosper and um and and service new south wales for business provides a one front door for businesses to access new south wales government services information and financial support we provide a suite of digital tools to access transactions across government including licenses and for those many businesses that have signed up with a business profile and using that they can access their licenses and applications and so forth we provide 24-hour telephone support we also provide tailored case management to support businesses through our in the world that will we'll hopefully sooner rather than later come emerge into where we'll help businesses who who do want to start up and need that advice and support we provide information on services across local state and federal government and we have staff right across the state across the six regions we have a team of business concierges and crms like myself that number has grown exponentially as a result of covert as we've brought on more people from across agencies and and hired people who may have have experience in business but have unfortunately been made redundant who've come on board again with that business experience and knowledge to support so just in the metro south region that I look after I now have something like 22 23 business concierges mobile and and office based to provide to answer phones and to provide that online support over the past three years service new south wales for business has rapidly expanded our customer base starting with a small base of about 50 customers to now having more than 240 business concierge customers that the business concierge we provide support and information like I said through the business concierge team they're people who have experience in business who are there to to answer the phones but also pound the pavement and provide that personalized face-to-face support to small business businesses can reach us and book a call back through our website to get a call back from a business concierge and who can then provide that support and in particular as the minister said in the shadow minister said there have been some some um initial teething problems and issues with long wait times but I can assure you that those wait times have been addressed by literally bringing on several hundred additional staff from across agencies and from service centers and other parts of the department of customer service to answer those phones and I can attest to the fact that even today uh through a good portion of the day there was a zero wait time on on the phone the online business profile that's available to give business customers gives them visibility of applications like dine and discover the applications now as the minister said um and he has stressed this at every forum when it comes to this the support grants there we there are so many businesses out there who have applied for the grants but yet there are some who for whatever reason have considered themselves or self-assessed uh themselves and consider themselves ineligible for any of the grants and I can't say stress it strongly enough that that you should go online check out the website look at the grants and complete that two-minute question questionnaire that will lift out highlight the benefits that are available but also highlight which grants that you may be eligible for to touch again on the grants that we provide the business grant which was to cover the first three weeks of lockdown which started at 26th of june and was rolled out by the new south wales state government to cover that three weeks to 17th of july with anticipation that that would be the extent of the lockdown but obviously with the extension we've had to implement other grants to continue to support businesses the turnover of 30 to 75 000 and it also covers sole traders not employing businesses who who may not have employees but fit into that turnover category likewise the job saver program which provides that ongoing fortnightly payment equal to 40 of your weekly payroll also available for non-employing businesses and not-for-profits_-RRB-_2440.72 where they can receive a thousand dollars a week and the job saver plus hospitality which has been the extension again covering 40 of pre-covered payroll up to five hundred thousand dollars per week now uh one thing I do want to stress with these with these grants uh for for job saver business grants and the hospitality they are available to employ to businesses who have where the employees of those businesses may be eligible for the commonwealth disaster payment so if you're a small business owner who is listed on your bas or your w1 as an employee the business could be eligible for the business grant but you as an employee along with your staff may be eligible for the commonwealth disaster payment as well now in the interest of time I'm not grants I have a little bit of a snapshot here but I would advise that that businesses visit those websites on service new south wales look at the grant comparisons and read the at the application landing page and the guidelines get advice from the accountant or financial planner or call up 1377.88 to speak to a business concierge who can then provide guidance on what you may be eligible for but the key thing is to get that application in likewise with job saver and micro business grant there's a lot of detail in there and a lot more on the website to provide you that guidance as to eligibility now to date in the bayside council I can report that there's been over 10 200 applications from small businesses in this local government area and to date as of today we've paid out about 124 million dollars across those three grants and we still have about 350 odd applications in the system currently being processed and assessed and with the view to to reduce the the time that it takes to apply but I absolutely a whole cohort of small businesses out there who have not applied and as time has progressed with these grants the eligibility criteria has widened with the view to capture more small businesses who may not have been eligible when the grants were initially rolled out but we have listened to feedback from the constituents from local business chambers from our small businesses to expand where possible to capture more eligibility with a view to providing more financial support and again as the minister talked about as we come out of lockdown you know we there's a raft of of supports grants and and initiatives that are currently existing but that will be rolled out as well accommodation support grant to for accommodation providers that will launch in late september providing grants for those businesses who have lost room nights the dine and discover program which was rolled out to to re to kickstart the economy as we came out of the first lockdown uh obviously uh unforeseen the covert lockdown that we're currently in but that has now been extended to 30th of june okay stay and providers in the city of sydney with a view that that may be expanded to other areas as well and you're encouraged to register now if you fit into that category so that when the law the scheme launches that uh we can contact you further support small business fees and charges the 1500 rebate to to help cover the cost of state government fees and charges that's still ongoing um and that is open until the end of june 2022 so again I encourage small businesses to to apply for that again payroll tax support in reductions in the 2022 payroll tax for eligible businesses support with business tenancy through the small business commissioner and again access that advice through service new south wales and then we can then transfer you through to the small business commissioner if needed the test and isolate so workers in affected lgas providing advice there as well as if you're eligible workers who live in the affected lga can apply for a one-off payment of 320 dollars if you meet the criteria as well as providing free mental health support businesses as the effect of lockdowns and the extensions the uncertainty that mental health and wellbeing is a critical component and we're here to provide that support through safe work new south wales as well as other means qr codes is obviously something that is front of mind and we here again provide food service new south wales guidance on how to register a covert safety plan and to meet the requirements as per your industry around qr codes and enabling customers to check in including those that may not have a smartphone we now can provide a hard copy plastic card with a qr code that then they can present to the business premise that they're trying to enter and that can be scanned and that will have those details which were retained by the department of health for contact tracing purposes for no more than 28 days and and finally I would encourage people both individuals and businesses to visit the surface new south wales website and look for in particular covert 19 help for business and as you can see from the screen here it personalized support help with your employees and apprentices tenancies landlords events and webinars case studies training links to grants loans and financial assistance and most importantly mental health and wellbeing which will then put you give you the contact details with beyondblue and other organizations that are there to support you thank you and with that you know I just want to really reiterate that myself and the team out here at service new south wales for business are here we are listening and we are really dedicated to support providing the support and advice that's necessary and and we will continue to work with the business community and with the council and local chambers ongoing as we go through that recovery and that exciting time which which hopefully will be sooner rather than later and we can all get back to business recognizing that small business is the absolute backbone of the new south wales economy so with that I'll hand back to james thank you john I'm very I'm sure many of our listeners will have found that very informative our last

my business in 2000 and I turned to the bec for assistance and they're very helpful so thank you a lot of a lot of information great information has been shared and I'm sure will be very helpful to local businesses um now we come to the questions and answer segment thank you all for sending in your questions uh we have calen um collated uh the questions and I will try to get through them as many as possible I will start with the selection of questions that best represent the main points of concern so what I'm going to do just um let the person know who's going to answer it and ask the question the first question is for the minister um graham from ramsgate has asked will unvaccinated people be able to dine in when clear the premiere has made it uh abundantly uh the case that when we reach 70 uh the freedoms which will be made available to people will only be for those who are double vaccinated now um as I indicated earlier the customer service is as indicated there will be a range of uh options for people to be able to demonstrate that they are double vaccinated but in that period uh from mid october when we do hit that 70 range the only um people will be who will be able to avail themselves of those freedoms are the people who have had that double vaccinated certificate that they and can demonstrate that they are double vaccinated great thank you minister the next question is also for you um I own a school cafe who will be responsible to verify on customer vaccination status before I serve them yeah and again that's a really good question which we're working through at the moment you know and I'm not probably giving much weight here but I i just put that put it in this perspective every plan a covered safe plan for a 300 a hotel that can accommodate 300 people at a cafe that has you know 10 tables will be different and the obligations on those businesses will clearly be different so the first thing that I would be saying to businesses when they reopen and they should be doing this now is working out a covered safe plan for the manner in which they open their business one of the things that they have to take into account is the fact that the business is only open for vaccinated people now um everyone may well recall that at the time we opened up after the last wave of the pandemic we had things like covet marshals we had people who had sanitization desks almost or a desk where you can be sanitised you had marks on the floor where people would stand and they like every business adopted it according to themselves people ask me this though well why are you asking me to establish whether someone is vaccinated what the obligation is not for you necessarily to have to make sure is have a system which has a qr code potentially that qr code will also have vaccination status and you will be required to do what a reasonable business the size of your business is for the purposes of ensuring you comply with the public health order now I stress the word reasonableness no one is asking a business owner to act as a police officer no one will be asking you to run around and have confrontations with customers as to their vaccination status the obligation on you will be what is reasonable and it might be reasonable to have a a small sign at the door or whatever it is you can only access this business if you are vaccinated in those circumstances that might be the test in my experience as a lawyer reasonableness and what is reasonably required of someone was generally the ultimate test of whether someone had any liability or the like and as I started by saying uh an owner of a of a hotel with 300 or had capacity for 300 patient patrons is different from a small takeaway cafe with 5 time but what I encourage people to do is make sure that they have a coded safe plan uh and and create a circumstances where they make known to their customers that the uh opportunity to enter those premises is only open to vaccinated people and do not ask your staff to act as police officers that is not incumbent upon them I can cannot envisage how stressful it would be to have a 17 year old shop assistant confront uh you know a 20 stone customer who refuses to demonstrate uh vaccinations that's not your their job and you should not expect them to do it and it would be unreasonable to do it so we will make over the next few weeks we will make that a lot clearer in terms of guidelines about opening your business but I think the standard you would be starting to think about is what is reasonable great thank you minister uh the next question is for john uh my business normally only turns over approximately 50k is there any assistance for me yes absolutely so the micro business grant is 30 000 and 75 000 now it's a fortnightly tax-free grant it applies from the 26th of june or from whichever fortnight that business nominates that they have first experienced that decline in turnover after the 26th of june so once those eligible businesses have applied you'll need to nominate that two week period and then uh approved the payments will actually begin um from the start of that nominated for fortnight and those payments will be made in arrears or backdated to absolutely thank you john the next question I have is for the mayor um it's from brad from mascot who wants to know what incentives council has for construction projects the mayor is on mute yeah uh mr mayor can you hear me now we got you get up can you hear me yep sure do sorry I've had it on mute there yeah look thank you uh james good question from brad I guess the construction industry is one of bayside's largest employers so it's important for our community to keep this sector going now council if you recall um of december 2021 and we have also a residential development application fee where the value of the project is less than a hundred thousand this will speed up the process and hopefully pass on saving to the construction projects thank you mr mayor um the next question I have is for the minister again um I rent a shop and I'm worried my landlord may evict me what are my rights well um thanks for that question um first and foremost I'd say that in the current under the national code your landlord can't evict you secondly I would say that you a landlord must take steps to negotiate with you in relation to a reduction in rent by way of waiver or deferral depending upon the amount that your business has been impacted and thirdly I would say is that the landlord is obliged to mediate an outcome with the small business commissioner in circumstances where no agreement can be directly reached with your landlord so three things in relation to the question there's a short answer no but secondly there are benefits of seeking'd say this about the small business commissioner he has a significant uh staff conducting mediations and 90 of those mediations reach an outcome there will be some which don't reach an outcome and they get certificates which allow them to ventilate their differences elsewhere but it is a significantly good service which is available and there's a website which you would go to um that's uh www.smallbusiness.nsw.gov.iu and they that is a bit of a diamond that the government has to assist small business which is not available itself of enough and the small business commissioner really does have a significant input into government policy and into mediation services which it might which he makes available to small businesses great thank you minister uh the next question I have is for um the member for rockdale mr steve camper I have a local restaurant do I have to ensure all my employees are vaccinated and do I have to record that information sorry can you hear me yep yep these are the settings that I spoke about earlier um I think I think we need direction what what the settings are going to be after the 15th of october what what I did say earlier was that what we need is surety we need uh we need a situation where uh employers actually uh have defined rules uh where that can assist them from uh protect them from risk uh at this stage it looks like they're going to have to uh insist on their employees to be vast they've had both both um both chaps uh and uh and same with their customers so uh you know I think the minister's best to advise us as to whether that is going to be the case but it looks to be the case said for at least for a period of time that period of time could be you know months that's yet to be defined but it looks like it is heading that way thank you steve so if I can just add uh in relation to that steve's a 100 right here that businesses do need some certainty in relation to that there will be different rules which vaccination rates uh and the like and then a different rules will come into a blow into um into play after 80 I notice in the chat forum or in the chat bar there are people who take the view that the requirement for double vaccination um amounts to some form of discrimination slash cruelty while I can understand that sentiment I do say this that the opening up of the economy is predicated upon making sure that the health system can cope with any further outbreak of this pandemic the last thing that small business needs is to be locked down again so the gradual re-opening to the vaccinated who place a very limited threat to the health system is is designed to make sure that we do not lock small businesses down again and that's got to be the priority from everyone I would have thought on this calls um on this webinar is to make sure that when we do this again when we open again you're not going to lock us down again and that's the message we get loud and clear so about the requirement to be double vaccinated there is a basis for science for doing that and that's to make sure that we gradually get through this process in circumstances where the health system can cope and we do not ask businesses to shut down again if if I could just further out there mister I i mean that's that that's that's another big issue is what what happens if a business uh has got people that are infected and what are the shutdown requirements for a period for what period of time what are the procedures all of these things all of these things have to be addressed because you know one thing that um business needs is surety and uh we need business confidence to for this economy to power back up so uh if if a business is uh is a lot of business people that I've spoken to have said look you know we need to know what happens if we do get an infection run you know one of the employees or a customer infects uh employees or whatever through staff how do we how do we what's the process how do we work through that and these are the things that what we're going to be relying on the government to provide us uh detail on in the very very near future it's extremely important that the business community knows what the terms of engagement are and what are the consequences of an infection as well in that reopening period thanks and don't worry steve I will talk to you or we will share we will share views thank you guys okay the next question I got is for louise and I i know louise you've probably answered this before um in your presentation but who can access the bec digital solution program and how much does it cost it's a basically any business um based in new south wales or in act that hasn't previously accessed the so-called asbas program is eligible um to access it for free at the moment so yeah and there will be a cost further down the road but even if um if that cost does to be 44 which is not bad for seven hours thank you louise um the next question I have is for the minister again will the vaccine vaccinated customers be required to sit indoors and the unvaccinated outdoors um well well there's no provision at the moment for there may that may be a consideration after 80 percent but for um for the 70 mark it'll be only uh double vaccinated customers that will be allowed into the premises however it does play into this scenario and I'm sure the mayor has already indicated in relation to this the assistance which local government has provided for development applications to be able to encourage more outdoor dining and the like as part of the recovery process and I i must say that I applaud those sort of initiatives because the opportunity for businesses in the summer time going forward and to make sure that they we increase the opportunity for social distancing and the like is increased by more flexible uh approaches toward the way the business operates so the question is a good one well I encourage get past 80 um uh I would like to think that we will reach a stage where um the the vaccination status of people is irrelevant uh hopefully masks become irrelevant all those things and the freedoms which we all want uh will become a thing of the past but it really is so dependent upon getting vaccination rates up there are those who call that that coercion and the like I i don't like I like to think that it is part of our social responsibility that we assist each other by getting vaccination rates up as high as possible so that we support the reopening of business thank you minister uh the next question I have is for the general manager meredith wallace uh cath from sansuzi asked council has been waiving uh my footpath trading fees how long will this continue uh thank you cats for that question so at this time council has agreed to continue to waive the footway trading fees until the end of this year so that's the 31st of december 2021 where like all of the the things that council will help your business when you reopen and help you on that road to recovery to provide a safe environment for you and your staff thank you kath thank you meredith um now I noticed there's many questions coming through and I know we're going to have trouble getting through all of them but please rest assure that these questions will be on the website in the next few days um answered um all right the next question I have is for uh john I'm a sole trader my business income has reduced by 50 I don't know how much longer I can sustain my business am I eligible for any assistance yeah thank you for that question yeah look sole traders and non-employing businesses may be eligible for the grants again depending on the size and turnover the business so micro business grant if you're between 30 and 75 dollars you may be eligible for that fortnightly payment of fifteen hundred dollars the caveat being that if you have deemed yourself as as an individual who has applied for the commonwealth disaster payment then business grant making note though that the payment amounts are exactly the same 750 per week if for the commonwealth grant payment if if you've lost more than 20 hours a week micro business grant is fifteen hundred dollars per fortnight now for those larger sole traders you again may be eligible for the business grant if your turnover is um is uh between 75 and 50 000 and for job saver a sole trader uh would maybe eligible for up to a thousand dollars a week if you meet that eligibility criteria great thank you john um the next question is for the minister what is going to happen with the business support once we open up will it continue what will it be and what will it look like again it's a it's a a thing which is a grant which is under consideration the treasurer has made it very clear that uh we are not going to just walk away from our responsibilities in terms of making sure the business has survived so the short answer will be that it will survive the grants targeted towards specific businesses which will struggle to get up and going but those businesses which remain impacted businesses who can demonstrate their continuing decline then in those circumstances assistance will continue to be available we will of course and this is uh there are obligations on all governments to do this if we are paying money out we are an obligation to make sure that it's going to people who are entitled to that money so there will be obligations on business to continue to certify that they are impacted there was some fuss in relation to to that when we notified businesses that we had got we wanted them again to recertify that that they were impacted that will be ongoing it is it is worth noting that the government as it has spent uh in support of small businesses 3.3 billion dollars since the beginning of the of the pandemic and I think there are nearly 400 000 businesses which are now receiving assistance from the government so the obligation is there to continue that assistance so as long as possible that we can ascertain grants will continue to be available thank you minister I've probably only got time for another two questions so the next question I have is for uh mr steve campbell the shadow investor um how do you think the businesses of our community are coping under this pressure giving them multicultural nature of our community is there any further assistance you would suggest look I i think all most the business community has really struggled through this period there have been some that have you know been able to to keep afloat to some degree especially some some of the uh food establishments got food established where they've been able to run um run take away but again that has been nowhere near the turnover that they that they had had before this lockdown it's been extremely tough I think we need to start looking at targeting the what the higher impact of business I think the minister alluded to that earlier that's that that's extremely important unfortunately when you roll out this type of these types of packages you try and cover as many that um mr net but uh I personally think that we need to continue with the job saver I don't know whether we need to be too harsh in terms of um uh continuing to pay people even some that have gone over 70 of their previous turnover they're still trying to recover I think the government needs to to pay specific attention to that because a lot of them are lost 100 percent of turnover because they've just gone back over to 71. you can't just say they've recovered and we're not there for them one of the biggest uh criticisms of the start was a job people in the job keeper continued to pay a lot of businesses in in during the recovery period now admit admittedly there were some big entertainment got paid but they shouldn't have gotten paid uh um many have been shamed in the payment back but for a lot of the smaller business community it rely it will rely on continued support because our job here is to try and make sure that not one business it's really important that we focus on that and uh and um I'm I'm sure the ministers are quite aware of that too so they haven't set the set the rules yet they haven't uh properly um established what the support will look like but uh I think we need to consider there's a lot of small business that may jump up for a period of time but you've got to remember they've suffered for a long time with and many of them with zero income thank you steve I've got time for one more question and that'll be for the minister am I required to give my employees time off to get tested and vaccinated or isolated if required um well difficult question depending upon the particular status of the employee if in fact someone needs to be tested uh there is a support grant which is available uh why they can can take that time off however if they are sick they are entitled to sick leave as part of going and getting tested however if it arises in their business or has come into their premises who may uh be covert positive uh I would anticipate that that person would be entitled to a covert um john may recall that john what's the name of that grant where uh people take time off work for the purposes of getting uh oh you've caught me you've put me on the spot there and I just can't give it off the top of that yeah well that's okay but there is there is a support payment a covert support payment available in relation to people who need to take time off work because they have had to go and get tested or have been exposed to someone who may be positive in their business during the period when you reopen all right thank you minister well that wraps up our question in the answer session um thank you again to our panel um the minister should hope uh shut up minister steve camper mayor joel wada john quirkins service new south wales business and louise braun from bayside bc thank you for the time chat room and

Thank you alison for that lovely introduction I can hardly wait to hear myself talk after that I will start by saying that well hope we have some fun today and learn a few things about the local area and probably dig up a few memories for you I think probably the best thing to do now is to get started I hope you enjoy and I'll look forward to questions at the end of the session so alison is going to put up some images for us to talk about the first one that I'd like to discuss is the old title bars at san souzi and coming up on the screen there it is it's uh a photograph that was taken in 1935 for the kogura jubilee booklet and at the time this photograph was taken the council was particularly proud of this area you can see the baths in the foreground and in the immediate background some picnic shelters which look very very elegant and very enticing and going further across to the right hand side you can see a sandstone wall a retaining to delaney's boat shed and and just immediately in front of that is the punt grant that land that we can see there the park san sisi park was reclaimed by um dredgers the wall was built and then the sand and shells were dredged from the bottom of the river the georgia's river and deposited in the park the park was built up that way though the trees as you can see on the left-hand side in the background there they formed the original shoreline so that that land there has all been reclaimed was all reclaimed in 1932-33 and the park was opened uh at the same time a very very modern uh bathing pavilion was built at the at the bars which we'll see in a moment or two but those those bars are the second ones on on that site there was a um some baths there prior to this time but the 3233 they were rebuilt and this was a very important part of the playground of the south so if we can have the next slide pass on the other side are right at the the point of the census near the olympic pool this this set of baths was on the sandringham side uh there's still bars there right now but there's no boat shed there anymore the boat shed the original boat shed for here was was built in 1903. this particular one was the one that was owned by frank ward in the in the 1950s um the baths were remade at that time as well and this these bars look right out and directly at the um their heads at la peru's and connell so it was a beautiful place to have a swim you could enjoy the refreshment rooms that were attached to the boatshed you could hire a boat either a motorboat or a road boat and enjoy yourself on george's river so this is also this was called pilgrims baths most people uh in recent times have known it as pilgrims uh it was owned by in 1903 by fred shellman who was the son of amos sillman and amos solomon was one of the great pioneers of the the time when uh there was nothing even remotely like this there were no houses amos salman had a house in what was to become clearville avenue but his house was simply in the bush so this particular bathing and boating site plays a very important part in the history of our peninsula I think that we can probably go on to the next one now if we can and this is an image of the same boat shed the one that we were just looking at at least it was on the same site but this is the the original one that amos selman built for his son fred selma you know and it goes back to this is the one that goes right back to 1903. I love this photograph and I think it's it's a very charming photograph of its times it shows a sort of a bush setting that the uh butt sheds and and baths were surrounded by you can see a very small norfolk island pine there but we know now that those norfolk island pines at stantingham are huge and uh planted for by amos selman for fred selman's uh birth to commemorate his birth and it's still there and it's an enormous uh enormous noise tree you can see refreshments are available you can see oysters are available um they had cold drinks there ice and this particular boat shed at sandingham was very close to the prince of wales hotel which we'll see a bit later on this morning and people that visited the prince of wales hotel were also surrounded by a picnic ground and pleasure ground and that extended right across the park to this boat shed so it was a part of the complex and a very very successful business for quite a long time we can go on now if we like to something very important and that's the cover of my book the book this book was published in 2015. you can see the title uh baths and boat sheds the waterfront community at san susie 1895 to 1965 and I chose to put on the cover of the book the um the bathing pavilion that I was talking baiting for building for 1933 was a very very modern piece of architecture it was something that was um original that style I should say was originated in california was called modern it was part of the art deco movement art deco was involved with painting and glass making and so on but also with architecture and this building was built with on the premise that uh the horizontal lines which should prevail you can you can see that you can pick that up very quickly in in the in the building to the right of the the building is a wonderful morton bay fig which is still there unfortunately that bathing pavilion was knocked down in the last few months demolished it had concrete cancer it hadn't been used really since the 1960s anyway and so it was deemed by the council to be unfit for development or occupation and it no longer exists I'm pleased to say however that the the moreton bay victory does still stand and it will serve as a reminder always of the um the placement of the original san seussian bars image we looked at today when we were looking towards this to the towards the east from this baths showed the surrounds this one uh shows the baths themselves right in the in the foreground you can see uh two prongs sticking up there's a walkway there and those are the handles of a ladder I remember those well because my sisters taught me to swim at these bars and their method of teaching was pretty primitive they just threw me in the water and hoped that I would scramble back to the steps to those those uh steps there so they take an important place in my life just one second sorry my phone was ringing um yeah and I've overlaid that with the image of a boat shed which you can see in the bottom right hand corner of that picture that boat shed we'll talk about in a minute because that that is a particularly important photograph as well in in the history of san souza but I i can't stress enough how important uh this image is and and the book I want to buy the book it's there's uh 140 pages a4 pages it's 30 dollars and you can buy it by just sending me an email gary garydarby.com so um I hope you enjoyed the talk and if you want to go further with it and delve into a lot more detailed information particularly about the baths and boat tents of saint susie uh general census history this is the book to have that's a pretty good commercial I think we should perhaps go on to the next image this um this boat shed a very uh I think a wonderful style boat shed was built by a man called peter john bellman and peter bellman was a master mariner he came from germany and um he was he worked as a mariner before he settled down at census he lived at saint susie and he opened this boat shed before the first census baths were open in fact he he peter bellman had a hand in the construction of the bars they were made by the three peters peter bellman peter moore who had the gardener and an emirate so this the bars became known as the three petersburgs and peter john bellman was one of the peters I'm not sure whether that's him with the rifle over his shoulder but you can see how rural things were in that time he was probably out shooting kangaroos or something but you could have at his bars also there were oysters and uh we stressed this because oysters were part of the holiday atmosphere of the place people came down to the peninsula deliberately to dubai and to eat oysters you can see the word summer drinks on the on the front of the boat and you can also see the owner's name pj bellman just after the word shed I hope everybody can make that out this um this particular shed was important to a group of aboriginal people who lived around in cobra bay or the least they camped around in coca bay and these um these folks were workers on the halt estate which is on the other side of the river in the background of that photograph and they them used to walk around from cobra bay uh on an occasional day and wait here for people that had come down the rocky point road and people that had come down and wanted to go across to the other side the aboriginal people would raise them across for a shilling and return to the important part of the area we should move on I think we'll run out of time today we'll go now to yet another boat ted this is one owned by george hughes to choose a very important man in the area you can see on the face of that building some george sailing club and the date at the top looks like 1924 but it's that's a whoever wrote that got the year wrong it's 1927 and in 1927 this became the first clubhouse that's in george sailing club so part of the leisure activities of the area was sailing and this this building is stood right close to that huge moreton bay fig which you can see on the right of the photograph and you can also see a steamer called the ss arena you can see that tied up to the there was a wharf beside the bath and the aaron is tied up there taking on passengers the she would take passengers out to kernel or la perez or to brighton on a circular run and and the owner thomas charles did that for some 25 years it was part of the leisure uh attractions for the area people would come down to take a steamer ride around the bay or follow the ceiling we can go now to the next image if we can this is another book that I had a small hand in and you can see at the bottom by lube one with with myself memories of aquaflora park I don't think there's anybody old enough watching today to remember aquaflora because um it it finished in 1956. so we might we might get a few people in the this was run by a man called albert royce who formerly had owned a milk bar and chocolate factory out in the western suburbs but he lived in san souzi at zoo and in the end he had a zoo which not only included animals but included 50 goldfish ponds uh he had orchids there royce was a prominent orchid grower he had a wonderful little cafe there which sold a memorable scones with jam and cream there were kangaroos native birds monkeys and and you name it um this this park aquaflora park was situated on the corner of clearwell avenue and ida street for those of you know the san jose it's not there now but the um census utah minding building is is on the site of aquaflora park in 1935 two years after this opened international visitors came to sydney on a ship called the franconia and one of them was the songwriter cole porter and carl porter remembered coming out to aquaflora park at san tsuji spectacular spectacular place you can see here the larger gulf put the goldfish ponds there in the center we'll move along if we can to the next image which is we're going pretty well this is the clearville hall which was before aquaflora park was built this and it says there the largest seaside pleasure grounds out of sydney and this was in a very prominent spot right in the middle of the san circe peninsula the cleveland hall was demolished in the 1930s unfortunately but it was a great place for people to to go and take a picnic or play cricket large companies met there and that hall believe it or not was said to hold 500 people they had dances and um and all sorts of things in that hall sorts of meetings I should say so clearville hall was an important part of um fantasy and very prominent in cleveland avenue we can go to the next if we can the next image is this one well this is sorry this is the cleveland uh picnic grounds which was stood behind that building we're just looking at it's a photograph by joseph frankenstein who was a very prominent local photographer but you can see that that area was steeped in things to keep people happy so now we can go to the next shot if we if we could we're lady uh apprehensive young lady I should say treating the kangaroo having a new experience and protective father looking on but that just gives you a context shot of what aquaflora park was all about we'll go to the next one it's enjoyed sailing club this is the building from 1932 a lot of kansas locals will know that there was um uh this is the second or the third actually uh uh sailing club and um sorry the second the third one has just been demolished to make way for the fourth one and there's a force in george sailing club going up at the moment this is the 1932 building but in the background excuse me the photograph must have been taken about 1964 or five in the background you could see the beginnings of the captain cook bridge which gives you a good sense of exactly where that photograph's taken so the next while we're talking about sailing and we'd be remiss not to mention billow hayward in the top right hand corner of that picture is billow hayward who was's river and botany bay and and indeed uh billow hayward won the world 18-foot sailing championship in auckland in uh in 1946 he won 17 uh some george sailing club championships and numerous other championships he was unbeatable on the bay I was back into a lot I used to sail a little bit myself but I was talking to people who knew below haywood and saw with him and they say that he could have rigged up a bathtub with a bed sheet and still beating most of the boats on the bay he was that good he got his knowledge from uh being a um an oyster farmer he knew all about the tides and the currents and the winds and uh he had a small amount of aboriginal heritage which probably worked in his favour in terms of communicating with nature he was a great part of leisure and pleasure on time tuesday and you can see his boat neptune 6 there skimming along a great speed so go to the next one if we can this is the wonderful um prince of wales hotel it prince of wales hotel was on this site in 1868 1868 that's going well back it was well before there were any decent roads in the area and people used to come by horse and cart from sydney to come down here to these picnic grounds you can see the words hotel and picnic ground sandringham written on the bottom of the photograph and they're the extensive photographer sorry extensive picnic grounds that I was talking about previously uh you can see the norfolk island pines in the background here and just out of shot on the left of this picture is the selman boat shed so you can see how close that was this is the hotel that eventually morphed into mick moreland and for any saint susie residents well from people from a long way away for that matter knew about bit more so if we can go to the next slide please this is the beer garden rough and ready as it is pine trees in the background the old prince of wales hotel or part of it anyway you can see on the these beer glasses and you can see a sign there right in the middle of the picture uh stolen glasses 20 pound fine he got so tired of having the beer glasses stolen that he decided that he would find anybody that stole 120 pounds which was an enormous amount of money in the 1950s and 60s that that structure I won't call it a building but on the left side of that building was the beer garden they had a dirt floor with tables pretty rough table and and that's where a lot of the activity took place in nick's hotel that's on the outside we'll have a look at the inside now if we can this is the um the infamous six o'clock swirl I don't know whether people have read about this or not but there was a law passed that hotels needed to close at six o'clock so those taps in the background were drinking as many skinners abuse as they could before six o'clock and mick was famous for this this time you can see that's got eight shillings and two pins on the on the screen and that's before decimal currency of course mick moreland bought this hotel in 1952 offered carrie to call lousy liz richie and that people knew that hotel from that day so just to give you an insight into the inside of the famous mcmillans can we go through then to um let's see uh number 16 on my list the punt and bridge you might have to skip through a few no just keep going oh that's good that's good that's a bridge uh the bridge captain cook bridge in progress in 1964 and in the foreground is the punt which had run from 1916 to that time it finished in 1965 there is communication or transport I should say in the san jose area can we go to the next one please steam trams ran along rocky point road between 1887 and 1937. this is going up fitzgerald phil barton street in the background we go to the next chances that the trams went around a great loop in the uh in known as the loop and I'd like to finish on the next slide I think oh no sorry we're just one this is the trolley bus and uh trams the trolley bus is taking over from the trams in 1937 and right in the middle of congress steam tram on the right the new electric trolley buses on the left and the next yeah final slide uh the loop this is by joseph brackenshire and I think it's a delightful picture the little girl's in the uh in the middle of the picture there the little girl on the left is the photographer's daughter I happen to have the pleasure of interviewing her in 1988 when she was an old lady and she told me that her father the photographer had asked her to stand there with a friend and not move stand stand like a statue until the tram came along so joseph brackenshire a very very very uh accomplished photographer just clicked the chatter right at the right moment and he captured something of the great joys and pleasures of saint susie so to alison

Now um commence the q a session thank you for all sending in your questions we have uh collated the questions and I will try to get through them in as many as possible I will start with selection of questions that best represent the main points and the first question which I'd like to direct to new south wales health is um uh can you explain the five kilometer rule is it from the address where you live or five kilometers from our lga for example I live in mascot five kilometers from my home can take me to two other local government areas while five kilometers cannot get me to the other side of the lga of dolls point yes so you can hear me up here yep yeah so in within bayside you must obtain your goods and services within five kilometers of your home uh so if that does mean that it's in a different lga that is okay um and you may only exercise within five kilometers of your home so um it's not so much the lga boundaries that are important the next question I've got is directed to the mayor and it's from sophie and bexley how do I know where the base of the boundaries are thank you james with the boundaries I mean what we've done we've had this question from a number of community members to make the boundaries very clear we've published a map specifically for this purpose on our website so I'll just remind our community if you go on the website bayside.nsw.gov dot a u we do have specifically uh a map for that so that'll give you the boundaries great thank you mr man question three is um I'm a widow and my son lives in a different lga further than five kilometers can he visit me and can you define the carer's restrictions if I could put that over to you dr shepard please yeah so um the the um the declared area doesn't really make any difference to whether your son can visit um so if he you could be his uh not he could be your nominated um single bubble that um if it's a care and compassion visit so um they're looking at in either of those ways um then your son is able to visit um using one of those mechanisms great thank you dr shepard um question four if I can direct this to inspector holiday I still see people gathering on levels playing soccer and chatting in groups what do I do and why is this still allowed when we are trying to do the right thing oh thanks for that obviously a lot that behavior is actually not allowed and there's also a restriction on recreation within the lga in those circumstances if you see people doing the wrong thing you're very welcome in the ring mascot police station or cogwood police station that's your local police stations or of course crime stoppers long wait 1-800 triple three triple zero thank you inspector holiday um question five um if I can direct us to new south wales health um I work out of the of our lga do I need to get tested every three days to go to work apply to bayside it only applies to three local government areas not not this one okay thank you um the next question if I can direct to the mayor it's a question from uh damian from rockdale what financial relief has council put in place for residents uh thank you deputy look council has put in the place a number a number of measures uh and fee waivers to assist our community I mean I'd like to just quickly uh point out a few just list a few um throughout this pandemic we've got zero percentage interest rate on overdue rates and annual charges and that goes until the 31st of december 2021. we've also got wave of interest on late payments so if you if you pay your rates late for rate payers who enter into a payment plan prior to the 1st of january 2022. so you've got to apply for the uh for the waiver for the interest rate what we've also done full rental waiver for the period of the public health order or the 31st of december 2021 whichever to operate their business due to the current restrictions um full rental waiver for community tenants um of council facilities until the end of the year also 31st december 2021 and then wave and a refund uh for ground ife for all by bayside community sporting clubs because as we know sport has not been possible uh as far as soccer clubs and other clubs with uh seasonal booking until the 30th of october 2021 I'd like to also mention waiver fee and charges for outdoor dining licenses footpath trading fees library overview fees work zone permit fees and fees for residential development application with a development value of less than a hundred thousand so helping those do a renovation I'd like to quickly mention in addition to these uh fee waivers councils already allocated an additional 100 000 for community grants to eligible applicants to address the operational impact of covet on service provider organization now these grants will open for application to the community next week so keep an eye on that so we've got a hundred thousand out there to help the the community available to help people in the community search so have a look at the website and you'll see it there uh the next question I'd like to direct in new south wales health um I have seen qr codes in outdoor spaces like playgrounds why do I need to check it check in when I am outside yeah thank you um counselor I'm not aware that that is a thing and I don't know if the police uh if inspector holliday's able to comment I don't believe that outdoor places do have check-in requirements um I understand that um through one of our last meetings that bayside will be having qr codes on play equipment in the local area thank you the next question again to new south wales health um what are the main differences between an area of concern and the and greater sydney restrictions yeah I think I did cover that in the presentation so it's only authorized workers can leave bayside to work it's about the outdoor recreation not being permitted and wearing a mask um when you those are the main differences and um otherwise the the restrictions are very similar thank you dr um again another question uh for you dr shepard um I am in the 16 to 39 year old category I go online and the electrical eligibility checker says I am not eligible I can't get a booking how do I book my advisor appointments yes so the um and I probably need some help from my colleague here lisa who's online um the probably the bookings at novotel did fill up very quickly but there will be more bookings available and certainly being a bayside resident in that age group does mean that you are eligible for pfizer so um I would suggest keep on checking that site for the next couple of days and if if we've got your email come back to us and we'll see what what's going on there because it's you certainly are eligible to look at um at the novotel thank you dr shepard um now I have a question again for the new south wales health or the police um I'm a runner do I have to wear a mask when I run well things I understand there is an exemption to mask wearing for us during your strenuous exercise yes where the exercise um affects obviously you do debris through the mask yeah it's preferred that you do wear it but if it interferes with your exercise then you're able to remove it I think that was a question that's been asked many a time thank you for doing that um the next question again for new tough ass health um can you explain compassionate reasons for leaving the lga yeah so I think um perhaps the earlier question that talked about um perhaps an elderly parent that's elsewhere and you need to go to help them around the house um it could be um if um another part of the family there was some essential child care that had to be done um so it's it's about those um important family reasons but if if that happens it can only be one person uh that goes that that goes to or you know if there was um a family member critically ill in hospital then uh that kind of exemption could apply so that's that's what compassionate reasons for leaving the lga would include thank you dr shepherd um another question um I want my children vaccinated when will under 18s be vaccinated yeah so the visa vaccine is already um registered for children from 12 years of age and the moderna vaccine has an application in for that so we expect that will be through later in the year what new south wales health is hoping to be able to offer later in the year is school-based vaccination for children 12 years and older so we don't have any details about that yet but working through those plans at the moment great thank you another question on vaccination why aren't our new vaccination centers appearing when I search online yes so I think you're perhaps looking at um the online searcher is from the commonwealth and again um so this is a these are local initiatives for for local districts and someone from the to find out about these initiatives we'll probably include that on the questions that go out with a number of the other ones that need to be answered as well more clarify that um another question uh to you dr shepard please is um a lot of people I know are getting very anxious and depressed what is their day what is there to help people during this time yeah well I think um rani um covered a lot of the initiatives that councils um implementing and uh so uh I guess we could talk for a long time about how to how to cope with this situation um I think every in a it's a it's a very shared situation it's now right across new south wales um and I think each each person needs to find their own way to be able to to cope it's about finding what um helps you and finding other ways to connect with people online through things like zoom through telephone calls and you know and many people can using those those coping mechanisms the exercise having people but of course some people um can't manage uh and do need additional help so that's in those cases reaching out to gp uh reaching out to the other social services that are available uh because um yeah we everyone uh is if they they uh need help they should be calling out for that and um that it's certainly a lot of programs available to help people during these really tough times thank you again dr shepard another question I think you've got most of the questions um how do we get out of being an area of concern and what is the path for that yeah that's a really interesting question um I i think um as as the mayor pointed out this is very new times and uh the rules are changing very frequently and um so at the moment we this declared areas was something that began just a couple of weeks ago we don't yet have a set criteria for bayside to no longer be a declared area but certainly the kinds of things that I'd be is you know fewer cases each day fewer unlinked cases so that we always know the source of the case and improve vaccination rates so if um and maintaining the testing rates up as high like we saw in the last week so if we can get all those things happening and the case numbers are coming down rather than staying steady then I believe I can recommend to the chief health officer that bayside wouldn't need to be a declared area any further and she could then discuss that with the minister all right thank you dr shepherd uh the next question I I'd like to direct may um it's a question from uh sharon in hillsdale our shares pass a problematic uh with many people sharing our past particular along our foreshore what can we do uh thank you deputy look um as it was mentioned by the doctor and inspector outdoor exercise is permitted with one other person and mass must be worn and I think we've gone through that about running and so forth unless doing a very strenuous exercise like running maintain social distance on our shared paths you've got cycleway you've got you know you've got people with rams uh people running walking so many of our busy outpaths are living in it because we've got it separated to assist in the flow of pedestrian bikes like I mentioned with the brand uh council new south wales health and police have daily briefings where any compliance issue are raised and we discussed strategies on how best to address them we're hoping that the five kilometer restrictions which we didn't have in 2020 will mean that there'll be less people from outside the lga using our porsche it is also advisable to time your exercise in not so busy period I guess that would be a good strategy thank you marijuana um the next question I have uh for inspector holiday um based on lga is large why can't we lock down by suburb there's interesting question I think um orders are a bigger issue um we can't handle locally obviously we've got considerations also we've got to look 19 in neighboring communities and from the south west across the east uh the management of all the government response so at the moment we have a combined eoc running which um so there's no duplication of services and if you look generally I think if we're locked down by suburb we start to see greater restrictions on the residents and also a strong growth in anxiety and stress thank you inspector holiday now I have another question for you as well which is a very popular question uh can I give my um son or daughter who lives with me driving lessons around our lga yeah you know um driving strikers aren't uh authorized workers in the lga as a declared area however residents of the same household and mum and dad are authorised to give their children driving lessons um but it should be within five kilometres of the house all right thank you for that um the next question I have is for new south wales health um what is the difference between exercise and recreation under the public health order thanks yeah and that you would be walking running doing swimming um whereas or you could be supervising children at a playground uh whereas recreation might be yeah sitting on the beach um on a bench etc so you can do the exercise but not the passive being outdoors away from your home unless um you're supervising children at a playground or supervising children exercising thank you dr sheppard and here's another question which is quite interesting um is it true that you can sunbake at the beach if you are not in an lga of concern yeah so that that would be recreation so at the moment a side residents can't_''_1209.84 do that but um in other lgas that are not um declared areas uh I and again I'd refer to the police but I believe that that would be acceptable as long as the social distancing was maintained yeah that's correct and they've got to leave those people in undeclared lgas have to um abide by the five kilometer distance bro thank you uh the next question about construction I have the new south wales orders mean for bayside residents working in construction yeah so yeah this is um an important difference um so if you're working in construction and you're living in a bay side or one the other declared areas um you need to have had two doses of vaccine or had one dose at least 21 days ago um or if you've had one dose and it's within it's less it's like only last week um then you still need to get that uh the the testing every the cover testing every three days so um or and there's also a medical contraindication option there so and then you've got to have the proof of having one of those three criteria and it's also incumbent on your employer to have checked that you've complied with either the vaccination or the testing requirement great thank you dr shepard um so this all almost brings us to the end of the the q a and I'm on my two of the time so the last question I do have is for the mayor days continue this this is question is from maria in botany uh thank you um deputy look I'm quite happy to say the answer is yes they will the only service temporary closed is the community recycling drop-off events um botany and big city depot these are temporary close to encourage people to follow the stay-at-home order in summary all our services that can pick up from your in front of your house or your curb continues as per normally red bin the yellow bin all the services say yes um it will it will continue uh thank you marijuana um I'd also like to thank inspector shane halliday and dr vicky shepherd for their time I'd also like to thank uh meredith and rani for your time as well um uh that's about uh wrapping up with the question and and answers sessions that I hope that has been clarified someone that's clarified some of the confusion about what we can do and what we can't a

so yeah if you'd like to um talk about some books uh we don't we don't have a set book but we're just talking about the books that we personally have read and you can talk about the books that you

access through the basal library website okay so on to the rest of the agenda we're going to talk about some books today as usual yeah um I have got uh science fiction fallon has got a romance romance contemporary romance okay yep would you like to kick us off with your one okay so mine is not any book unfortunately haven't really got any new books for you uh this is actually quite an old book that we have I think this came out in 2016 don't quote me yes so it's called the air and the spare by emily albright this is loosely based on prince william and kate middleton oh okay yeah so I read this about two years ago now I want to say and I actually really liked it actually I think I read this around the time that harry married prince uh megan again don't quote me on that um it's about an american girl called evie and her notes and it's basically ends up being a treasure hunt so the first note is that she wants evie to get into oxford um which is a college if you aren't aware of in england um and she gets in and she goes off to oxford and then she's presented with another note and these notes are basically for her to find out more about her mother's um background and heritage because her mother kept it from her so her mother has a very big secret and she couldn't tell her because she ended up passing I think her mother ends up dying of cancer so she sends her on this treasure hunt like I said to find out the back story and her dad doesn't tell her anything because he was requested not to I think um so she goes to oxford in the process of trying to uncover these letters and filling out tasks um a bit like kind of kind of a bit like dash and lillian the dance thing um she meets a boy but not just any boy he name is edmund and oh my god such a such an english name administers edmund I actually kind of like the name edmund actually yeah it reminds me so much of the chronicles of narnia oh that's so true yeah yeah I can't not think of the question yeah because every time I hear the word edmund he was kind of evil and that always went wasn't evil but he was kind of just like a typical kid yeah um and so yeah she meets edmund and they hit it off and they struck up a friendship and he agrees to help her uncover the letters and he's just generally interested to find out what the secret is and as it goes on she has to basically deal with uh falling in love with the prince and dealing with the paparazzi and all of that comes with hanging around a prince um and it was just a really cute story I really liked it um I do believe one of the friends in this was actually really good and I do believe he ended up getting it unfortunately so there was like a spin-off sequel to this um but I i really enjoyed the characters in this and I did enjoy like the mystery element of her having to find out what was really going on um I can't remember how much I gave it I think I gave it a four um but yeah I really liked it so if you're into royal um contemporaries I highly recommend this one cool yeah what do you have alice uh I have mine I have on the edge of gone which is quite different it's the science fiction I don't talk much about science fiction no we don't um I think I did a science fiction one last week though so uh we can't remember you weren't there I wasn't here that's why I don't remember yes okay um so this one is called on the edge of gone which I just loved like that title really stood out to me I just think it's a great title um how did you find it it was I picked it up uh the cover is quite cool as well it's you know very evocative spaceships what more can you want really in a sci-fi novel true um so this one is about a girl called denise who is autistic and she has a mother who's a drug addict and her sister has gone missing good grief yeah so uh this is all complicated by the fact that the earth is going to be destroyed in a few I think it's a few days so the if the year is uh 2035 and a comet is about to hit us and denise and her sister and mother are supposed to go to like a shelter um or they've been assigned to go to a shelf shelter um but she can't find a sister and they're running out of time um so the novel is kind of about her trying to find her sister but then something else happens she discovers that there's a spaceship that's heading out to colonize new worlds and it's like a generational ship which I there for a really long time and there might be like generations of people on there so you'll be living on the spaceship or something for your whole life I think that's what it means um so the plot is basically basically about her proving that she deserves a space on the ship because it could be on the ship you have to have uh certain skills um or you have to have you have to you have to there has to be a reason why why they want you on there um yeah I actually was expecting more space in this uh because I mean it has spaceships on it um but it's not really a space novel it's more about um it's more like a I guess a family drama so it wasn't really what I wanted in the book but I didn't mind it I thought denise was a good character I thought she was so really it sounds like it's more dystopian than yes sci-fi kind of like apocalyptic not post-apocalyptic because the the apocalypse hasn't happened the in that it's the future so they are like so it's dystopian yeah but it's not a space book um then it's dystopian yeah uh it is very diverse uh her sister is transgender I think their family is mixed race as well so um that's good um yeah I think yeah I like it I didn't mind it too much seems very intense yeah no it was okay you can't even read it what are you talking about didn't you fit you didn't finish it I read half of it so are you sure that this the second half doesn't deal with a lot of space I'm pretty sure it doesn't because I read the reviews anyway we'll cut this bit out anyway that was my book um let's yeah that's it um as we said before uh we will be going back to face to face 9th of february for rockdale 23rd of february for east gardens hope to see you there um this is our last one as well so to miss it you're going to miss it I am I'm going to miss sitting here and just talking about books every week how we've managed to consistently do that for nearly a year I don't know oh my god it's been a serious struggle hence why we've now dipping into things that we've read years ago for you um but yeah yep we've enjoyed it we've had a lot of fun and who knows maybe we'll have a one-off maybe we'll see okay I think that's it from us goodbye I will see you on the night for february here in person or else or else bye see you later

 hi I'm Alexandra Van Dyne and I'm the senior project officer at Bayside Council in this role I help protect some of the beautiful natural areas that we have this includes landing Lakes wetland landing lights wetland is located in Bakke yes in the southern suburbs of Jeannette it's part of the culture of a catchment over the past three years we've taken down quite a few mangroves throughout the water bodies the reason we've done this is because we want to aid in the spread of the salt marsh which was getting over shrouded by mangroves we've also undertaken cutting paint works on kazarina trees and occasional Ignis to aid and promote the spread of salt marsh species some of the challenges we've faced here is the overall size of the site trying to manage everything occurring within the site from time to time has proven to be a bit difficult however managing certain weeds certain times has proven effective to control the site as a whole the junker circuitous plant was growing quite dancing areas of the wetland and a throughout the wetlands to promote the native junkers cross the eye another challenge we face is the the weather extremes so either it be extreme hot or extreme cold we may have plans to spray on a particular day when spraying as needed however we can't manage to always do that impending rain or it's too hot or too cold landing lights wetland is an important area for many Australian coastal wetland Birds it provides a place for them to feed to rest and to raise their young in addition birds from as far away superior fly here during the warmer months to feed to fatten up before they return to the northern hemisphere over time a significant amount of rubbish has being removed from the wetlands to reduce the potentially fatal effect that can have on migratory birds on the whole we've had a great crew that's been coming here they they give it their all edge they're here and with all of the common goal of pushing the site forward and trying to maintain the best outcome for the site as a whole project at this site this was supported by the Kochs River Alliance with funding from the Australian Government
Hi welcome to the online team book squad hi guys um so yeah welcome back for another week we will be talking about some fantasy and science fiction books that we've been reading recently because we do have some exciting news uh which we will tell you at the end of the session catherine what fantasy or science fiction book have you been reading well I picked up um the rise of kyoshi by fce so for those of you who might have heard of it it's based in the universe of avatar there was a tv show in around 2005 called avatar the last airbender that started off this universe and then they had um sequel comics to that and then a sequel tv show based on the next avatar after ang which was cora in legend of korra so this is um kind of different because it's a prequel so it's based on um kyoshi um who was the avatar two avatars before ang so she was the last earth bending avatar and she was also the longest lived so this book's actually a character I'm starting from before she was even discovered as the avatar um until um it's supposed to go up I think until her death but um there's more books in the series so this one goes to a certain point and then it has this massive cliffhanger ending um saying to be continued in the next book I found a little bit annoying because I was invested and then now I gotta wait for another book yeah it's always the way isn't it yeah but um basically um after nine years um after the previous avatar died the world's desperately searching for the next avatar who becomes born as soon as the previous one dies basically um so they they thought they discovered the avatar a young charming earth bender um called avatar and so stability is brought back to the four nations um until um one day um kyoshi who's yon's unassuming friend and servant does this amazing bending and puts into question who is he current avatar so with growing unrest among her allies and with violence companion rangi and also takes um with her some of the mementos left by her parents and disappears and tries to find training while on the run I guess which is kind of hard until they discover um delphi which is on the earth kingdom word for um criminals um so I then follows a bit of morality between kyocera being torn between following the traditional path of an avatar and seeking vengeance for those who she lost um it was a little bit over the place with the writing style for me um I felt like um the time skips were too sudden and a bit confusing um the wall building was really good um I loved learning about um the earth kingdom world and because um in the last airbender um you know about the um air nomads and the air nation and then in koro you discover more about the water tribes so it was really interesting to see the earth kingdom um especially in that time period which is said about two three hundred years before avatar the last airbender and um kirsha herself discovering her her character I felt was a little bit modern for the time period um that could have just been me and the way I was reading it but um I did like her though still and I like the fact it had the romance in a similar style to the two tv shows how it was there but it wasn't this whole thing um so it was just like subtle but it's still focused on the avatar world um as I said I was very disappointed about the cliffhanger so I'm kind of keen to watch this read the sequel um but at the minute I'd probably rate the book about three and a half stars because while I did enjoy it I feel I might be able to give it a better rating once I really see how this author completes the journey um but he has got me invested so props to them um yeah that's my book what about yours uh I've been reading a spark of white fire by sangu mandana um this is based on an indian story called I did practice it a few times so hopefully I got it right um it is set in space and it is described on goodreads I believe as a space opera so a space opera is something like star wars where it's usually uh spans a number of years um can be kind of melodramatic and he's on a pretty large scale so they go from planet to planet and um yeah pretty much that's the space opera I think um I I'm not sure I would describe this as a space opera um I found kind of felt like it was more like a fantasy novel which is a bit weird because again it is set in space but it's kind of interesting because in this world there are these two spaceships called witchstar and kali and they're terraform so if you know what terraforming is is when you take earth and trees and and stuff from from earth and you put it on a spaceship or you put it on a planet to make it more like earth because these people in make it as much like earth as possible so when they are on kali and when they are on which sir you kind of forget that they're in space because there's an atmosphere and there are trees etc etc but it is partially set in space as well so that's kind of the world I did feel like the world building was really good um but I should talk about the plot and the characters uh so the main character is called esme and she is kind of like a banished princess so she came from the planet of the spaceship of kali and she's a member of the royal family but she lives on which star and on kali there is a king called elva who is not the true king so he stole the throne from esme's brother alexi and esme wants to help her brother reclaim the throne and her plan to do that is to go into this competition to win a sentient warship called the titanium and then get alexia on side to to reclaim this throne I will think it's it's got a lot of gods and goddesses in this book and they can help humans so she's got this goddess friend called amber who's kind of her guardian angel I guess and who um who gives her advice about what to do she doesn't necessarily take it though um I think this book would be good for anyone who likes political intrigue so if you like a book where the main character has to uh employ diplomacy to get things to go her way or who has to be very cunning this might be the book for you um yeah I i also liked how it wasn't black and white in a lot of young adult books it's very much good versus evil there's like the the usurper who is on the throne and shouldn't be there and then there's the rightful um heir who uh by the end of the book he's returned to his rightful place this isn't really like that it's definitely a lot more complicated than that and no one is comes to realize um yeah I did enjoy this one I think I would give it as you did about a three and a half out of five um yeah that's my book and we wanted to talk about a couple of things before we say goodbye for this week so tomorrow something quite exciting is happening we are going to be having a science fiction and fantasy writing workshop so if you are someone who are interested who is interested in writing um especially if you're someone who's interested in writing science fiction and fantasy you can tune into this workshop and learn a thing or two about how to write a little bit better so all the details are on at the bayside library eventbrite which you can access through our website which is www.library.bayside.nsw nsw.gov_-RRB-_603.079 dot a u just click on the big e and it should take you to our eventbrite and you can book in um one other thing that I wanted to mention is we are moving back to face space sessions so I believe this is the second last online we're going back to face to face on the ninth of february yep so the ninth of february um you can again book into that online I don't think the bookings are up yet but they should be up about a week before um so that'll be at rockdale and then we'll do one at east gardens later in the month I

 my name is Fausto stuff a manager of governments risk at Bayside Council Bayside Council was actually one of the first councils that went live online with its council meetings and we pulled it off in a very short time so it's a great success the pinnacle of counsel decision-making is the council meetings there are things that the general manager has no authority to make decisions on Oscar's got extensive powers there's certain things under legislation that are only decided by the 15 councilors who I think the thoughts always been there the backs of a possibility we were sort of restricted by legislation for require the 15 counselors to be physically present here around the 25th March things changed and they brought in changes to the Local Government Act which enabled online meetings well I think the most important thing was to make sure that the the 15 counselors could get online and interact and that the public could see and hear the debate decisions been made well ultimately the decisions are the same in terms of that dis's got considered change in terms of he has got to director fourteen people that are on screen and get them to talk at the right time to vote and so on the it was a great team effort and when I say teams of this quite a number of business units there was learning and development there was executive services there is government and really there was AI t that put all the technology together and one of the great things was that we were all learning but we all came together in that short most typed to deliver that council meeting I think in about a week all according to plan a very difficult question politely government itself traditionally the meetings are physical presence of you've got calmly over sighting councillors really difficult to see that changing to online meetings there may be areas where we will coop maybe in terms of the public participation the people can phone in and have their say roughly present but in terms of actually whether counsellors can continue be online or physically present here article you
Hi everybody welcome to the online team book club as you can see I'm flying solo today but um I have a really amazing book to talk about um so my name's catherine and for those of you who don't know we've been reading and discussing book week nominees in the lead up to book week um so this week's nominee is called the boy who steals houses by cg drews and I'll tell you a little bit about it so main character's name is sammy lou he has an older brother and his older brother stuff is from autism so sammy's out breaking into empty houses to try and save enough money for him and his brother to escape their situation and live together um which goes fine until one day he breaks into her house he thought empty but um turns out it wasn't empty um and the story kind of builds up from there um at that house he meets a girl moxie she has a profound impact on them and the book touches upon um their relationship other more um so sammy's 15 and he's dealing with all this pressure so meeting moxie kind of like this person that has no idea what he's been going through is just like a threat a fresh start for him um his brother's name is avery he's about five years older than him um and so avery kind of pops in and out um and it's kind of interesting to see the dynamic entertainment because sammy's really the only one that's able to kind of help him um and when he's um avery's dealing with his autism samI's patient and knows what to do where some people might just get angry um genre I wouldn't really set it as one particular genre but it's got a little bit of mix of romance real world issues contemporary style yeah so it's just basically a mix um so sammy's dealing with this secret that it touches upon throughout the book and you eventually discover it towards the end um and sammy believes if anyone discovers a secret weighs upon him and he's worries that anyone will find out the setting of the book is kind of some set in a coastally town city it's some vacation so it goes to different locations like where kids would hang out the beach and that kind of stuff and sammy gets a chance to just kind of be a kid for once um b15 not deal with all these pressures that he's been dealing with for years um the author she was absolutely amazing um the way she wrote sammy really got into his head and you really feel you are sammy when you're reading it um that you are dealing with these struggles and I just um I love the pace of the book it's not slow it's not fast um it's just a perfect pace I couldn't put it down it took me about two hours to read it and I was really disappointed when it finished um so I'm kind of hoping she might write a sequel with sammy in it one day um it kind of didn could make it work um she we have another um book by her which is called a thousand perfect notes um if it's as good as this book I'm willing to check it out so maybe you guys will too um I recommend it this book for about 15 plus I give it about 5 out of 5 stars and I definitely think it's going to win book week the only other contender that might be a fight against it is when the ground is hard but I mean I love both those books so maybe I'm a little bit biased but anyway um so I highly recommend you guys checking out we got plenty of copies so come to your local library and grab a copy thanks guys bye you

 the basement community trees play an essential role in improving our air quality provide shade create habitat for our native animals and keep our streets and parks looking beautiful to keep our community green we are planting more trees in our streets parks and natural open spaces which will help create an enjoyable place to live in with the planting of more trees we understand that from time to time the roots and trees and plants can cause blockages or damage to sewer pipes in this video I'll talk about some of the causes of pipe and drainage problems and who is responsible for the maintenance and repairs it's important to note that although the trees on council land belong to council property owners are responsible for any services needed that relate to their property as a property owner you are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of drainage pipes that service your property up to the Sydney water main this includes pipes that run under the footpath nature strip and roads the age of the pipes can cause deterioration and subsidence which can cause cracks and joints fail rich nutrient water can leak into the soil and if tree roots come into contact with the moisture they will start to divide and expand rapidly it's often thought that tree roots go in search of water but that is not true tree roots take the opportunity of entering a pipe that has a fault it's rare for tree roots to crack or break a well-maintained drainage pipe to prevent blockages and damages to your pipes it is best to seek advice from a licensed plumber who will give you the correct advice to maintain your drainage line you

What are the main reasons for the support for the Avery introduction of the Bayside ferry service okay from from our point of view it's about his job transport and the tourism part of its that's what prompted Mae and the council to actually respond to what was announced by Marcus Bateman as of the council meeting on the 10th of June to 2020 has there been any further discussion about the development of a wharf embroidery license or the reconstruction of two wharfs in monterey Andals point look after that meeting obviously we flooded the idea about ferry service to Brighton and sand Suzy I've written to the Minister of Transport I've written to the Minister of Tourism as well as the member for Grenada who raised the issue lawsuit over despite wanting to reduce traffic congestion within the local area of what a major concern what major concerns are there with the parking tax with the parking to access the ferry facilities I don't think we would have any parking issues introducing their new service it's actually the opposite I think build service which is ultimately and I think the member for Cronulla even mentioned eventually might be commuter service down the track he'll more than congestion he'll take cars off the road during the meeting there was also discussion of closing off base Street to create a more ambient space like manly how will this impact transportation as base 3 is a main thoroughfare for many people local and wider and will they have to use an alternate route we did have discussion in the past as well about closing Bay Street and there were talks about having a light rail from Rock down through a base Street up to the foreshore I don't think it will have an impact on the traffic because far from it which is the next straight down is president Avenue what are some of the economic benefits that are aspired for Bayside council and local residents if this proposal comes to fruition so I would envisage that having extra like a ferry service closing off based red having the light rail having extra hotels in the area that would definitely attract a the ferries its local businesses especially after covered how has carbon 19 influence the idea of local tourism in the Bayside council area so what's happened while the beaches were closed in other LGAs our beaches were actually open in terms of boardwalks so a lot of people got introduced to Brighton and sand Suzy so that had an influx from other area as well as the locals would you describe this as a sort of reverting to the past with Cove in nineteen getting people more active and more outdoors and less attached to technology sure I'd say more it's said to the new future and the lockdown reminded everyone that there's more to life than being on your iPads and iPhones so there's more people exercising more people to have Gore that's there that's a that's a difference so where some of the key stakeholders that will participate in the reintroduction of the ferry service with the funding it was actually the state whole would be state and federal it's a partnership between the two and they have secured to receive funding from the state government well we're lobbying I think my correspondence to the minister is to lobby get that funding and include the two stops that we're talking about the broad and the Saints and Saint Susie although the project is still in its early stages when do you propose that the ferry service will be fully running perhaps by the end of next year we have that could be complete but it's all in the hands of the state government so we have no control over the timing of it so it's all to do with the with the money that's available to us to include the two stops and and also the state government and they're there sort of timeline
Hello everyone.this we have been helping local schools to deliver a new road safety messages for school zones rules around school zones are in place for a very good reason and that is to protect our children I know we get busy we run late and end up in a rush dropping off or picking up the kids from school but this doesn't give us permission to double Park this survey hey no stopping sign Park in the no parking zone or park too close to a pedestrian crossing disobeying the road rules puts our children in danger and there's never a good excuse for disobeying the road rules our Rangers and parking officers will be patrolling local schools during the morning drop-off and afternoon pickup times it is not about revenue raising it's all about kids safety being our top priority I hope now fans will be issue our target is zero fines for 2020 we could only achieve this with your help and that starts with obeying the road rules child pedestrians are some of our most vulnerable road users they are small and often _''_92.01 or out from behind a parked vehicle school children are easily distracted has responded responsible parents we must do everything we can to protect them I make no apology for I Rangers issuing penalty notices to tests doing the wrong thing in fact I brought them so please before you pull into a nice stop enzyme or double Park because it's convenient think about the child that might be next victim it could be March are who your child let's work together to keep our kids safe thank you you
 hi oh thank when you show here I seem to have misplaced my Pokemon somewhere I came into the library to find out some information because I decided I wanted to be pokemon trainer who doesn't want to be a pokémon trainer got to get those gym bag just somehow and my Pokemon seem to have disappeared I don't know where they are but maybe you can come and help find them so I was looking in this book it's a great book it has all of the information that you need to be a pokemon trainer it has all of the future much Jim masters and what if the pokemons and all about the islands that you can visit isn't that awesome but maybe they should go try and find my Pokemon I really need to find them because I don't want them messing up the library now so come along with me and we'll find them that looks a bit suspicious to me like who are they Team Rocket there's a reward in here a bit terrifying oh what's see let me guess who it is is it a Jigglypuff let me check maybe it's Ivysaur no I've got that right oh I don't know maybe you know the answer guess you'll have to stay tuned to find out but if you know shut it out or write it down follow what what's that look look behind me oh it's good luck we found him what are you doing Piplup oh it seems he's got something should we find out what it is what is it oh you've been reading it it's been reading us oh wow it's a graphic novel these are always good to read if you're just starting out so this is diamond and pearl and surprisingly he's picked this because he's on the front cover I mean but if you want to read more of these I do believe they're down here and I know that there is a Sun and Moon one there's a brand new one that's just coming out too and we have all of these you should begin there's a lot and it deals with ash so you should try it they're always a fun adventure and there's plenty of them and you'll never run out Thank You Piplup well at least I found him what oh he wants to go back to reading it so I just let's go for the rest of the journey shall we and see who else we can find Oh what is this I look like a quiz let's do it shall we what is the name of the evolved Charmander hmm what is its evolution I could look it up but I feel like that might be cheating so why don't you tell me the ants eyes write it down below and we'll see what happens now where are they I can't equip us there is what are you doing down here Oh near a quiz and a book you're on fire today so what book do you have of course catching the jigglypuff thief are you a thief is it good it's excellent what did you bed you telling me that there's more so do you want to come in and read some more then you're welcome to do that so is there just over there is a little nervious well I'll let him get back to his reading but it looks like you've got a question for us so shall we do it Jigglypuff likes to do but when it's around people we should probably exit before he starts to do it because no one wants to see the end of that really sly duck why you're confused that doesn't surprise me in the slightest why are you confused oh that's a good way of being confused he doesn't know where to start I should probably show you he's right here right do you want to know where to start well there's many ways of where to start to watch your DVD so if you want to watch the on originals we don't have they're not don't seem to be here but we have these which are based on all Pikachu DVDs about Bulbasaur squirtle and Charmander now if you just want to watch the anime my advice would be to start with x and y we have those but my favorite I think I'm a little bit biased and you'll find out why later but my favorite is Sun and Moon which is the recent one so we have these ones here now if you just want to watch the movies which you can we have the power of us we also have which one I choose you which is the one he wants but it doesn't seem to be here so someone else might have it but we could always put it on reserve so these are the ones that you can get but my advice would be to start up with Sun and Moon or X&Y there are some other DVDs which are other movies X&Y again these are just movies it's up to you whether you want to read the watch them or not but that's my advice the other 2x and white and Sun and Moon is that what you probably clean this up before the librarian comes over yells with me gonna help no okay just watch me you're having fun with this night yeah all right I'll let you go back there and choose which one you want okay good you have fun with that and when you've decided your choice you come and get me all right now we'll have to find the room that what you're trying to tell me guys all right who have we got here these three starter Pokemon are from what region can you tell me what region they're from bonus points if you can also give me the names of each three all right let's go and see if we can find the last of my Pokemon what are you doing you found some books but not the one you're looking for is that right apparently he looked up on the catalogue a book for himself it was written one but it's out we can put on reserve signup a good idea do that but what else have you found go poplar given that that's where he's from so these are readers they're usually for people that are going into it before the middle grade so they're easy to read and they have pictures these are the golden ones if anyone wants to get these now you got this because you're in here yep okay he wants them because he wants to read about his friends sounds perfect to me all right we'll get those right you want to go back to reading them and searching for more okay you can come and find me after well it seems I found all my Pokemon but there's one other thing that I really want to fly it and that's the handbook it has all 800 Pokemon so along with my encyclopedia I'd like to get that so that I can use it because my pokedex decided to die so let's go and see if we can find the handbook and then we'll head off what turn behind me oh we have the number quiz sylveon is what type of Pokemon now I don't you write in the comments and let me know tell you right now one of my favorite evolutions oh another quiz shall we see what it is Snorlax is known for doing what hmm I'm gonna let you guess that long Clara do you know the answer and I don't want to tell you just yet or hold on to that hey you all are that's a really good social distance in guys it's very important that when you come into the library that you must social distance what have you got oh they've found the handbook perfect so this is the handbook that has over 800 Pokemon that's all of them up to the gala region so sword and shield will not be in here but everything up to Sun and Moon is there trying to find where they are

and beautification many other parks have been developed to similar standards of locality careful planning has placed our municipality in the forefront of development of this nature 20,000 pounds per year is a sum well spent in developing these lungs for the community green carpets of open space that have the magic quality of transporting us to a fairyland of healthy interest recreation and happiness places to which our people may venture in search of contact with the good earth the green sward and the beauty and restfulness of nature 4,000 pounds of modern playground equipment dispersed

these are the cradles of good citizenship tolerance and sportsmanship from which these children will graduate to the playing fields where for adolescents and adults the council has established 44 cricket wickets and 22 other playing fields for football hockey baseball Figaro and all types of healthy sport our British heritage has bequeathed us a love of cricket and all ball games our climate affords us an all around the gear character and it is a function of local government cheerfully embraced by Rockdale to provide the means for such development the municipal 18-hole golf course at Bexley is an asset of great importance in the life of the community the beautiful clubhouse is the home of the Bix li golf club which shares the course with casual public players of the Royal and ancient game the club acting as host of the council's course provides meals and facilities for the public in addition to the excellent club service available to its members this opportunity for healthy Sport and Recreation is embraced by 50,000 people each year club members and the public alike enjoy a popular sport on a course designed and constructed by the council as a major step in its programme of recreational service to the public this standard course extending over undulating and attractive countryside enjoys wide popularity and is entirely self-supporting a vast green space of inestimable value to the community devoted to the extensive use of people playing the most popular and perhaps the most skillful of ball games the Bexley north municipal bowling government can play in providing suitable amenities for the people this venture too is entirely self-supporting the club repaying the capital cost by way of rent but there is no room for such mundane thoughts as rent when Kitty beckons and finally modern public tennis courts highlight the range and variety of effort devoted to the physical well-being and recreation of the citizens for schools of art subsidized and encouraged by the council remain the foundation upon which council has progressively built its program of activity in the fields of culture music and the arts and it is in this and the charitable and social field that the mayor is and ladies of the council play their partner music in our community begins with three musical societies operating at our beautiful town hall and four brass bands promoted by the council stages in the plan which lead to even greater cultural achievements the famed Rockdale municipal orchestra 50 players under the battle of Cedric Ashton and the rough Dale Municipal Opera Company represent the most forward movement in local government cultural efforts by means of these ventures the council and wide in interpretation and appreciation of orchestral music ballet in the Opera thus bringing to the people a wealth of the pleasure and education not otherwise available to them in our ventures these outstanding artists found encouragement and opportunities that have since served them well in their careers service to the citizens of tomorrow begins at the baby health centers Council is operating two of these centers is erecting a third and a fourth is being planned the service and influence of local government recognizes no age barrier we truly appreciate our obligation to every phase of community life we continue our interest in the young citizen in the preschool kindergarten established by council in a Municipal Building furnished and equipped for the purpose and controlled by a Citizens Committee at least two more such ventures are being planned by the council as they leave the kindergarten these kiddies will join the 1,200 older children who each year attend the numerous summer holiday play centers conducted by the council the next step in service is to the school-aged child the outstanding example of this is the continuously in 12 local schools for the adolescent groups of Scouts and Girl Guides we provide clubhouse sites and recreational facilities the council is very conscious of its obligation to the growing citizen of tomorrow it can and does extend its benevolent interest to the needs and welfare of the growing child and the adolescent who will soon be expected to make a real contribution to the life and government of the community activities in this field in close cooperation with schools and parents bring their own reward in happy and healthy children and pay dividends in citizenship that enrich not local government alone but our nation and way of life children growing in the tradition of fathers whose memory is perpetuated by the council in many ways the garden of memory lest we forget lest we forget our obligations to those of our community who made it possible for us to build with confidence in the future in the forefront of councils obligations to the community has been placed the Civic rehabilitation of ex-servicemen Memorial Hall sites have been provided for no less than seven sub branches of the their services and sacrifices to the country have been encouraged to look to the council for sympathetic understanding their problems more concrete expression of the thanks of the community is found in the numerous home sites subdivided and made available to ex-servicemen and their families on council land so the council provides for a grateful community those lasting symbols and expressions of memory and tribute to the sacrifices of our citizens and it is in this spirit and tradition of service that the council functions under the leadership of the mayor in entirely Andhra management of this vast organization aldermen JH Jones RJ Scott eg button a Maynard and Edo caste prepare for the arduous demands of a long and frequent session of the council under the chairmanship of the first citizen is worship the mayor aldermen a Jones aldermen NC guests CCW 9jg McCormick and Seabrooks follow the debate opened by alderman Artie Gosling chief engineer Carson assistant engineer Gilchrist and bards manager Sandin advice Council on technical and engineering matters and supervise outdoor activities alderman EA Tyndall FP Baron e McGinnis and HG Carruthers refer to the mayor Rob chief health inspector Mitchell chief building inspector orchard and accountant Todd the basic concern of the council is of course the annual Public Works program with modern plant worth more than 80,000 pounds the council spends three hundred and fifty thousand pounds annually in essential service to the community streets must be designed drained and constructed footpath provided curbing and guttering installed the thoroughfares illuminated and maintained frequently top pressed and generally cleansed and kept free of weeds an almost endless but basically important task demanding time thought and planning on the part of unpaid representatives of the people skilled engineering costly plants supervision and workmen trained in a variety of ways and great quantities of material this will constitute a major activity of the council for many years a program depending from time to time upon prevailing costs and the limits imposed by common-sense application of the outmoded system of financing local government solely by direct property taxation the needs of the municipality are carefully sifted the relative urgency of each work is gauged and so is accomplished in each year the best possible program of maintenance and loading of the municipality and a typical year's work program ranges from the mowing of parks and streets to the construction of 150 chains of concrete pathways 140 chains of ballasted and blacktop roadways and the Rishi ting of great lengths of footpaths an average of almost two miles of concrete curbing and guttering is the target each year in this way the footways and carriage ways are defined the thoroughfares drained and nuisance and inconvenience completely eliminated the major works operation is the construction of the completely ballasted blacktop roadway this is the ultimate aim and the end towards which council progresses after construction these thoroughfares demand repeated resealing and at least nine miles of this process must be programmed each year the constructed roads must be preserved and so the council must pause to allocate men plant and material to this speedy and costly work the Works Department of our activities alone set us apart as the largest single industry in the district other basic needs of the years activity are public health services annually diphtheria immunization clinics mass TB x-ray surveys rat control measures health week residents who enthusiastically comb their premises and place all non combustible rubbish in the street for quick collection and removal by the council the qualities of rubbish removed indicate wholehearted cooperation in keeping the municipality clean and tidy and discouraging rats and vermin the rubbish product of this public health campaign is rolled and covered and put to good use in reclaiming low-lying areas in modern local government great attention is paid to communal cleanliness an important aspect of which is the frequent collection and disposal of household garbage here the service is rendered twice each week to over 20,000 homes the council employing the most modern convenient and hygienic garbage vehicles which entirely enclosed the garbage and reduce the work and strain upon the wetland new methods can and do eliminate the objectionable features of distasteful but essential service and even the disposal of household refuse can be dignified by thought and enterprise ours was one of the first councils to appreciate the disadvantages of the old methods of sanitation and to replace them with a complete fleet of these modern vehicles the council has pioneered and broken fresh on the subject of food handling have been compiled by the council and trained health inspectors conduct frequent classes to educate the food shop proprietor employee and the paying public in hygienic and modern methods of food preparation storage handling and distribution progress demands that the old methods give way to news time and energy must be found for still greater amenities such as this rest center for women about to be built in Bexley others are being considered elsewhere amidst all these services we press on with the

 eleven miles south of Sydney is botany bay scene of Captain James Cook's first Anchorage on that historic day in the year 1770 today nearly 200 years later and close to the landing place of its famous namesake the handsome Captain Cook bridge proudly spans the George's River at its entrance to the bay with the rapid expansion of population south of the Georges River in botany bay the new bridge was necessary to relieve traffic congestion for the nearby Tom uglies bridge could not cope with the growing traffic loads the site selected for the new bridge was almost a mile downstream where a beer killer ferry running between San Souci and Teheran point was operating to the limit of its capacity the bridge is a link in the future expressway which will connect the City of Sydney with the expanding industrial areas to the south at Wollongong and Port Kembla the Captain Cook bridge has an overall length of sixteen hundred and sixty-two feet and is made up of seven spans ranging in length from 185 feet to 250 feet driven through the riverbed and the underlying sand and mud down to the solid sandstone at depths from 60 feet to 220 feet below water level the driven piles used are unique in Australian bridge construction consisting of a pre-stressed concrete upper section and an h-shaped rolled steel lower section to avoid corrosion of the steel a concrete section extends in each case to a minimum of 25 feet below the riverbed work began in 1962 with the driving of the piles the steel lower portion has first lifted into the driving rig and driven dock each pre-stressed concrete pile contains an embedded steel section so enabling the two portions to be welded before driving is continuing for driving the piles down through the riverbed a large steam hammer was installed delivering thirty seven thousand foot-pounds of energy at each blow at the rate of sixty blows to the minute as many as eighty thousand blows were needed to drive the longest piles to the required depth to test its capacity a load of two hundred and eighty tons twice the designed load was placed on the head of cylindrical piles three feet in diameter excavation 10 feet into rock was carried out inside steel cylinders driven to the rock the cylinders are then cleaned out and filled with crushed basalt cement grout is mixed onshore and pumped by a line to the piles where it's forced under pressure through the basalt to form concrete the tops of the piles are encased in large caps of reinforced concrete Anchorage's are provided for securing the pier columns to the pile caps for the concrete pouring of the pile caps the concrete is delivered by floating crane the concrete is then compacted by pneumatic vibrators the strong tidal characteristics of the Georgia's River made completion of the pouring of concrete in the pile caps a matter of considerable urgency work continues on into the night under flood light until the pile caps are ready to receive the pier columns it should be particularly noted that in line with modern trends and construction the concrete used in the Captain Cook bridge was predominantly in the form of precast units manufactured away from the bridge at Penrith a typical peer column block measures 11 feet in length with a height of 4 feet 5 inches width vary from 7 feet one inch to 4 feet 6 inches all blocks have a wall thickness of 9 inches the average weight of each block being 7 and a half tons as each peer column block is delivered to the bridge site its transferred to a barge and towed out to the scene of operations the attachment of a steel frame enables the floating crane to lift each block securely and accurately for final positioning in the pier column as the bridge construction develops the car ferry between San Souci and Teheran point continues to fly back and forth past the bridge site as each column of blocks is completed the blocks are anchored to one another by the insertion of eight high tensile steel bars to positioned vertically inside each corner to secure the bars jacking equipment is employed a force of 42 tons being applied to each bar and the holding down nut screwed home the force being indicated on a pressure gauge as a check on the lid for the construction of the beams that will span between the piers steel falsework is assembled on barges and towed out into the street where it's maneuvered by winches and jacks and by the aid of tidal action into position ready to receive the beam blocks each beam consists of hollow reinforced concrete blocks at the end of each span special end blocks are provided the first block in the beam mates over the last block of the previous beam the steel roller bearing is later inserted in the horizontal gap by January 1964 almost a third of the beams are in position as already mentioned the predominance of precast concrete is a feature of the Captain Cook bridge and all the beam blocks were precast at regents park outside Sydney in the case of the end blocks Anchorage's are provided for the high tensile steel tables which will bind the blocks together and start a reinforced to resist the large forces to be encountered in the preparation of the mold ducts are provided to receive the cables intervals along the beams thus connecting the four beams transversely continuous supervision was maintained by the Department of Maine roads at all yards engaged on the pre casting of concrete units for the bridge the dimensions of the beam blocks range in length from seven feet six inches to 12 feet in height from eight feet to twelve feet while their width is uniform at eleven feet by July 1964 the construction workers well-advanced and the graceful lines of the bridge have become evident as the precast beam blocks arrive at the riverbank they are placed onto a special tipping device which rotates them into the correct position for placing on the falsework with an average weight of 17 tonnes this intermediate operation is essential for smooth handling delivery into position from the riverbank is affected in the same manner as used for the peer column blocks by barge across to the floating crane to be placed on the falsework with a three inch gap between each block at last the final beam block is lifted from the barge and lowered towards the falsework with careful of the last be a final signal and the block is brought gently to rest and so all 736 blocks are in position if the blocks are assembled on the falsework the three inch gaps between each are filled with high-strength concrete making the beams continuous from end to end the filling of the gaps takes place concurrently outside and inside the beams the beams are then stressed by the introduction of one on 8 inch diameter high tensile steel cables fed through ducts in the in blocks and secured with steel wedges before any high tensile steel cables were used samples were tested at the Department of Main Roads central testing laboratory in a machine capable of exerting a pull of 200 tons the elastic properties of the one and one eighth inch table were measured first after which the delicate measuring device was removed and the cable loaded right up to breaking for results of testing were carefully plotted and the tensile properties of the sample evaluated on the bridge site jacking equipment applies the force to lock the beam applied to each cable in turn all readings are carefully recorded and checked to ensure that the correct force is applied to allow for expansion and contraction with changes of temperature roller bearings of special armored plate steel are placed between mating surfaces of the special end beam blocks one of the completed beams was test loaded in order to check its carrying capacity the performance of the loaded beam was carefully recorded and studied with the bridge nearing completion embankments are brought up at each end to form the approach roads and heavy equipment is used to move the earth and compact it thoroughly the abutments at each end of the bridge are formed from reinforced concrete frames covered with concrete facing slabs the deck of the abutment is supported on pre-stressed concrete girders fifty feet in length which were manufactured at black top for the girders steel reinforcement and high tensile steel strands are assembled each of the strands is loaded to 11 tonnes with a hydraulic jack the girders are then subjected to testing as a check on their capacity span between the beams of the bridge to carry the roadway prior to the pouring of deck concrete steel reinforcement is placed between the free cast deck slabs as the work progresses Footwear's are formed on either side of the bridge by the attachment of precast concrete slabs to the outer girders the method employed in installing the footway slabs is of particular interest the slabs are first brought into position brackets are then fitted over bolts fixed in the main beams to brackets being welded to each slab tightening of the nuts on the bolts then allows for fine adjustment of the level of the slabs thereby eliminating all need of force work with the deck ready to receive the concrete surface mechanized bearers are brought into play to convey the concrete from the delivery trucks while a bonding solution is sprayed on the concrete is thoroughly compacted with pneumatic vibrators and finally leveled off with a vibrating screed as with all concrete in the bridge the deck concrete was sampled for examination of consistency and strength the measure of consistency is provided for strength testing the concrete is molded into cylinders six inches in diameter and 12 inches in length after curing for 28 days in a fog room each cylinder is capped with molten sulfur giving it a precisely through surface it is then placed in a testing machine capable of exerting a force of 200 tonnes and tested to destruction the force required to crush the concrete cylinder is then recorded following completion of the deck the carriageway curbs are formed up the pouring of concrete into the curb forms provides the final encasement of the bolts holding the foot way slabs in position there by permanently securing the footwear meanwhile concrete is brought to various points along the deck for delivery to the inside of the beams where the high tensile steel cables are being encased the concrete is thoroughly compacted to seal the cables against salt air and dampness steel safety railings are erected along the outer edges of the foot ways and secured by bolts cast into the concrete for added protection the handrails are coated with zinc followed by two coats alo concrete wall is erected and surmounted by a heavy tube railing forming a crash barrier overhead lighting is incorporated into the bridge structure by the provision of ducts in the concrete for the distribution of electric wiring steel plates with interlocking fingers are installed to cover the gaps between the ends of adjacent beams to permit expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes next our median strip of concrete is placed on the deck to separate opposing streams of traffic before placing the roadways asphalt surface layer a tech coat of bitumen is sprayed onto the concrete deck as felt delivered to the site at a minimum temperature of 275 degrees Fahrenheit is discharged onto the deck and applied evenly by means of a mechanical spreader a smooth impervious surface being obtained by thorough rolling finally the Captain Cook bridge is complete in its construction 18,000 cubic yards of concrete have been used together with 2,000 tons of steel reinforcement on May the 29 1965 a large and enthusiastic crowd gathers to watch the opening ceremony this is performed by the governor of New South Wales the bridge is a real credit to everyone who had any hand in its building do you wonder then ladies and gentlemen that it will give me the very greatest pleasure to declare this Captain Cook bridge open a commemorative plaque is unveiled by the governor who then formally opens the bridge the official party leads the way over the newly-opened bridge and the people eagerly throng the roadway to inspect their new position while the Tarin point car ferry passes alongside the structure that now replaces it after 49 years of faithful service and so the Captain Cook bridge named after the intrepid Englishman who sailed into Australian waters nearly 200 years earlier now stands as a bold symbol of the nation's progressed it's smooth classical lines stem from a design advanced by world standards and it is aesthetically satisfying as well as being entirely functional built for the Department of Main Roads New South Wales by John Holland constructions proprietary limited at an overall cost of three and a quarter million dollars the fulfillment of its role as part of the Southern Expressway has the relief of traffic congestion and to the improvement of safe driving conditions
 within the allah homes shops factories schools hospitals all serving the 76,000 people who have chosen to live in this driving community throughout the years living standards have been raised and each step along the way has been beset with complex problems to be solved by a central body for the good of the whole community here's the case in point until nineteen to knock downs library service was conducted from a central Depot by way of bookmobile the demand for good books made necessary the establishment of a central library and Saturday the 8th of February 1958 saw the official opening of a new building the Rockdale Branch Library this gala occasion was attended by a great number of people many of whom had materially assisted in the new project mr. Metcalfe chairman of the Library Association of New South Wales paid tribute to the cultural aspirations of the people of Rockdale and promised the continuing support of his association his good wishes were acknowledged by the mayor alderman JH Jones who unveiling a commemorative plaque officially declared the new library open official make use of this innovation the library was completed at a cost of 8090 pounds and the purchase of book stock for the branch cost a further three thousand nine hundred and eighty pounds it is equipped with complete catalog facilities in addition to books of fiction and nonfiction there is an excellent reference library the younger citizens of Rockdale have also been cared for the children's section as well patronized and storytime a special treat is relished by the very young most people agree that amenities such as these are worth their cost but where does the money come from to carry them out the main source of income is from municipal rates every pound of rate monies is directed according to an annual financial budget under seven different headings maintaining the library services in Rockdale cost only eight than squatting in the pound money spent on public works in the area amounts to eight shillings and three farthings of every ratepayers power the engineer and his staff now housed on the first floor of the new municipal offices is responsible for the construction of major projects complete design are ironed out specifications and costs are prepared as part of the supervision of every job undertaken plans of all projects are carefully filed away for future reference a new development plan some years ago is now taking shape at Bexley north on the site the engineer mr. litter coats his assistant mr. brand and surveyor mr. Cheuk confer as plan is converted into fact this project involves the leveling of three acres of wasteland the moving of over 8,000 tons of earth and rock on this area will be erected a row of shops a modern hotel and a service station there will be parking for 150 cars and all the amenities to be found in an up-to-date shopping center drainage of such a large area of land must be done scientifically for dispersal of hundreds of tons of stormwater which may collect in a matter of minutes makes it necessary to lay down concrete pipes of large diameter meanwhile the foundations for the hotel are being constructed by the Francophile method steel cylinders are driven into the earth and filled with concrete a heavy weight released piledriver to form a solid formation the site now begins to take shape as more sections of the project get underway first of the steel work goes into position the council is constructing 12 chains of roadway around the sacs with excess ways for a large volume of vehicle er traffic there will be more than 2 acres of bitumen surface laid down when the work is finished under the supervision that the council's engineers the work on the north Bexley project is moving ahead towards completion before the end of the year the concentration of traffic on the prince's highway has for a long time being a growing problem after careful consideration it was agreed that if James Street a narrow road was widened and extended to join more Street a secondary road would be available to carry a proportion of the southbound traffic this was what the engineering Brants were faced with when the job was begun in James Street a wandering dirt track through the sand hills earthmoving today is a matter of mechanical horsepower the pick-and-shovel road gang has gone and modern equipment the time-saving factor is most important over 5,000 tons of earth and sand moved and leveled in less than 8 weeks in horse and carriage days James Street was a narrow roadway ending in a swamp now to play the part of a highway a full-width roadway must be constructed properties on the old alignment have to be resumed the old-time steamroller is superseded by a small vibrator roller which while being only a fraction of the weight of the steam roller achieves a considerably greater consolidation of the road pavement by literally shaking the material into position the road foundation being completed the next step is the setting out of the kerbin guttering and the problems of adjusting the levels of properties aligning the roadway long sections of formwork are set up and the concrete is delivered ready mix directly into the forms a tech coat of liquid bitumen is poured onto the pavement to ensure that the aesthetic concrete will adhere to it this is a durable surfacing material which is spread mechanically to provide a smooth riding surface the aesthetic concrete surface course is being a multi wheeled pneumatic tired roller which has the same rolling effect as cars and trucks August saw the new James Street finished and traffic was quick to discover this new route with the completion of the James Street project an alternative route has been provided avoiding the congested areas of an Cliff Banksia and Rockdale and rejoining the princes highway at present Avenue the council's new Worx tipper is at Bexley and it was built without cost to the ratepayers the lease of the site of the old Depot in Princes Highway supplied the finance from the initial rental of twenty three thousand six hundred pounds council was able to complete the new Depot at a cost of twenty two thousand seven hundred and seventy pounds proper care and maintenance is vital to the economic operation of municipal plants a completely up-to-date motor vehicle repair shop is properly equipped to care for the maintenance of the vehicles at present in use five new trucks were purchased this year and old trucks disposed of in accordance with council policy steam-cleaning helps to keep the heavy red vehicle and span of valuable man-hours in the plant service section the careful check is kept on every piece of equipment here a tractor operated rotary mower is undergoing service here to the smaller types of rotary mower are kept in order from the stork and the road signs barriers safety lamps in fact all the small items needed for the public works of rough day recreation facilities and other public amenities and services are no less important than road footpaths and similar works these custard ratepayer and a penny Haney in the pound the total expended on tax alone being about fifty-two thousand pounds annually recreation facilities are an important function of local government and these scenes of the first regatta of the San Jorge rowing club are an example Rockdale is fortunate in having on the reaches of cooks river a rowing course of Olympic standard one of the few in the state this race marks the official opening of the temporary Club room and sculling course the competing crews being from outer Sydney clubs Alderman Lawler and others prominent in administration of this fine aquatic sport outline the by no means overlooked so far as recreation is concerned at Scarborough Park an area on the eastern side of the lake has been allocated to this and George Amedore women's sport Association and a completely new amenities block constructed the ground is used on weekdays by school girls who train under the guidance of their sports mistresses well who knows from Scarborough Park may come a future Betty Catherine Marlene Matthews or Shirley Strickland grace precision and physical development are the key note of the matching girls movement the matching girls have rough there are no exception they're on parade the dame as is the rough their district band to add color and interest to an important civic occasion here the then Governor of New South Wales said John Northcote inspects the guard of honour on his visit to open a new and most necessary community project the school for subnormal children that Beach Street the Honorable mr. J McGraw in LA tells a large audience of the Sterling efforts put forth by many citizens to prepare for this great day Haldeman Gosling mayor of Rock the citizens the honour of which the governor has paid the municipality by his presence his Excellency informally declaring open the school commends the committee and citizens and the efforts which have created wonderful opportunities for the less fortunate children of the community ministering to the health of the municipality involves foreign tuppence ha'penny of the ratepayers pound the council's Health Department has been redesigned to cope with the vigorous health policy laid down by Council all citizens are doing the community a service if they report the purchase of unwholesome foodstuffs protection from food poisoning has come to be taken for granted nowadays but it's as important as the campaign against polio myelitis commenced in Rockdale in 1956 more than 63,000 injections have been given and not one case of polio has occurred since the draining of swamp areas is a constant but expensive work it is important that drainage water finds its way to the sea with the rising tide seawater backs up into the swamp areas killing the her birds and creating nuisance and flooding the Scarborough drainage scheme was designed to has been constructed on the freshwater side of the discharge tunnel to prevent the saltwater making its way inland on the seawall side of the tunnel gates also prevent the surge of soft water from holding up the flow of fresh water into the sea sand erosion on the foreshore of botany bay and the drifting of it across the grand parade to frontages of high-class residential property is being solved in an awful way and at no cost to the community at kima we see this project in operation contracts for the sale of sand have been let and here machinery is excavating to a depth of 20 feet below the level of the roadway in 1958 several contracts were let resulting in forty six thousand two hundred and fifty cubic yards of sand being removed and the sum of ten thousand and forty one pounds being received by council into these sand pits household garbage collected in councils twice weekly services tipped the garbage is covered with ash and then with soil at the conclusion of each day's tipping and pest control is exercised with the use the Council at Cana will then have its own parkland area adding a further Green acre along the seven mile beach front the council proposes to continue this major project for many years until the whole area is developed all building undertaken in Rockdale municipality is carried out under the council's supervision the building inspectors office therefore is a busy place in highly industrial areas factory acreage is increasing steadily methods of construction must be carefully analyzed and the approval of plans requires a keen knowledge of building design and construction new areas have been made available as home building sites and the plans were not less than 350 dwellings were inspected and passed in 1958 here's an example Kellerman's estate once a market garden now has 29 modern colorful houses fronting 3 bitumen surfaced streets 94% of all new homes in Rockdale are a brick construction and these reflect the improving standard of design demanded by the householder of today to own ones home is the goal of most Australians similar thinking has stimulated the building of home units waterfront views and modern decor of these of Community Development the allocation of one and three in the pound from municipal rates has done much to solve a problem in council administration on the ground floor of the new annex to the town hall an additional nine hundred square feet of office space has been made available to house the new mechanical aids to assist the accounting and record staff which among other things produces thousands of notices every year a self-contained printing plant which cost sixteen hundred and fifty pounds will save the council about twelve hundred pounds in the first year of its operation latest addition to the accounting branch is this sense emetic accounting machine it is an excellent example of automation keeping up-to-date electoral rolls for a population of 76,000 people is done with the aid of this address a graph machine information transferred to metal plates is collated and fed into the machine any alteration to the electoral rolls is confined to altering one plate and reprinting at that page only big savings in labor and other costs have been obtained by its purchase the head of the administrative machinery operations of a large staff and advising Council where necessary he is the legal officer interpreting local government law the town clerk must keep in constant touch with the mayor through his rough tears leading citizen and the representative of each and every rate payer and residents the mayor controls the activities of council and represents the community at all important functions here we see him with the town park arranging the detailed program of a vice-regal visit to the district this was the presentation by the Rockdale opera company over SinI's The Barber of Seville before his Excellency the governor of New South Wales Lieutenant General Sir Eric Woodward and lady wood would the mayor representing the citizens of Rockdale acknowledges the honor paid to the municipality by this visit of the Queen's personal representative and the vice-regal party is escorted to the Town Hall on stage the players received last-minute instructions from conductor Cedric Ashton prior to the performance of Racine ezel arias work presented in a manner worthy of a great occasion at a reception held in the castle chamber at the conclusion cast were presented to their excellencies Rockdale was one of the first municipalities to recognize the need of facilities for its senior citizens in 1958 with the assistance of the Raphael Rotary Club the first Center at La fiere was I found Ramsgate Santa was next designed by the Rotary clubs honorary architect council contributed 2000 times towards its construction a local committee financing the remainder of the construction and equipment at a meeting of the Rockdale centrum senior citizens share an active appreciation of council's efforts on behalf of the older people of the municipality the Dixon the chairman has this to say fellow members reaction of the Rockpile Council in providing halls and amenities for the senior citizens of Rockville the happiness provided in those halls is truly amazing he justifies the action of the council the end of the industrial life is such an important one it should not be allowed to just white the white people as they go about their daily tasks are apt to forget the importance of local government administration the Rockville council works and plans unceasingly for every section of interest of its citizens for in their hands lies the future of the municipality you
Jet-propelled Giants of the air coming to roost they come from over the oceans across the continents from round the world bearing the proud insignia of a dozen airlines they'd lumber along the taxiways putting thousands of people every day of the year to and from the International Terminal at Kingsford Smith Airport Australia's gateway to the world some travelers step straight over the threshold into the municipality of Rockdale a beach fringed sun-filled front garden to the southern continent many stay bringing with them new cultures new outlooks to our changing community exposed to the influences of a shrinking world one of these visitors to Rockdale was the distinguished leader of the British Conservative Party mr. Edward Heath who landed here during 1968 with a message from the people of Bexley in England at a civic reception the mayor aldermen Gosling warmly welcomed mr. Heath and said that in visiting Bexley he was preserving an historical link that goes back many years to the very beginnings of the municipality he then presented mr. Heath with a history of the district handing over a painting of whole place said that this linked with the history of the Tube Exley's proves that the world is shrinking he came from one Bexley to the other in a matter of hours he met some older residents who remember when the voyage took months the Nappers were among the first to settle the swamps and forests that stretched back from botany bay bill napa remembers those early days Rockdale in the early days who is known as the vegetable bowl of Sydney this was brought about because the land between Cooks River and George's River was particularly suitable for vegetable growing but not much progress was made by the early pioneers until a road was built across cooks River once this was built the area began to develop fairly rapidly but the roads were in such a deplorable state that it was almost impossible for the pioneers to get their vegetables to the Sydney market without a lot of trouble this led to mr. Charles Anton happen petitioning the government of the day for local government for this area that petition was signed by all the early pioneers in this the first job of the new council was to try and improve the roads the main road then was known as Rocky Point Road leading from sanssouci leading from crooks River to San Souci now known as Princess Highway this road was in such a deplorable state that the early settlers had to break down branches of trees and lay across the road in front of the Rockville Town Hall to stop their vehicles from being bogged the change from bridle track to traffic artery has been repeated throughout the district this road which began as a Bullock track leading to the great forests of Hurstville became forest road at the beginning of the century off this now busy thoroughfare just around the corner and Halle Avenue is a pretty home they too were pioneers of the district we spoke to mrs. pretty of her childhood in Rockdale I first came to big slate 38 years ago as a bride my very first memories have basically where does a young child of the rabbi female my father had a buggy and we used to draw Christ here on the Saturday point out by chemstro home of the credit home and the kinkiest home it was from King saw Grove down to the hotel and British Raiders from here John has been a pretty shrewd King for growth and biz brass which were the names of the old homes were really beautiful they were magnificent they were set back in beautiful grounds well the King solid came originally from the north of Ireland and grandfather counselor had his own family crest and he bred racehorses and the pretties came from England and they brought up much land in victory but eventually failed the council at a small cost and as the subdivided into different properties and they gave the big of the Victory Park to their councils the pretties have been in victory for many generations and my grandchildren are John Mark and Katrina are the fifth generation born in victory the first settlers were British now more and more people from many different patients from all walks of life are making their homes in Rockdale with every naturalization ceremony these changes in the community become more noticeable from greece and the children are being accepted into the community they're learning to adapt to a new way of life a life often vastly different to the one they left behind the transfer of allegiance from one country to another means the acceptance of a new set of laws a new set of values a new set of neighbors for adults this can be a difficult task those that reap the full benefit other children already up to sixty five percent of the children attending some schools in the municipality our new Australians they face the task of learning to speak and think in English the written word must be understood and therefore libraries have a vital part to play in the service of our changing community at the official opening of the Bexley North Branch Library it was pointed out that libraries are storehouses of the whole world's knowledge and in this country all that knowledge is free for the asking in these surroundings the peoples of different countries and cultures are being brought closer together towards a better understanding of each other's needs now three branch libraries and a mobile library operating within the municipality literature serves the peoples of all nations music speaks with an international time PuccinI's operas have a message for everyone a performance of Madame Butterfly is honored with the presence of the premier of New South Wales the Honourable RWS Caen MLA and his party who were guests of the mayor at a sparkling event understood and appreciated by every nationality in the cosmopolitan audience Rockdale counsel is always ready to assist in the district sporting activities in establishing the Bardwell Valley Golf Course it again plays an important part in developing new and improved facilities for the use of a sports minded community button park which was once almost 100 acres of low-lying land is now being reclaimed to provide several new sports fields the council is filling the muddy swamps with industrial wastes this is leveled top dressed and turfed to provide more playing areas and at no cost to the right buyers opposite Barton Park on the shores of muddy creek the Brighton fishermen's Club with its modern Clubhouse has every slipways boat repair equipment even a patrol boat everything except the catch and there's fish aplenty in the quiet waters off Botany Bay the new San Jorge police citizens boys club building nears completion designed specifically for the benefit of the younger generation the club's activities will be programmed to encourage physical fitness and mental alertness basic training for the citizens of tomorrow and Rockdale citizens have a wealth of playing areas in which to grow up this one is Gardiner Park home ground and headquarters of the sin gorge district hockey club many times champions of the Sydney metropolitan district have built a new clubhouse officially opened by the mayor aldermen gosling in September 1966 trees and Gorge hockey clubs were hosts their special guests for the weekend with a Tigers hockey club from tari in northern New South Wales this was a day to remember especially for mr. herb ribbons mr. hockey himself who thanked the large crowd for the zeal with which they participated in the grand sport of hockey there are clubs for boys and girls for young and old you can play women take their place on the sports field bowlers at the Elizabethan bowling club could be well surprised at its link with the past the land on which the Elizabethan bowling club now stands was the original homestead of the late Charles of Napa and he's dirty fast into the hands of his son and then his daughter Claire Dee who sold at about six years ago to the Elizabethan bowling club there have been many national and international tournaments held in the municipality you'll remember that the first world bones championship was held on the New South Wales leagues club greens at Kaymer bowlers from many countries were welcomed by the mayor the host nation was proud that this colorful occasion was under vice-regal patronage the mayor formally greets his Excellency the governor of New South Wales sir Owen cutter among the many champions David Bryant of England chose the faultless style that made him champion bowler of the world the waves of change that have spread across the community have stretched out to the waters of Kingsford Smith Airport include a giant game of put and take requiring the suction of thousands of tons of sand from the bottom of the bay and putting back thousands of tons of rock and concrete to form a new runway extending hundreds of yards from the shore so as not to interfere with the traffic flow on Rock Dale's Bayside highway it was necessary to depress the roadway and construct a tunnel 3 of a mile long with a roof of steel and concrete 4 feet thick on which the jumbo jets of the future can land their huge loads and perfect safety the debate as to whether the major reshaping of botany bay threatens the four shores is still unfinished but in May 1968 rain last and wind-whipped brighton beach was severely damaged three days later as the now acquired waters glistened in the sun council engineers could assess the damage to the beachfront rubble from the Bardwell Valley where the golf course was being extended was used to protect the beach and adjoining picnic areas they also reinforced large again suffer such extensive damage now Brighton Beach is once more a favorite family picnic spot over the years council has encouraged general beautification of the municipality through several carefully planned programs one such project plant a tree month is held annually following recommendations by the Forestry Commission every householder is offered one small tree which they may plant on their property the great success of these programs is reflected throughout the district and in the numerous parks and gardens to be found at every corner of Rockdale the face of rock dial is continually changing to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population the council is constantly initiating projects to expand and develop new community services housing is of first importance the Rockdale council was the first in the state to approve Villa style homes the state minister for housing the honorable st stephens mla opened a villa cylinder in august 1967 combining the advantages of an apartment unit with those of a house these villas have proved extremely popular and already over 100 more have been built modern homes have dramatically changed Valley for many years the council limited high-rise housing to three levels recently it authorized for the first time a block rising to eight levels a new style of housing for older people is nearing completion at Arncliffe sit in the grounds of one of the gracious old homes of the district these units have been carefully designed to allow residents maximum ease and comfort of living not only housing but many other community projects are altering the landscape councils engineers deal with many problems even mining this tunnel driven under Rocky Point Road at San Souci is the first stage of a major storm water channel to drain low-lying areas there are now more than 180 miles of roads in the municipality Kingsland Road is part of the continuing program of road construction and improvement the seven ways in the heart of the district has always been a traffic hazard council has not only succeeded in bringing about improvement of the flow of vehicles at this point but will complete this busy complex of thoroughfares by the installation of a war memorial fountain new international terminal building is part of a complex that will cater for air traffic so great that the present runway extending out into the bay must be lengthened and later duplicated perhaps the most significant change that has ever affected the municipality is at present in the planning stage and because of its location Rockdale is vitally concerned this model indicates the scope of the proposed changes on the four shores the Maritime Services Board is building a 1 million dollar hydraulic testing complex to study the wave action on future port and Airport developments great areas of the eastern shores of Botany Bay have already been allocated to the needs of heavy industry despite the economic and industrial advantages this redevelopment may bring to our changing community the council's first duty is to the people who live within its boundaries council will ensure that Rockdale will always be a pleasant place in which to live
 Chris get a window the motto of the municipality of Rockdale means steady advancement the application of this guiding principle over the last 80 years by generations of civic minded men started in the council gaining in 1950 the coveted Blewett memorial award it was in 1871 at the first Council of six worthy citizens then known as the council and the municipality of West motley met at the Tempe family hotel and its first meeting mr. William Yates was appointed mayor council meetings were held in private homes until in 1872 a small stone building was erected on princes highway at a cost of 104 pounds this building which stood until early 1956 was the seat of local government for the next 16 years in 1888 William George Judd was elected first mayor of the newly incorporated municipality of Rockville in that year a new Town Hall was erected on the site of the present Rockdale Town Hall expansion and development of the municipality was such that in 1940 the Rockdale town hall we know today was officially opened by his Excellency the governor Lord wakest this fine is the hub around which local civic social and cultural activity resolves within its walls history is preserved in these volumes but the work of worthy men is not only recorded in the archives their memory has kept green in the naming of parks and red lights the election of Alderman occurs each three years the candidates must be nominated by at least two in rural citizens election is then by the same democratic method of ballot by each state or federal members of parliament are elected in Rockdale what was originally a Council of six is now a Council of 15 ordered each of the five Ward's has three representatives the bear is chosen by the alderman from among their numbers for a period of one year and he may be reelected at the end of their time in his duties he is supported by a permanent staff of skilled technical and administrative officers times may have changed but the counsel of the day meets with the same unity of purpose in the same spirit of service the local government today is also big business involving large sums spending over half a million pounds on works plant and services for the benefit of the community amongst the variety of projects they undertake the construction of the other had pedestrian bridge in Mecca is just one example it was built as a safety measure and for the protection of schoolchildren of the district the cost of the structure was shared by the council and the Department of Public Works at the official opening the forum by the mayor alderman Jones and the Minister of Public Works the Honorable C Martin the mayor spoke on the importance of civic responsibility and the need for the practice of Road Safety in the fast-moving life of today the Minister for Public Works warmly supported the mayor's remarks the Ward Alderman congratulated the department and the council followed by the then Minister for education the Honorable Clyde evitt the opening of the bridge marked the completion of another public work of which Rockdale can be justly proud to the members of the council this day is the culmination of months of planning and supervision but they have a responsibility to protect the one-third of the community their needs must be served by the council the Ramsgate baby health center is a further example of the diverse responsibilities of local government the center opened in 1952 was the result of cooperative effort between the Rockdale and Congress councils and the Department of Public Health the Minister for health the Honorable mo Sullivan performed the ceremony and was presented with a memento to mark the occasion it was a proud day for the Ward Alderman they were keenly aware of the urgent need of this service mrs. O'Sullivan the wife of the minister opened the door and the official party inspected the center thanks to these health centers there are many fine young Australians preparing to take their place in the community mothers appreciate the service that these centers offer and happy motherhood is surely the foundation of a happy community care of the young citizen is continued through the kindergarten stage the opening of the Sam Suzy preschool kindergarten was a gala affair chocolate wheels and all the fun of the fair to a background of music provided by the Rockdale for the official party which included the mayor Ward aldermen state members of parliament and members of the committee who run the kindergarten this amenity is the combination of tireless work by the preschool kindergarten committee award alderman for the area and the council generally the council offices in Ward Alderman handed over to the preschool kindergarten committee the future operation of this service a team of local citizens who have the interests of work at Hutt will ensure the successful running of the kindergarten here the children will be taught various forms of self-expression in the scientific approach to the training of children today the beginnings of poise and musical appreciation are developed through rhythm planing in manual dexterity and developing creative talent is all part of the plan they're a young artists give their interpretation of color and form the children are encouraged to use their imagination this results in some very unusual canvases the ornament of Rockdale used their imagination in establishing the kindergarten and anklet the old fire station had been converted and a new building entered when the mayor aldermen Gosling opened the these men as the council motto suggests are steadily advancing and meeting the needs of a growing community and once again the local citizens respond by accepting the responsibility for the efficient running of the organization the on cliff children were obviously enthusiastic as their presentation of Thursday's to the Lady Mayoress was totally unrehearsed the school is open daily and beside developing young minds the children are encouraged to have plenty of exercise and fresh air in the bright Australian sunshine mothers can have confidence in sending their children to these centres today there are five daily health centres and for preschool kindergartens that work in the municipality the raising of healthy and happy young Australians is a vital obligation the far-seeing council sees to it that every possible protection is available against infectious and dangerous diseases it endeavors to ensure that all children in its area are protected by immunization citizens have been and are being immunized against the ravages of this disease healthy youngsters must have recreation facilities and the council is prepared to serve the youth of the community in every possible way recently when cricket officials and enthusiasts gathered in force the council in the aldermen in his area these modern practice facilities have been erected helped to this project of theirs will produce future champion the mayor said that the installation of permanent practice wickets was unique in that there were the first of their kind in the metropolitan area the official editing was completed when the mayor sent down the first ball a sizzling barrel of traffic length that had the batsman air disadvantaged the unclipped Junior cricket team already with cricketing honors to their credit were eager to try out Bennett's the first ball suitably inscribed was presented to alderman Gosling a memento of a memorable occasion the formal proceedings being over the boy is lost no time in taking advantage of expert advice to improve their style in skill for many years tailor sketching has been a feature of the Rockdale municipal courts it is by such encouragement that outstanding players in this sport are produced and the adolescent of the day may well be the champion of tomorrow in 1953 the Australian hardcore Championships were the big crowd settled down to an afternoon of temps excitement play began with local girl Beryl Penrose and mrs. Horton in the women's finals the Rockdale girl Daryl Penrose went on to win the Australian championship the championships also brought to the court two young players in Lew Hoad and Ken Russell to match their skill against seasoned international veterans civil and Ravitch the finals of the Australian doubles hardcore championship was a brilliant display of court craft the crowd cheered a victory for herd and Roseville whose all-round mastery made them the new title holders lowest herd and John Brahm it's worthy contenders for the singles title and a display of all-round striking youthful vigor and speed one for him this match which provided some of the best tennis of the championship after the presentation of the trophies the council invited players and officials to a civic reception at the Town Hall but physical activities must be balanced with mental and cultural development with this in mind the Rockdale council sponsored its first art award exhibition in the coronation and Elisabeth halls in of art alderman Saunders introduced the prominent artist an art critic Douglas Dundas who was the judge of the exhibition prizes for the winning entries were presented to the artist by mr. Charles Mercer's who entertained the audience with his informal address although the standard of out achieve was reasonably high perhaps the most important feature of the exhibition was the large number of entries received approximately 300 of which about 150 were hung there were also about 1800 in the children's section a fine reward indeed to the aldermen of the council who are giving every encouragement to local artists mr. Mehra's amused the audience by the warmth of his congratulations to certain of the winners success of the ventures shared that young people can be encouraged to develop another the arts in a world where material values so often ever shadow the aesthetic a mobile library developed from the council's desire to create a demand for worthwhile reading not even the rain dampened the enthusiasm of the council on the occasion of the official acting of the unit in November 1955 the mayor the Honorable jf McGraw MLA he congratulated Rockdale on its progressive approach to the problem of housing a collection of worthwhile literature in a small space the library carried 4,500 books the numerous stopping places where readers of all ages await its arrival it has a large section devoted to students reference and textbooks and do-it-yourself section and of course volumes of fiction and nonfiction membership which is free is confined to Rockdale residents and children attending schools in its area reading is surely one of the most pleasant forms of relaxation but finding a quiet spot in a busy commercial center where tire choppers may relax is rather unusual the council has built this modern woman's rest enter for housewives and mothers attractive lounges are provided light refreshments may be enjoyed in quiet and tasteful surroundings every facility is available for freshening up after shopping a feature of the center is the meeting room where organizations engaged in civic educational and charitable fields may gather classes in arts and domestic crafts are also conducted here the Center has been widely used in tutoring by His Excellency the John dedicated the building and then unveiled the plaque the large crowds that attended the opening shared that the Alderman's efforts to provide this facility were appreciated they were immensely proud to have the Queen's first a representative present on this occasion in the coronation year well loyalty to the crown is a key note of local government and council have been happy to assume the responsibility of conducting naturalization ceremonies here the two of these took place in the cold and cheerless atmosphere of the courts but are now performed in the friendly surroundings of the council chamber new citizens renounce their former allegiance and swear allegiance to the crown as Australian citizens the near alderman Gosling officiated the ceremony which welcomed new settlers in June 1956 the mayor evidently found difficulty in the pronunciation of some of the names as he handed to our new friends their certificates of Australian citizenships together with the Bible upon which the earth was taken and a brochure from the good neighbor council a local member of the state parliament mr. Eric Willis and federal member mr Bruce on behalf of the state and federal governments mrs. Frank brown representing the good neighbor Council outlined some of the privileges and responsibilities of new citizens our friends come amongst us bringing the culture of older lands and no doubt new thoughts the opportunity is here for them to take their place in the community to join in voluntary service through local government the Civic fathers of Rockdale have guided the municipality from the horse and buggy days to the threshold of the Atomic Age there are plans for the years that lie ahead and the pattern for the future Rockdale forms part of the herd Cumberland County Council Clem this huge map shows the rezoning of the municipality the red sections are area set aside for redevelopment the purple shading denotes industrial areas residential areas are indicated in pink parklands in green the mayor of rock Dale is about to make a survey of the municipality using ultra modern methods of transport let's go up with him to get a new angle on the rock tale of today and a vision of the future our map areas in Syria dranks along the miles of red waves in the municipality council planning has reserved areas of parkland preserving for all time places for relaxation and recreation for the people on the plan we can see how further areas are to be added for the use and pleasure of future citizens moving across the map we come to a section painted purple where an industrial area will be developed this will call for more help plans are underway for residential development roads have already been made for the new home sites all the plans are not for the distant future this disused quarry will be transformed private enterprise has been persuaded to purchase the area and town planning experts are now engaged in the creation of the project along the face of a wide carriageway to be constructed by the council will be built a modern service station a series of eight shops and the hotel building of unique design parking problems of the future are cared for by the provision of a large parking area for more than 90 cars transport of the future is construction of an expressway that will pass through the municipality rent intersections built along the lines of this sketch will allow vehicles to feed in and out of the expressway without interfering with the flow of high-speed traffic airborne travelers of the future will see an Tarin point six lanes of traffic leaving the municipality over a wide bridge the present four-lane Marine Drive can feed vehicles in and out of the municipality at the rate of 180 a minute serving the beachfront the golden edge of botany bay the Rockdale citizen of tomorrow will get this sort of view when he pops down to the beach to connect young John or Harry from the Brighton The Sands municipal baths but while we're up in our Ariel perch let's move inland and study the traffic pattern on the present highway even in off-peak hours it's obvious the ribbon development that touches the red with shops and factories must cause congestion bottlenecks are created by the many intersections this road will change and the landmarks will change as the years roll by but here in the their own time continuing the practice of being good neighbors to 76,000 people in the municipality since a handful of men elected the first council in 1871 the ever-increasing population has looked to their representatives to guide the development of the municipality the return of the helicopter is symbolic of local government or it is down-to-earth government the mayor and the Alderman following the precept of steady advancement know that this guiding principle will bring even greater achievement in the years to come

Hi Tom how I well let how about you yeah well thank you've got a great little veggie fest here thank you I like drunk bearing been a homegrown food yes I'm veg better I do have a trouble fruit fly and it's been more and more troublesome that's over the last two or three years I would have been lucky to get one tomorrow off my tomatoes last year so disappointed yeah I was trying the trapping for fruit fly in the trees but that seemed to help from the year before but it still wasn't enough to keep them out of the tomatoes trapping is really good it's a really good on way of monitoring if you've got fruit fly and I think it's part of the whole process I always use a netting and its really is a foolproof way of growing tomatoes our any fruit that are affected by fruit play this netting here is special sort of knitting it's UV stabilized and it has really small holes in it so fruit fly can't get through 10 by sixes 20 by sixes I can get them in boxes which are two and a half meters by two and a half days which any idea whatever one yeah exactly yes and if you've got if you've got a tree a large tree like your lemon or your for joy there yeah these bigger ones are really good as well okay yeah so the netting also has other benefits too it also is good for keeping out other insects like green vegetable bugs yes um it's also good for keeping out birds possums yep gets a bit of the Sun off as well good shady maybe help with their was been for hail storm yes exactly that's right and if you're doing a tree you can just drape it over the tree and then tie it with a piece of sleeping around the bottom other than putting four posts in your vegetable garden you can also get polypipe okay and you can you can tape the poly pipe on or wire it on yep and make sort of a bit of a loop make a bit of the house help hold the net up yeah definitely the netting obviously stops the pollinate as visiting your plants so things like tomatoes capsicums chillies and eggplants yep they're also pollinating so they will be fine under the net okay but if by chance you just happened to sneak in a little zucchini in a sphere corner somewhere under the netting yeah you probably won't get many zucchinis because they need insects de pronto okay and if you were doing a fruit tree yep which would require insect to help pollinate you would need to put the netting on after the petals have dropped these nets were usually lasts through a lot same net for six or seven years you can actually just stitch them up with a little bit of fishing line but for steel post which is really easy and I always just put it be to the cap on the top there because these steel posts have got really sharp edges on them and they tend to rip the net yeah that's right you can also buy special caps that so any of those around yeah that's really easy like it's as you can see it's not very hard to do and I always just put a brick on a couple of corners and once it's done you sorted you want to go in topeka tomorrow as you just go in under the netting you can pick your proof and then you just get back out again it's special fruit growing netting so it's quite fine so insects can't get through yep you know obviously bird netting they're going to get through that yeah and you can get it from lots of retailers and is there anything you need to particularly pay attention for when you buying this type of netting make sure it's UV stabilized and things like that just you yeah that would be the main thing UV stabilized and that it is a veggie netting originating its that's suitable for fruit fly it's also really important to consider the height of your tree if your tree is really big too big to manage then you really is really good if you're wanting to make your train as well you
What advice would you give someone looking to run for council I would tell them to not even contemplate entering council if they've got a an agenda well you've got to have a community interest awesome passion for their community you must understand that you're here to represent the shire not the town where you live and this council has always enjoyed a very collegiate approach the willingness to um listen and learn from your community and working hand in hand put yourself out there and get yourself elected that's a and it's one of the best things you can do for yourself just just go and do it what has challenged you as a councillor as a councillor obviously we face many challenges and a lot of them aren't our own doing obviously we're bound by state legislation and federal government implications as well conflicts and may and mainly those conflicts are coming from people you know and that you you've been friendly with them trying to keep all the communities on the same page keep them all happy which is the biggest challenges for a councillor is that you see so many things you'd like to be doing within the shower but money constraints and time constraints and um you know often even opposition from the constituents can see those projects not reach fruition um challenges are presented every day but the beauty of working with your community is being able to work through those challenges we've had divisions in the community and that's been the most difficult part over infrastructure that's been the most difficult part is my time here as a counselor but it's been resolved now and um moving forward I think it was probably for the best what has been your most enjoyable role as a counsellor my most enjoyable role as a cancer would be being involved in the community I think being able to rep represent uh the local people and the the going to conferences and the social events that we've had it's given me a fantastic opportunity to get to know a lot of people in other towns being able to represent your community across what their issues are and being able to implement them at a council level is one of the most enjoyable things that I've found over the last 13 years what is your most proudest achievement as a counsellor badass achievements as a cancer there's been been so many that we've had is getting infrastructure completed getting the the four towns with four new football club and community areas um as working as a team first of all is one of the most proudest things that we do we all work together to toward better cause and make barrigan a better shot most important things that's occurred for this show probably in the last 20 years was our avoidance of amalgamation but one of the um most gratifying things I've found is working for a team was not being merged not being merged was something that we're really really proud of was in the berrigan shire obviously we were proposed to be merged with the druitery council we were willing to work through that um however we you know we we got great representation and of berrigan to make sure that we weren't merged and that holds us in a great place going forward well there's been quite a few of those I mean while I've been on council we lobbied for the uh uh the new building in town on the foreshore the restaurant and we also lobbied for the splash park we also lobbied for the uh museum the aero museum as well so avoid that amalgamation I think is just a marvelous achievement yeah look many and varied proud moments in council there's too many to mention but it's been a ride in one word sum up what it is to be a counsellor understanding privilege challenging rewarding you
Move myself and my family down to Tokyo more three years ago now from Sydney with the idea of a change of lifestyle and giving ourselves from the perspective of the business an opportunity to rethink what we've been doing as a business for 30 years and giving myself that opportunity to have space to develop different areas within different crafts that I didn't definitely have the opportunity to do in Sydney in Studio Cydonia specializes in large-scale architectural artwork the studio has done a variety of work most hospitals have a peace of mind somewhere in the foyer the decadence about being out here and buying a property give is a massive sight especially from an industrial landscape and this space here will end up being a gallery being able to create some large-scale wood-fired kilns for ceramics trying to do that in the city is never going to happen out here there's basically no restrictions literally everywhere I go if I find an interesting piece of wood piece of rusty steel I collect components for future works I have not seen in Sydney for 25 to have the time to put back into the community that I haven't had for a long time in Sydney because in Sydney I was basically survival mode every day and the primary schools are just so sweet and it's really nice to be in that scenario to give the kids that sort of an opportunity to grow up in real Australia
Looking for a holiday closer to home come check it out oh I wanna show you something about the way so won't you take oh oh now the waves are at your feet planning your next family holiday come visit us in tomorrow cobra beruga finley and berrigan
 we started the bush liner buses company in Melbourne and the idea it was to have towards the winery towards the brewery tour is that sort of thing running around Melbourne with the idea of bringing it up to Tokyo Mall during the peak periods because we identified that there was a gap in the market all the pubs used to have courtesy buses and over the years that stopped happening and instead what happened was we bought the business up here in about October last year to try it during a quiet weekend and it kind of just went nuts from there so we've been doing it since then consistently every weekend with the occasional festival and group tour activity as well we get a lot of birthday parties that go into the pubs for their birthdays indoor farms with a lot of farms where we go how they have big parties at the shed we did a big wedding daddy cooter boot no they had 60 or 70 of people down there at the just did the shop appear to be there and we all the good we've done a full-on wedding where we've had the bride and taken the groom and all the people there we had photos dutiable of water as it cools down we'd still like to offer there the locals and any visitors that come through winter some different things to do local footy that the trips away we can we've got two buses we've got a 13 cedar in a 24 cedar so we can fill them both up and take them to the away games or maybe a weekend down to Melbourne take them on a footy trip down to Melbourne we're also planning on doing some winery tours there's some there's a winery walkabout in Rutherglen during winter I believe that there's a Jazz Festival happening in itsuka which we're gearing up for as well so we just hope to be able to offer different types of activities to keep people out and about during the winter as well so at the end of the day bush line of buses and everyone in town knows this is the toke to do and see more when they come to visit toka more from the surrounding areas
Hi my name's Matt Hannon and I'm very very shy at the moment we're facing a massive challenges both economically socially and on the health front we will get through these challenges if we do stick to the rules that have been put in place by the state and federal governments and the advice of the medical experts we need to avoid unnecessary trouble and we need to adhere to the social distancing rules if we do these things we will slow the spread of the virus down obviously there are many challenges with our schools and and our businesses being affected however if we can support those businesses that are still open and be ready to support the businesses that will reopen we will get back to some sort of normality sooner rather than later there'll be some short-term pain but there'll be some long-term gain in the future we need to look out for our elderly and most vulnerable residents at this time and do what we can in a safe manner there we need to be in contact with our parents and they know that we're looking out for them and I've got their back we need to massive effort by our medical professions and our teaching fraternity in what they are doing to make sure that we are safe and our children are learning at the moment I'll say again that if we just adhere to these these measures of the pudding we work we may will experience some disruption to our lives but in the future we're gonna we're going to prosper from this so let's stay safe let's look after each other and let's get through this all together thank you
 we've traveled Australian Europe try and find out where we're going to spend the next so many years afterwards we've managed a caravan park not far from here and kept coming to beragon to have a look and fell in love with the town so we put us a mission to the shower to take over the park and put infrastructure in buildings cabins and basically boost the town the best we could where we're sitting now in this whole area was full of basically weeds we put watering systems in and slowly one by one bought one cabin bought the next cabin lived in one it's been really worthwhile being crown land everything's drifted through the Shire and the show has been more than helpful so you're basically talking to the person with a phone call immediately and if you can't do that you may seem down the street that's the beauty of coming to a place like this with thousand people you cut through a lot of stuff quickly which we enjoy it all works hand in hand it's freedom and you can be part of the community everything's here there's a hospital across the road there's a lot of opportunities here I do other work and so does my wife apart from the park and that's true word-of-mouth and just knowing people and talking to people so it's a community environment that's what we like
We just love the community we think that beragon has everything to offer that we need to and the community itself in regards to different activities that the children can do over the weekend there's the new playground varuga and of course the splash park in toka mall which are great additions to our Shire which make a big difference for families and children because there's plenty for them to do particularly over the weekend storytime is an opportunity for mums and younger children to go visit the library and I do know that my wife is to go along to those sessions and enjoyed the opportunity to meet other mothers in the community and also interact with the children get to know each other basically so build relationships which is really important the opportunities the children get in our small school is amazing and we have lots of Technology the children get to interact with a garden we've got chickens there's plenty of space for them to move around it is like having your own little classroom so you do know every child very very they get treated like individuals and that's what's really important in a small school our daughter had open-heart surgery at the age of six months most of her surgery was performed in Melbourne at the Royal Children's Hospital however with all of her ongoing treatment hospital he was able to deal with those things she had to have a nasal gastric tube after realizing we needed their support they went and got all the nurses trained to be I want to perform that procedure so that next time if we needed that support they were able to do that there are lots of advantages when choosing a small school particularly in this area you
 moved away to Aubrey did a few years at University and moved back here it's quite a nice and casual lifestyle here in beragon I moved down here from Queensland but before then I actually grew up in Melbourne makes my days much more pleasurable than when I was traveling 45 minutes to and from work at a minimum but one of the things about working in rural I hope I'm a million particular in small towns is the fact that I see the people I interact with daily for me that gives me a great sense of satisfaction knowing that I'm part of things that have made a difference we have lots of professionals solicitors pharmacists doctors accountants I used to work as an accountant and then decided I wanted to change the scenery and that's one of the good things about being in the country is that you can shift and change and people get to know what your personality is like it's like sense of community being able to walk down the street raising children it's safer so I know's always watching out to make sure they make it home if I'm at work a few my friends have moved over to our long if they come over on a working out of it so they said what do you do when you finish I set it off knowledge that they said come oten and pay a visit and I did so I got a job here in beragon probably after six months recently been appointed the director of technical services for varying Shire and I'm very grateful to to have that opportunity it's very different to working in a city or in your res never in my wildest dreams that I think I'd be a manager of an aerodrome looking after a landfill as designing carbon go towards strong water involved with water and sewer you walk down the street everybody nausea and it's great your neighbors look after your garden while you're away on holidays and it's just a great little community
And the nominated supervisor director at from the Early Learning Center we are a 23 place center we offer early education from 6 weeks of age to 5 years so we're about making children feel safe and getting them ready to learn how to learn so we want to get them to learn their social skills and how to play with friends and how to share how to draw before they go to school I really noticed how if you can get a positive start to schooling and get children excited about school and really get them to start to love learning then half the challenge is gone once we found out we were pregnant with our first child we decided to move back from McCoy just to offer our boys the upbringing that we had so in a nice community where we would know everyone and we'd know that they would have the stoy same sort of opportunities that we do so the schooling the sport all the facilities that a little town has to offer and once I got here we realized that there was no back teaching in the primary schools my mum had him so mum and I decided we'd open a chocolates in her hour we've had a lot of community supports it's been a really a welcome addition to the community

 I've been made the president of the Football Netball Club at Tokyo mall it's just a fantastic opportunity for the kids of toka mall we've got over a hundred junior kids involved in the club but we were very lucky here that on Saturday we play all grades of netball and football at one location sometimes it might be an early start but you still get to spend the day with the whole family enjoy the sport across the netball and football the importance of a football netball club as a community was pointed out to me by my nine-year-old son when he wrote a speech the total football ground is a place you can train yourself to be better at sports like cross country football athletics netball tests and cricket when I'm at the Tokyo football ground I'm usually doing football training but sometimes I'm there practicing for cross country and athletics I can be the best I can now after all the things I've told you about turkey football breath close your eyes and imagine it was gone now you Tokyo football ground is my favorite place in a local area our eldest daughter boards in Aubree during the week so she's home on the weekend to play sport I do enjoy coming back on the weekends especially like for netball because I can catch up with my friends watch my sister pineapple I can watch my brothers playing football and then I can play my game the kids come here and and just get involved with leaders and people who have one goal in common and that's to produce kids with good skills across the netball and football range you
 we're a non-for-profit aged care facility in the town of beragon when a group of local people got together and decided that they wanted the older generation to stay in the town so they got together and decided to create this fantastic organization that we now have I suppose that the reason that the business is so successful is because it's a community run business and its locals looking after locals do you know that older generation has a lot to offer and they still valued members of our community and so by being local we have the ability to keep those people in their community and involved in their community as much as we possibly can having lived in Melbourne for a period of time with my husband and my two children we decided to move back up to beragon and I think it was that sense of community that really drew us to stay it's not just your job it's connection that you have with people we haven't looked back really it's been fantastic you know it's a great place country you can't get a job but there's really good jobs as far as educating people and also giving them opportunity to grow in their own environment
 when I have retired I would never have considered playing golf in Melbourne but moving up here there's so many golf courses around and they're so close we've got a hundred and eight holes within a 30 minute drive at Cobra Moruga so we're really spoilt for choice that price is a fantastic compared to Melbourne we have everything here and we're not professional golfers we just do it sort of fun in between holes where we have a few laughs and jokes in the morning you know obviously have a nice relaxed breakfast do a bit of housework but nine times out of ten three days a week is golf golf isn't just for the men we usually have around 40 to 50 ladies play on a Wednesday player 18 holes of golf and then we come in and it's wonderful social atmosphere in the clubhouse afterwards I'd have to love it because I'm not a really good golfer but I enjoy going out and meeting new people and playing and it's good exercise yeah we only came thought I'd play golf in my life and I'm hopeful we came up here from Melbourne like a lot of people do for retirement and god

 my name's scott Aldred I'm the director and founder of traveling podiatrists it was founded in the end of 2017 after I graduated from Charles Sturt University and was essentially created to address the shortages in allied health services Australia my main business is focused around the beragon Shire with my head office in Tokyo more my scope in my trouble is I mean the beragon Shire you know every Monday Tuesday Wednesday with clinics in Tokyo mall Finlay Berrigan coverin and jewelry and usually for the rest of the week I'm Eva all the way down in Aurora providing services or I'm up in Albury Wodonga banila Wangaratta and Beechworth in the academia so when I first started the business it was mainly focused on providing home visits in the beragon Shire gained a grasp of whether or not there was a solid interest in the business and sort of as demand grew for the business for the services that's when the local medical facilities in the area got in contact with me each day I'm working from a different clinic with clients that who do need it and they can't get out of the house or can't travel 20 kilometres to the closest town in the future I hope to expand further possibly look at franchising the travelling podiatrist interstate as well I really like to thank for the local community from embracing the troubling podiatrist simulator enabling me to fully facilitate the demand for podiatry services in the area and to make this into a fully fledged business which requires full-time work
The region's Health Service concedes it's denilla Qin base drug and alcohol component is less than ideal with only one counselor covering an area of more than 26,000 square kilometres while the closest detoxification and residential treatment program is in Wagga there's a small resource we'd love to have more resources but as far as I'm aware they're not available currently it spurred the southern riverina community into action fearing the ice epidemic is only going to worsen the berrigan's Shire Council's youth development committee is heading a call to arms for a combined service club effort to ensure clubs public events and each home in the region is free of methamphetamine we can actually look at what resources do we already have in our local community and how can we take forward a plan to be ice free dr. Wigan is firm there are no plans to reduce its drug and alcohol service despite its plan to 2019 including the introduction of a specific training component for its mental health workers and a plan to withdraw from preventative education I plans to try and enhance it and support it better in the meantime those wishing to take part in the barragan shire ice freeze own initiative can attend a meeting being held later this month we're actually talking about individuals being ice free so I suppose that notion of being ice-free is for our community or being able to reach out and support people suan become see wind news

 my name is Marcus naka I'm the manager at a farm in beragon in in 2009 when you purchased the farm it was an old potato farm when we brought it and turns it into a hundred and forty hectares of fresh citrus things that we do differently here that many places don't is we we grow new varieties such as the Samoa mandarine we're one of the largest growers of the variety they're an interesting piece of fruit they spark a lot of interests in conversation and investment as well we supply mid to late season markets mainly the varieties that we've chosen to grow on the property we've mainly focused on having seedless varieties seedless lemons seedless mandarines and also the valencies as well in navels that's a focus these days it's more consumer driven they chase a higher market as well our growing practices we use an open hydroponics setup so we're giving the trees a little bit of fertilizer just about every day modern pruning techniques and being more environmentally aware and using less pesticides and property since then the plan has been to continue growing the property we're planting another 60 to 70 hectares this year looking to purchase and develop more land in the area the benefit is having these guys on board that have got great knowledge in the industry using different techniques and sharing ideas we're sharing them now across the other side of the world is helping us improve our quality it's helping us improve our production and in turn with we're also helping them guys it's a very exciting time in the industry and we want to be seen as a leader in producing clean green tasty fruit and developing more people in the area in this theater work
We had been farming and irrigating with the irrigators growing irrigated crops and then the drought come around dad mentioned to me would you be interested in maybe having a go at importing some machinery and that's how it all come about it was sort of more a matter of looking for something else to do instead of farming and it's just expanded and grown since then and I really enjoy selling and other companies have come to us and seeing that we provide good service and and good stocking levels having that local knowledge and having that knowledge about farming has really helped farmers with their products and and see what they need it's really been a good marriage of sort of two things gives me a lot of satisfaction knowing that it's supporting not only the 25 people that are working here but supporting their families and then supporting local economy to Finley and Berrigan sharp particular I mean I live in Tokyo it's a nice place to live on the river ruse just dad had so many boxes that were ticked for why we set up here look I think it's a good work culture here some of the time that is maybe a product of being out in the country where people a little bit more relaxed I sometimes think about remote businesses that could be set up in the city that are only doing paperwork so much is on the internet now why couldn't someone have this lifestyle and still be doing a city type job I do love living in the country you
But we have the main club here the Berger sports club it obviously has everything with a clubhouse that we have dining bar gaming keno tab we have the Cobra muruga Golf Club plus function facilities for weddings conferences so forth and we have the Sportage health and fitness which has a 25 motor indoor pool fully equipped gym and basketball court and finally we have our bowls Sporty's bowls which has to synthetic greens and club hair see I've been very fortunate with opportunity and the faith and the confidence of people of Hadding has allowed me to progress from being a plumber and not having any real managerial experience to 20 years later fern provided the chance to lead a fantastic organization and the basis of the Sporty's group is to have a close connection with community and especially in rural you you get involved so it's not just about being involved in your workspace and with your employer but it's about being involved in the community on a broader sense copper and Berger area is a very unique people look at it're coming to a town like this but when they get here they look at it and they go I can't believe you have this we're proud of what we've got but we know it's built on the back of the community and you know a fantastic shy that's proactive in providing this helping us to provide that but it's also on the back of this club as well you
We were the first enduro frame roll former in the world in tow Kemal and we're in a great position at the moment to grow the business from a small little town in tow Kemal we've actually got a world footprint in just taking the early adoption of the enduro frame and steel frame system I traveled and experienced city life European life I always knew that my family I would want to bring up in a community like tow Kemal it's just a lovely environment and I see it as a fantastic opportunity to bring people into this community educated people and grow my business and in turn grow the town my business is 15 families involved in it and that's fantastic for the beragon Shire and the community everyone would know who lives or has lived in the city commuting is a massive issue and you can get to work anywhere in this community in a short period of time the future of this business in the last three years we've been involved in potential joint ventures potential takeovers and those all those move to a major area but my goal aim and promises to try and keep this business in total as long as I can and to grow it and we're taking steps towards that near you
I was born and bred in Finley in February 2009 we made the decision to take over PGG rights ins and it became us a real estate it was a big leap of faith but very rewarding I couldn't have done it without the support of the locals and having family behind us but this mainly been in a small town allows for community support where two mouths it's certainly a huge part in a small business I do on farm repairs for predominantly just harvesters most of my work comes from word of mouth I don't have to advertise for that reason and the amount of work that is out there is phenomenal the beauty of having my own business allows me to spend time with my family but also do what I love you know like going out to ride my horses we have a small farm that's a on the side thing that's a passion of have a house I think the the beragon Shire you know it's in a great location close to the bigger cities it's a great great facilities doctors schools everything really there's not much that needs to be bought out of town and it's great to support local businesses
A viewer your family been considering a tree change but not sure where to start or unsure of job opportunities let me introduce you to beragon Shire less than three hours north of Melbourne and situated on the gorgeous banks of the Murray River here are just a few of the stories from people who have moved to come back to or just stayed in the region to live work and invest we moved up here about five years ago when we run a coffee shop in baraja found a house in taupe which was really easy found jobs which was way too easy for what we what we wanted to do we weren't really came for that at the time that everything just seemed to fall in a place once we decided that was it that was it we originally came up here and ran the PMB once we got it established and opened their doors that it went ahead and with great support from the local community and that community generally welcomes anyone to run your own business have here it probably was easier to set up bureaucracy is more welcoming if people have some understanding of what they're about to do if they come with a reasonable plan they will get the support of the community once I got here we realized that there was no childcare it was only family daycare so mum and I decided we'd open a chocolates enough we've had a lot of community supports it's been a really a welcome addition to the community we are a 23 place center we offer early education from six weeks of age to five years remove myself and my family down to Tokyo more three years ago now from Sydney with the idea of a change of lifestyle the studio Cydonia specializes in large-scale architectural artwork the decadence about being out here and buying a property it is a massive site especially from an industrial landscape and this space here will end up being a gallery out here there's basically no restrictions since moving to Tokyo mall I've been able to have the time to put back into the community that I haven't had for a long I first graduated from pharmacy college beragon didn't have a pharmacy at that time so business partners and I started up the beragon pharmacy the cost of bringing up a family in particular is a lot more affordable what we would like to expand our business is to try and encourage more pharmacists to come from the cities there is that ability to have a good work-life balance because of the social activities that we can partake in around here being in a small town allows for community support where two mouths it's certainly a huge part in a small business I do on farm repairs predominantly just harvesters most of my work comes from word of mouth I don't have to advertise for that reason and the amount of work that is out there is phenomenal the beauty of having my own business allows me to spend time with my family but also do what I love while moving to Bergen Shire is a smart move for small businesses it's also a great place for raising children once we found out we were pregnant with just to offer our boys the upbringing that we had and the primary schools are just so sweet and it's really nice to be in that scenario to give the kids that sort of opportunity to grow up in real Australia as well as the community feel and the support for small businesses in the area there's also the incentive of being right on the banks of the Murray River is just there there's that many beaches people can camp on and as the weather's good boats will be air as you can see the towns of the beragon shy have just about everything you could want the feel of a small town with the facilities and opportunities of a city the life balance and sense of community is second to none and the opportunities and possibilities are endless come and visit and see for yourself you
One of the really important parts of fruit fly control is your garden hygiene if you have fruit trees in your back garden and you have got fruit fly or your fruit is just dropping it's really important that you pick up your fruit and dispose of it correctly one of the better ways of doing it is to bag it in just your garden bags and leave it out in the Sun that's what it's called solar izing the fruit so what the Sun does is it basically cooks the maggots or the larvae that are inside the fruit so that they're not continuing their lifecycle if you're a bit unsure about how thick the plastic is you might want to get to and double-bag it but you wouldn't just pick your fruit up from the bottom of the tree and place it in your compost bin or in your worm farm because that will just continue the lifecycle of the fruit fly it's also really important that if you are picking up your your foot infected fruit off the ground and rest of your fruit off your tree as well because it's probably infected too so it's too late now to control it your best thing now is to take it off and bag all the fruit of the tree you
The world is coming we are on our way 80 cities we can't wait to get the snippy NIAMS downstage 30 nations see you sir New Zealand's five 1500 apples lake macquarie international children's games coming this december hey everyone sorry we can't_''_45.149 be there with you guys tonight we have our school dance on and we reach on between coming and speaking with you guys are going to one of our social highlights ger thankfully with technology we can come and share our experiences with you tonight even if we're not there in person sir thank you on saturday the six of December 2014 8 Simmons for athletes to coaches and our head of delegation break the 6am start to meet the bus and begin the 11 hour trip to Lake Macquarie in order to take our place at the international children's games as we boarded we were excited somewhere a little overwhelmed and to be honest as teenagers many of us were just looking to sleep but this was not the start of our journey it actually commenced at the beginning of cool morning to reach that bus it took the commitment of many people it took the work of Joanna often of the berrigan's I'll to help our dreams become reality the planning of fundraising by our parents the support of local businesses and most importantly the willingness of local service clubs to take a risk and sponsor our participation for the commitment and dedication we wish to try and express our gratitude for investing in us the youth of barragan trail to help us participate in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because of your generosity we got to wear the green and gold to have the name of our country on our back to bear the logo of our Shire and to tell kids all around the world that we do actually live in a place where we see kangaroos and koalas in the wild we may have exaggerated some of those stories a little bit though we hope that we are not the only group from this area to have this opportunity we would dearly love that more young people have the chance to participate in the same amazing and go to Taiwan not bath some kids from the southern river arena so what are the international children's games and why did we attend well let's be honest we are not potential international champions who are we kidding we're not even national champions but this is not what the international children's games are about or I see Jesus for short even though they are part of the Olympic Committee in fact the I CGS goes back to the Cold War in 1968 when a physical education teacher living in Slovenia had a vision to encourage peace and goodwill amongst children of different cultural backgrounds he saw a sport he saw sport is a great way to facilitate this exchange from the first games in which nine towns took part the icg s has grown to an impressive event with more than 400 cities from five continents participating and embracing the original idea to promote peace and understanding in 2014 the kids at barragan trial were one of these teams and we loved it many of us went to these games understanding how important they are world where we are taught to be afraid of difference the ICTs helped us to realize the importance of insult of celebrating difference we got to hear about the different ways of life and embrace rather than feed kids the great thing about not being potential medalists is that we were able to fully embrace the cultural interaction we were there to do our best get some PBS but we went there with the goal to learn as much as about kids from around the world as we could as you can imagine when you put approximately 1500 kids together aged between 12 and 15 years there is a lot to say well as country kids we were happy to get involved and meet as many people as we could this is not to say that we didn't take the competition seriously we certainly do many of us had been training for months beforehand in order to do our best now in swimming we measure everything by personal bests or PBS well we certainly appeal we certainly achieved the PB goal in the pool out of 23 individual events account the many PBS for within our relay legs we had similar success in the athletics we may not have made the finals but they gave us the time to meet up with others from around the world the I CGS has a great tradition of exchanging badges now this is great on two fronts one we all got to walk away with souvenirs from around the world we've brought some of these with us today if you'd like to look at them at the end but secondly and most importantly it was a great icebreaker after our 11 hour bus trip we dumped our bags grabbed our badges and joined the hordes of kids outside our accommodation at the University of Newcastle the race was on to exchange as many badges from as many different teams as possible there was no time to be shy our first day was training followed by the opening ceremony all the teams arrived early marshaling and exchanging team photos with one another then the ceremony began it was filled with music and entertainment barragan Shire had the honor of being the we walked out and saw the thousand thousands in the audience and massive film cameras for the live telecast around the world we were nervous excited but so proud to be wearing the green in gold in our aim to embrace the experience we started the dancing of all the athletes when Christina our new saying my Island home unfortunately the night came to an abrupt end when the heavens opened and Lake Macquarie was hit by an enormous thunderstorm as an outdoor event we were evacuated sounds like the night should have been ruined right it just added to the excitement of our experience as we left running through the rain and later showing our Aussie tattoos with those around us on the bus trip home those such uniforms came in handy applying the tattoos a day is quickly formed a great routine mornings were dedicated to competition afternoons to seeing some other sports and socializing with our new friends by just chatting or playing in form with games of footy the evenings were organized activities to promote ongoing friendships and exchange these included a movie night wildlife experience in the waves with a belly full of meat pies and sausage rolls a nice continue beyond the formal events for some of us that involve the challenge of playing cards with the Germans with little common language and a pack of German cards a lot of our team watch movies with others and many of us took the chance to just talk our sign language skills have improved in the age of social media many of us has stayed in contact and lifelong friendships across the world have been made Facebook is fantastic most of the time our final evening concluded the games with a sense of sadness at the closing ceremony after the end of the formal proceedings we continued the party with a rave dancing long into the night while back at the accommodation a small shower had a mini party of its own so what did we learn from our experience so much most of us come from hard-working families who don't have huge amounts of cash to spare many of us struggle to get out of our Shire with any regularity let alone travel us to experience so much they gave us the world they literally gave us the world where else could we meet so many people where else when most of us play cards with the Germans and go with the Israelis where else could we dance the night away with forth with kids from 400 cities where else would any of us participate in the sporting event on an international scale we desperately hope that another group of buried and triathletes can also have this experience words cannot describe our gratitude for the world that the shake our parents and service clubs gave us and the investment that they made in a bunch of kids from our local Shire in changing our world maybe we can learn to make a better world we hope that young people have the opportunity to share this experience with others and we get to impact the future for the better thank you and good night Oh snap what Oh

Introducing ground crew pilot and federal minister Susan Lee's political journey has taken her from country to cabinet representing a seat stretching from Victoria to Queensland she considers her pilot's license and electorate essential I'm usually in paint by myself and it always feels very good as my staff say I go off the reservation she cut her pilots teeth mustering livestock from above we're right to go flying takes the former farmer back in barragan population 920 mayor burner curtains upbeat about the challenge of getting politicians attention the big issue we have is trying to explain to them where we geographically are at the town's clinic susan lee is member and minister the task about to get harder electoral boundaries are again being redrawn this year western australia will gain a seat New South Wales will lose one Farah has the fewest voters of any seat in the state and that means this quarter of a million square kilometer electorate is set to grow even bigger if they leave broken hill in the electorate then the solution would be to actually increase the an enormous electric for any MP to cover considered likely absorbing towns on the edge of the snowy mountains for me it could mean that I'm effectively standing on the ridgeline of Matt kosciusko and looking at the queensland border that is a bit crazy one of just two females in cabinet she doesn't support quotas or targets but agrees her party must do more to lure rural women in particular to politics I think to myself we really want you so I'm going to talk to my female colleagues about putting a mentoring network in place amongst her early influences Bronwyn Bishop not an extravagant form of transport this little plane was built in nineteen seventy-nine the year I graduated from high and it can land on all sorts of little dirt out back strips flying frugally
Eastern side of very directly technical services here Preston as when working out for some time but some ideas to put before you the idea to my ears for you to have a look at what ideas p Scott and he's very interested to hear your response now if you have ideas that you believe may be missed by all means we want you to let let let the council know the whole idea tonight is to see if we can all work together and put up a program that's going to be a better fit in this build of drainage to that area in burien so don't be back with about that if you disagree with something let us disagree respectfully and we'll try and sort things out there's a fair bit to be done still there's a lot of money involved in this we're looking at something like six hundred and fifty thousand dollars so there's a fair bit of money involved and we want to get it right and the way we believe we can get it writing is you agree with them or are there some of edmonds you like your attitude so that any further ado I'll hand out of the Freddie and Tibet and they will lead a discussion on thank you thank you everybody coming as the moon had said I'm pretty external director technical services with why can everybody hear me good ole ole a terrific art Matt fire is my executive engineer and he's actually in charge of the design section of survey section of asset management so his boys have done the majority of the leg work in terms of sorting out the information will give you today all the decisions certainly have not been made as you'll see as we go through the presentation but initially we will go through the present which will sort of just but everybody knows sort of how the drainage system works in the town and then the work that we've done so far council identified drying tissues Easter you're all very strict if you go back to 2012 or we had drained these issues every week but they're and fifty thousand dollars which is in this year's budget probably regardless markets spec before the end of this financial year we would certainly have to be in a position to spend it in the following financial year my staff have looked at the issues and some solutions and will recommend some some works probably not tonight because I don't know that we've got enough information to actually recommend the final design of sorts of all where to do it will step through this process to where we're getting two for the recommendations so the various normal system and Alberto to be closer to that provide outstanding everybody right we've got a series of retention basins see then we become a modern honest when I just pointed to is at the back of the hospital and go for four-and-a-half megalitres there's another one in cotton street behind the water treatment works which is about three and a half and then we have 1 over in Jerome berry street which is up the top which is only a small one that's something that one about 3.5 so we get a rain everything sort of run into them and then to get it out of town we've only got two conversations basically didn't pump repair 60 liters a scene so I guess tratamos because we played up his very budgeted point system and we have an alternative to both of those pumps to fill the dams up at the golf course which we do when there's capacity up there unfortunately their dams large enough to to take the water all the time and it has to go out the Finley Road in the southern part of the town we have sort of this area we talking about here which is the Overland flow and finishes up down in the temp and we've got an open friday I did my carrier idea how to glue stick let's put over this fundamentals and that's just a picture old but I think the corporate street protection based probably a couple of pictures in there put through I slipped a little walk into robbery street that's the one at the back of way up for back at the hospital then there's much storage obviously up in the tank back already as well so there's a couple of pictures there from the tank paid this fri he is the one that goes at the Finley Road so that's one of our two outlets for the drainage so it's pretty limited what you can run and that's the one that goes out the other side the river road which is up in the LOL dry thanks so if you look at the water balance if you get 50 millimeters of rain over the area or varied in township you get about 50 milliliters of water there are in normal circumstances it's dry half of that the probably soaked into the ground the rest is either going to go into the storages and be pumped out now if your insights conditions and you're going to pump all of that out throughout it up close it take three a half days to clear after the two inches of rain so that's sort of the parameters that we're storage with the tank paddy give about 16 mega levels so yeah there's only about a third so anything that won't feeding them here in a stall is going to be gentle on the roads in the pipes up along the railway line wherever it could but it and if you go back to 2012 you will have all experienced that first here if you were here yeah best of drill restriction is currently no underground drainage Salford level move along where there is drainage it connects to data streets and all of your billing locals will know that the data street plugs on a regular basis that's the lowest point it's about 2,600 bhilwara then up at the school so when we get an excess of water everything connects back to their other than the drill destroyed corporatist root system the rest is all physically connected and that's why we get that in data stream the area that we're talking about has only got surface trains as I said earlier it all goes to the tank pad and is obviously if they've get a run so any of you to the living around there or children they had far more about that that I did the objectives from the money that counsel was put up basically to provide underground range to effectively drain the area help reduce the existing flooding in davis street and provide an outcall computer curb and gutter works to the east of jewelry stroke now obviously to achieve the best outcome for the available budget to Google that's proving to be quite a challenge so we've looked seriously at two options the first is the tank paddock option and that would require sort of reshaping the tech paid to provide an additional 10 mega liters of storage and installation of the pump station at Oxford Street for that plan of that so that basically is putting in a system on the ground point work where the pit boys up let's just covered by a radiator again into the tank pad with a pup station around here's a week so that's the first option we looked at and the second option is using the milliliters of storage with the pub station sort of office at the intersection of forcible street or Dennison stroke and again you can see the pot networks pop that difference now he goes down as far as foster everything but effectively that bald raise back to the pump station where the rectory and easily offering free so they're basically the two options that would look that next that puts relative costs still on any a hell of a battle trying to get either of them within 26 hundred and fifty thousand dollars and the current estimates are about eight hundred thousand we take the old Greg option at about 815 if we take on tank pet adoption and then obviously we need now to look at what options we have for reducing costs and one is to shorten the length of the line so we reduce the area that we're providing the underground drainage to until we've got additional funds to extend it and the second one is to reduce our pipe sizes which will then take longer for the water to drain away but it will that I need to put back to Council in terms of how we actually balance the budget once we decide which option we going cool as you can see from the costings there's not enough difference in the costumes of the two options to give us a clear cut idea which way we go and that's my reason why I'm talking to your people ok to see what the community feel is the best option I've had a few people say well we we don't want to want to hold office in school and we don't want to swap well I've just got a few players of some of the retention basins we've built so far this one's on the road into varuga opposite the new subdivision has passed trippy kids as you can see it doesn't hold water and it's not a bother this one that is in New to the mo but it's interesting we just in recent months going in order to the properties or people with living the properties around this one which is really grasped that whole area at Planet X or email about it very well and all sure the mayor will be a with you Muruga Muruga botanical does is again one of our stormwater retention basins and we have a very active community of management there that do a wonderful job had have developed it into work probably one of the best gardens in the region that one's in total all it's one that we've only just refurbished that was just a mud hole with the air some scrappy trees in it it's been reshaped and the watering system put in there so that's sort of up the back of which of course Riley caught this the one and you've probably all been to Finley and seen runaway part and it's not a very good photograph of it and the couch said buildings or garlic bread but again Rollo Park is one of our stormwater retention basins this is the work that we're just completely on what was the loko dam which used to be poor water let me out is also proposals at this stage to put a watering system in but that may happen in the future and this one's just a bit of an idea we didn't do something on the record maybe young might be useful to be able to create an end for other public purposes so as I said I don't have any particular preference for either building something on the old red ground or remodeling something of the tape back but we do need to provide another ten milliliters of storage suddenly don't believe the difference in the costumes by the time we finish is going to be that significant I guess the our trailer for over the questions and seek opinions from you

Well let's see how another one of these goes um we had council's meeting yesterday so there are a few things that happened and there are a few other things that will come up as a direct result of these minutes that I will discuss with you guys anyway so um the first thing that was decided was a local traffic committee was confirmed there's a festival of music to be held by the bdda in berrigan on friday the 26th of march so there's a road closure on chanter street for that event um then there's the anzac day parades in finley tucker mall and berrigan again there are some road closures to occur because of those so those were all approved the next one I'll just go down the suspension of alcohol-free zone in chanter street that's in relation to that music festival so that was also approved uh the token will go golf and bowls club why can't I say that togamall go golf and bowls club limited the mou with the berrigan shire council so a memorandum of token ball has been approved and um both the mayor and I will be signing that with their chair their um their chair and the ceo over there I'll have to get that organized in the next week or so um the murray river adventure trails so in my position on the board of the murray regional of murray regional tourism um there was a application that went in to the victorian tourism group tourism state group um and there's funding there for an an enabling tourism fund uh so the murray murray regional tourism board has put in an application there to complete a um adventure trail or so a walking and bicycle trail from all bree through to wentworth um the part that we would pay for was 3600 so that we could get the the detailed design work done for the section from beruga to cobra which is actually really good because three thousand six hundred dollars is probably a lot cheaper than it would normally be for us so um that would be really good and that will give us a link will be young persons policy was uh adopted as per a couple of changes to that I don't think there's anything major there um so just getting through there the motor vehicle policy which has been through the consultative committee was also was approved by them went to council and now council have also approved the new motor vehicle policy so that affects how we use council vehicles and how they are managed it is quite a fundamental change to the way we have managed cars in the past um but the consultative committee were happy with the changes there are quite a few outcomes to the workshop uh one of them was that we were to commence our rebranding project to investigate whether we should re rebrand the shire or not so you'll see that there is a survey out from keelan um so active I encourage you all to um put your feedback in there we'll start consultation with some community groups uh during march there will be will engage a creative agency by the end of march and hopefully the creative agency will be able or may this year so that'll be good um with the review of the tourism strategy council has asked that aviation tourism be included in the review of the tourism strategy because it appears that it is a newly developing market segment in our area um and directly related to the work that matt and karen henderson have done at the tocqueville aviation museum so good for them uh the next bit was the local environment plan and the getting a working group together so joe will start to look at how we develop that we advertise for the working group and work out who will be on it then there was another 14 14 proposals that council had asked us to consider and sorry I'm just trying to find those for you all so there's 14 outcomes and they include housing so they want us to look at how we might engage to provide some urgent affordable housing with the community what what are some creative ways we could do that counsellors have asked for consideration of how we succession plan for them um we are the the youth of the area have the opportunity to present to council and we understand then their their views for the future talking posts rather like my uh listening posts that were done when I first got here council laws would like to start those in each of the townships on a regular basis so we'll start to get a bit of a schedule ready for everyone um food share council can't currently contribute financially to that project so they're wondering if it's possible for a cool store to be put in finley somewhere so that we can have a broader reach with that particular project um multicultural events they've asked us to investigate if we could have at least one multicultural event in the shire annually they've asked for a business directory and calendar of events on our council website community group contacts as well if we could put those on our website the business awards they'd like staff to review the way the awards are delivered and presented and provide some value add for the winners they've asked us ideas there but that's still just floating around in my head so if you have any ideas please let me know the toy lab library there was apparently a toy library in the area that has defunct though we still have all of the well most of the toys so council has asked joe if she would investigate the possibility of the library service providing that service to the community from our own libraries um finley lake master plan council has acknowledged that they have no direct role in the development of the master plan and to this point I've only been providing the mechanism through which it can be developed however the community have approached our councillors and asked for more direct involvement in that process so we are just assessing they've asked the staff to assess how we might do that or how that is possible and they've asked for a public's art public arts strategy to be developed we have said that that probably won't be until 2023 2024 because we have a whole range of our strategic project policies and that was that was the corporate workshop was it was a really good workshop and for those managers who got to go um it was I think everyone got quite a lot out of it um so we will be trying to get more people more of the um the entire managers to go next time I think it was really quite valuable um they've endorsed our community strategic plan with very minor changes the reason we've put it in as we've got as is basically understanding that it's 10 years old we've got some statutory deadlines that we have to meet and the with the election being put up we couldn't review a community strategic plan in six months we couldn't do it effectively so what we have done is we've just adopted the one we really have at the moment and then in the first half of the next financial year we will do a complete review of the community strategic plan and I think that is a better approach and will provide us with a far better document the met with moira shire council it was our new south wales cross border commissioner that had some funding for cross-border communities it had to be of benefit to both communities what our council staff suggested was work on thompson's beach to finish off their master plan which will do things like provide all abilities access to thompson's beach do some trail work some signage all of those sorts of things our council has committed 65 000 to that project because they had to be co-funded both moira ourselves and the new south wales uh cross-border commissioner and we think that that is probably a really good step in the right direction there is a review of the councillor misconduct framework um out for response at the moment uh one of the things that they've asked and our submission uh council council has adopted our submission that matt hannon matt hansen oh I'll get this right one day matt hanson has um prepared and one of the things I am a little bit of actually I'm really a lot opposed to is that me as the to manage counsellor behavior um should a complaint be made and investigate uh complaints about counsellor's behavior but they're the people who decide how much I get paid or what my contract will look like so that would put me in a very awkward position and it's the same uh feeling of all the other gms and ceos the next one is the token wall preschool car park design so um the preschool have asked that we design their car park for them it will cost about four thousand dollars for us to do it in-house so we're doing that um we're not sure if they will then ask us to actually fund the project but until we've got the design we won't know how much it will cost so we can't ask council that part yet then there's mcallister street in finley council have agreed that we will go ahead with the tender that was presented we have three 350 000 already budgeted for in this year but because we the tender won't get to start until probably may't know we actually went out for two parts of macalester street rather than one part so we will be able to put the second half into next year's budget and that will work quite well uh next part I am taking leave from the 19th to the 22nd of april which is only four days but it does give me 10 days off over the easter weekend and my lovely son is coming to visit me so I'm a little bit excited because I have not seen him since january 2021 so I am quite excited about that and he'll be here with me and we'll be in melbourne and we'll be having a bit of fun um but I'll still be around because it's only four days uh so if anything urgent happens I'll still respond um counsellor's expenses and facilities policy was adopted well it was endorsed and it now is going out for public comment so it'll has to be out for 28 days so if you guys would like to read that you can make we manage counsellors how we pay them and what expenses they can claim back from council sorry getting through this very large policy because it's quite long it's 20 only a couple pages 20 something pages um nearly through the next part is an advocacy document now I'll send this out to everyone to read if you like when we get it done and that is about the federal election is coming up and council asked me to prepare a document that would help them to stay focused on our primary issues and to have some talking points so the same across all of them so we're doing this we'll make it into a brochure that they can leave with whoever comes through um in their bid for election in this federal election that's coming up because I think we've got about eight weeks to go um there was a development application that was put through for honourable drive and it was refused the shed was they have requested that the shed go in front of the house and it was refused under of late reports that we are going to the national general assembly so the australian local government association holds a national general assembly in canberra each june and we've been asked to I've been asked to get some uh motions ready that we can submit because elga this this uh conference then sets up how elga the australian local government association will advocate for the year it sets their agenda for the for the next year so will be quite important um and we will be we will we will have motions surrounding electricity and digital connectivity around um aerodromes and upgrading those facilities we will have there's another one around um skills existing skills and how we attract people here and how we make sure that the skills that we have are recognized and can be used as recognition of prior learning in the upgrade of skills um that we also we have a lot of work to do in the federal government's push for zero net emissions before 2050 and one of the things we think that should happen is that there is a councils who are doing the right thing and are trying to to meet their require those new requirements and then there's also obviously some work around housing and making sure that we have housing to support our key workers um not just councils but the entire communities obviously um and that the mayor and ceo will be attending the um the conference wow that was a lot of words um the next one is an engagement strategy with regards to town beach now I'm sure everyone has heard a thousand rumors about town beach I'm going to say it really clearly now we are not council is not trying to close downtown beach there have been significant changes though in the way that uh primitive camping is to be managed both and primarily that is legislatively um and and and there's obviously ways that we have to manage the environment and all of those sorts of things as well so we need to know what the community of token will so the people who live there who own businesses there or who work there so we want to know how they want to use town beach into the future because that will set council's direction as to what we spend our money on so the first part of the engagement strategy is just a very short um poll that uh keelan has sent out yesterday and I encourage you again if you're from tocomo please uh engage with that that survey because what we will do then is we will have a public meeting that considers the responses to the town beach matter and we will work from there with the community about how that option looks going forward we had quite a few notices questions without notice um one of the major issues that we are oh there's sorry there's some stuff around the visitor information center obviously there's some still some stuff around that happening in tober mall council is going ahead with a visitor information center in the new portal building we will be a accredited visitor center so we get a yellow eye which doesn't mean anything to a lot of people but it does mean that we can't have produce we can't sell things in that particular area it is a very small space for that reason it will only be providing information um so we are you will see that there is some advertisements for part-time positions going out for for us to get that going also we are working with uh the lbrca so the livestock carriers and our grain harvest people you will see a expression of interest go out really soon um to get people onto a freight network a freight working group so that we can implement a project called farmgate in berrigan shire what that will basically mean is that they the people who have freight uh big heavy vehicles will be allowed access to our entire network but under some strict um guidelines that will mean that they don't have to come to us for permits all the time which will save them a lot of time and it will also save gary george quite a bit of time I should think but it will also mean that with access to farmgate trucks need to days anyway and it's fairly easy to retrofit it and most of the freight uh carriers that we are talking to already have the telemetrics on board we will then be able to track where everyone goes and we don't know who it is we just know where these vehicles are going uh it doesn't have their number plates or anything like that on it's completely de-identified but that will mean that we will be able to see how our road network is actually used and start to plan out how we actually upgrade some of those roads to allow for high productivity vehicles because they're not going away they are only going to get bigger so we really do need to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support those businesses because they really can't leave this area we have so much you know food to get out to the rest of the world so it is really important that we do that work with them um so there was I'm just going through a few others that probably aren on tokemal for sure gosh there was so much happen um taken before sure I'm sure everyone heard that there was an incident on saturday that just went there is a police investigation that is currently underway surrounding that event so we can't really make any comment I don't know what actually happened there I wasn't there and I wasn't told of the incident um directly I found out fourth hand I believe when matt hansen called me to say that something had happened I was so I went over took some photos but the markets were already on so I don't really know much more than that to tell you but as we find out we will let you know we will however be looking at how we prevent the accidental running of cars into things like the um the water park because we were very lucky and no children were killed there was because it was quite early in the morning but it could have been quite catastrophic so we are going to look at how we prevent vehicles being able to stuff like that around those playground areas so that will be another piece of work for us to do the upstairs tenancy for the foreshore building um marin matt hansen and I all met with the preferred candidate the other day I think it was tuesday and he should have us a full business plan by the end of this week and then we will be able to assess whether we want to go further into some negotiations around leasing so it's getting quite close and we'll be able to let you know when we do know I have been appointed to the industrial advisory committee the new south wales industrial advisory committee and that is where we will start to look at your reward and how it works for rural councils so if you want to have anything that you want me to bring up at that committee meeting there is one in late march so please do please let me you know if there's something you would like to see changed in the award please please let me know um I'm also the ramjo shared services project for ramjo so there's that doesn't probably mean much 20th one but I will keep everyone up to date um I think that's it from council meeting I would like to say that bail has put his resignation in and he will finish up with us in april we are working on a design engineer replacement and should have an announcement about that fairly soon sanath and I hope that is how I say his name ready has been chosen as our grad engineer and he will also start in april so that's a good thing the it coordinator applications have closed and matt hansen is assessing those at the moment josh edwards has started as our it trainee he's 17 so please be gentle um and yes I think that that is it from me so if you have any questions about anything I just rattled through please please email me or call me or whatever and I'll try to answer them and please let me know what you think about these videos because I I'm happy to continue actually want alright then thanks

 we're Woodstock flower and we produce whole-grain stone-ground flour on our family farming very good news is the family farm has been an ends family for four generations and has been certified organic for 20 or so years and we have a small scale fire milling operation where we're producing flour for our local community and bakers in Melbourne mostly what we started this business as a way to attach ourselves to the family farm but you don't have to produce anymore so we just value adding what is already growing here are we added a few different varieties and things like that we are taking the produce and we're turning it into an end product that people can use in the house to bake beautiful baked goods or the Baker's can use the farm is about 2,000 acres managed by Ian's parents Bob and Jenny kundan and they've got sheep and cattle and we grow a variety of crops and so we've got some modern wheats and ancient corazon wheat spelt rye softer biscuit we yeah and we're also grains genebank just to try and experiment with new varieties that might be more flavorsome and suitable to the farm so we started the business two years ago we just started off with a small kitchen flour mill and we're selling flour at farmer's market so I'm in Melbourne mostly and then through the farmers markets we realized there was a massive demand for what we were doing and we weren't really able to make that to meet that demand with our small little kitchen milk so we decided to upgrade to a new American stone mill which is produced by a couple in Vermont in the States and it produces a really lovely fine stone-ground flour which means it's full of flavor and can perform really well in sourdough breads in particular we're part of a growing movement of bakers and farmers Millers academics plant breeders who are working towards building a local green economy where grain is no longer treated like a commodity but where grain is valued for its regional diversity and kind of celebrated in the same way that we as a model that could be replicated on other farms or just as as an example of what you can do with grains in all their diversity and how farmers can better connect with consumers and and the community so Woodcock flower allows us to come back to the family farm run a sustainable business and also contribute to Mum and dad's business and being an extra set of hands and set of heads that can think about and increase the production and regenerative capacity of luscom so yeah we're really proud of what we're it's come and looking forward to a where to go in the future
Locomotion swim Academy is a home-based Swim School in the Bergen Shire we conduct swimming lessons from our heated mineral pool in Baraga Atlas coaches at the outdoor pool at token wilds through the summer months and then the indoor heated pool at Muruga through the winter months I'm assuming instructor qualified to teach infants through to adults master swimmers and swimmers with disability I'm also a licensed coach with the National Coaching accreditation scheme I coached swimmers from a variety of clubs within the district offering coaching sessions outside of their own training programs I've always been passionate about swimming I was a competitor myself and I've represented Australia in Taekwondo where I gained valuable knowledge that I use with my swimmers today we live on the Murray River these irrigation channels dams on farms and creeks water safety for kids is really important Liz was trotting around the Shire teaching children that couldn't swim in a chlorinated pool swimming lessons and spending more time in the car than what she was actually spending in the pool and the logical solution was to actually and start teaching from home so that's where we are today we offer classes from infants right through to the competitive swimmer for example we've got the parent and infant classes we introduce water familiarization with the use of songs and games to develop aquatic skills we also offer early development classes developing the confidence in the water with activities skills and games and then we've got the stroke development where we refine basic fundamentals with the use of skills and drills to improve stroke efficiency we ensure that all of our students learn correct technique this is really important because it translates them to more effective and efficient movement through the water which leads to a more confident and competent swimming my approach to coaching is race specific high-intensity training designed to achieve optimal performance this equates to efficiency in the water and results in race specific adaptation we're the parents of two children swimming lessons in our household were not negotiable because swimming is a life skill there was 249 drownings in Australia last year 67 Sena those were in swimming pools and where risk our mission is to be a part of the solution to that problem I've been a paramedic for 30 years and Liz will save more lives teaching swimming lessons and preventing drownings than I ever will as a paramedic and that's why what we do as straight worker motion is so important
If it came backyard vegetable grower and I like stronger a bit of fruit but over the last year or so I've noticed fruit fly my project unfortunately fruit for Queensland fruit fly is becoming more of an increasing problem especially over the last few years they do like stone tree and peaches nectarines oh they're really hiding their priority list the jaws are usually very attractive you'll see a spongy spot on the side of the lemon maybe with a bit of gel juice coming from that spot or a little white maggot these are female attractant traps so well for male bias traps they have a protein component inside which is you tract into the female flies okay like a food source that's right better see the end result there it's quite a few pause there's a few blowflies in the net but mostly young fruit faust they're attracted to the yellow color and the smell of that protein in inside the trap they come in come through the holes there's a hole in the bottom there I was up in and dream in that solution there is a killing stripping this one that helps kill the fly yep because they the gel itself draws after that kind of a bit of a crusty layer in there in the bottom of the track it's still attractive to the to the fruit point and that killing the strip just helps kill any fly as it come in so little contact insecticide it'll do a lot soft fruit yeah there so your nectarines peaches apricots oh love like it's at this time of year yeah screw the lid on and hang it in the tree a shady part of the tree inside the tree where the fruit flow is going to be you know attracted to and the suppose once a week or once a fortnight I'd have to change that solution and I tipped that down the sink and wash away so I wouldn't leave traces of the solution somewhere else would attract flies wouldn't catch them in a trap you would idea so would you expect to trap like a bio trap of ceará to last throughout season it would the Bible asked me at three to four months for both of them and the fly like us don't really want to be in the Sun in the hottest part of the day so I go into the tree somewhere where it's cooler a bit more humidity in the show it's a and touch won't dry out as much
Just welcome everyone I will introduce myself because some may not know who I'm council john bruce filling in for the mayor counts the curtain who's an apology burn is not well tonight also we have an

of the meeting is to discuss the current reform of local government which the state government has embarked on to process has been going on for some three years or more now we have to make a response to thank owned by the 18th of ticking one of those boxes from the state government point of view where we called another public meeting to allow the community to be informed of this night is really information night we will make a presentation and then we'll open up to discussion but we are taking box earlier on we went to round all the towns and had a public meeting informed the public in the four towns what process was happening that's about six months ago and now I suppose it was when we do at some time ago but we have seen but this is just to follow up the final opportunity for the community to have a say so I won't go into any more detail what I'll allow is Ryan to make a presentation rather and Pete ourselves and then we can open it up for some discussion questions or and we certainly want to hear your comments so I'll hand over to run thanks John welcome everyone and thanks for coming Suzy is forming part of tonight's presentation to put on our websites you won't be will make so you don't need to worry about that when you're asking any question as councillor Bruce has suggested the purpose tonight's meeting is really to inform the community the council view in relation to the stage for proposed merger program for new south wales and at the end I'll tell you what their position is to date and then we can talk about that but just a quick summary of how we how we got to where we are and many of you will have seen stuff in the media or in your license out doing public meeting street stalls etc but this all started in 2011 was basically a program developed by the office of local government and local now local government New South Wales which their industry peak body where they saw a need to modernize local government for the next 25 years if it was to continue to serve its communities counselor and magoo you went and I went to that of Dubbo as did a the mayor and general manager at basically every council in New South Wales now that things that needed to be done whether they were statutes or where there was just how councils operated or how about the relationship between the state and the council's but not far into the price this local government New South Wales actually handed that process over the state and asked them to conduct a review of local government in New South Wales which probably my humble opinion might not have been the best thing to do but anyway that's what they did and the state responded by pointing what was known as an independent local government review panel to review local government in New South Wales and to report back to the government now that panel did that and came up with about 70 recommendations across a whole range of issues about 70 recommendations as I said now one of those recommendations about structural reform of council so merges and things like that now to this point the state has primarily focused on that one recommendation and is progressing some of the others but that's burners primary focus now what they want to achieve a tour that statements but in in relation to barragan shire council it the panel recommended that it merged with jewelry Shire Council or that drilled rashad Council become a rural Council now the only going to great deal of detail about of water rural Council is but a rural Council is basically a normal Council of delegate some of its functions to another organization to undertake on its behalf now there was a range of if you're like incentive packages provided at that time the key parts of that were run to councils merged there was a five-million-dollar carrot and in some access system low-cost borrowings following that position that the state had put forward barragan like all councils had to either demonstrate to the state that it was fit for the future as a calls it or merge with its recommended partner and be deemed to be fit for the future so even if you weren't you were deemed to be and had access to the incentive packages so the the council said about preparing a business case and it also prepared a an independent business case in conjunction found that barragan was sustainable and that was supported by meeting the state's seven criteria seven criteria and in reality council felt was better off to stand alone now having done that the council considered those reviews both internal and external and resolved that it was effectively better off to stand alone so prepared a case around that presented it to I part the independent pricing and real regulatory tribunal was appointed by the state to review the council submissions in relation to their fitness for the future or their merger proposal so the council submitted its case as I stated earlier I part reviewed those submissions by all councils and I guess two things have emerged from that one was that the government was disappointed I think that it only got a very low level of number of councils who were wanting to merge and in the case of barragan it was deemed to be unfit for the future not because it was not financially sustainable because it didn't believe they had the strategic capacity to be a credible partner of the state the the benefits the merger if you like three things and not necessarily in any order but a downward pressure on rates maintain an improvement in the ability to maintain improving infrastructure and the ability to maintain and improve service delivery delivery now in my counsels opinion that proposed merger doesn't achieve any of those outcomes we believe that it would in fact creator council with an underlying deficit position and if savings are to be achieved through the service through through their merger that will be from services gravitating to the lowest level and that was what was highlighted in the independent report we had prepared and again you can disagree with us but we don't see that there's any would be any improvement in the strategic capacity of the new council additionally we see that long-term financial strain will start pretty well straight away due to the government has some restrictions around what councils can do when they merge and also industrial awards have some restrictions on what can be done but the the reality is that or the key parties that the state because it doesn't want of a rural community protects and that this is a matter of a pending half hour guys but protects the staff positions in any town where the councillors located with a population of less than 5,000 people you know now that case of our process both barragan township and jewelry Township speak up right now the state is now now that the ipod assessment has been released given the council another 30 days to reconsider its its position which in our case was to stand alone obviously same time it's also sweetened the amalgamation package if you like where it'll now has now prepared to provide if all the parties agree so that's the merging councils and the state agree they'll give you five million dollars to assist with the cost of the merger and they'll give you five million dollars for community infrastructure now community infrastructure is in its broadest sense but it's really capital works as opposed to operational subsidies the Council believes that that change support package doesn't really do anything much to underlie the the concern that it has _''_606.779 operational subsidy doesn't do anything to address the underlying deficit position and if it did it would be short-lived in any case now having identified that concern the council's met with the minister and Adrian Piccoli and tried to explain to them that whilst not int and emerge a per se it counts cannot support a merger proposal that leaves us residents in the state possibly in a worse state than they are now and is possibly unsustainable so what what the council really saying is that if if it doesn't believe that this is a good position for the residence of the shower it's not going to do anything that imposes it on the community the minister can if he likes but your councils not going to do that if so that so the council's position now is to continue to try and stand alone as it believes in the present circumstances that's in the best interests of the residents following on from that at also believes that if there can be something done to make the new merge council sustainable from day jewellery doesn't have a problem with that now we are operating in a bit of a vacuum because the government won't tell the council's what happens after we've lodged their submission which identifies your preferred future and there's plenty of opinions about whether they're sup their incentives will still be available or not available anyway the bottom line is we don't don't know so the council's final point to make is that if it is the peers to be or is going to be forced to undertake a merger it will do what it can to take the best option to try and one secure what it what incentive funds are available and whatever else it might be able to achieve to address its its concerns now the council has got to commit to its final position which as I said at the moment is to stand alone continue to try and stand alone it's got to commit to that by the I tainted November so that's a week away from today and that's the purpose of the with the council's position or you're not and have some discussion about a clarifier whatever concerns you might have and jewellery you don't mind me telling them what your position is jority have had a meeting today and their position is too far one is to try and continue to stand as a rural council or a four-way merger with barragan Cora or you're an RN and geraldi it doesn't support a merger with barragan so I guess the purpose of tonight is to firstly answer any questions you've got and then see if the council's on the right track according to what you think or whether you think something else should be happening
Happy thursday beautiful people uh we are blue sherlock welcome to love local live this is series 2 because the first one went so good the blue man city council is like we're going to present another

Okay I might make a start um if anybody else comes into the room um okay so we were going to have a couple of our um our aquatic um uh our aquatic officer and our and our environmental education officer I come into a bit of a talk on how you can be a citizen science and what things you can do in the in your own backyard to I guess encourage and also assist encourage wildlife into your yard and assist any of the programs that we have to protect our wildlife and flora and our flora and fauna and pretty much the entire environment um so how can you become a citizen science citizen scientist um you can get out into the nature so there's been a growing interest in opportunities for people to get out and become involved in citizen science over the past few years um there's many reasons to do it uh it is getting out into nature and enjoying the sunshine and after lockdown it I'm sure there's plenty of people that have uh are enjoying getting out and past few months you can learn about things in your backyard as tracy said keep an eye on your locals know who's around and and what uh animals that you do have in your environment that you may be able to assist in in maintaining population sizes and also you can you can add habitat for them knowing what you've got there the the collection of the data that you can you can collect through various platforms which I'll show you shortly uh it can also contribute quite widely to research and and allowing those in the areas of conservation to understand exactly what populations are still around after the 2019 fires there was quite a few populations of various wildlife and and vegetation communities that have been impacted so it's been a good opportunity to get people involved but also have a wider spread across a large area to to get that data to be able to contribute to the research um and it's it's fun I mean I'm a wildlife ecologist as I said in a previous life that was what and and having a bit of a bash around in the bush to see what's what's out there um there's a lot in our backyard that we do take for granted and it's good to get out there and see what we can what we can um find and of course my phones just run it never rings they pull back um so the platforms as I said we've got a few platforms that are available eye naturalist seems to be the one that everyone is using at the moment um I am actually an I naturalist citizen scientist myself I have a profile on that so the way that this works is you find your organism you take a photo of it you can share it with people and it then links into the databases that will allow you to identify the areas where things have been located okay sorry for that um okay so and you also can contribute to the the atlas of uh living australia which um is developed I think through the museum of australia oh yeah australian museum um is our aquatics aquatic officer she was going to be doing the presentation but unfortunately she was pulled aside she had other commitments that were came up so get your photos in sharp focus and this gives you a good opportunity to be able to have this identified and the eye naturalist program is also another um really good place to um identify in organisms yourself uh there'll be a lot of photos on there that you can then have a look at and you can and try and decide whether or not that's exactly what it is and because you're working with other people and quite a few very experienced people with within the flora and fauna identification areas they'll be able to give you a positive identification as to what it is that that you've actually um located include multiple angles if it's a flowering plant or I mean gum trees are often very difficult to identify the the capsules and things of of gum trees are very hard to get hold of but if a leaf or a flower of a that you may be able to capture with with animals also you know close-ups colors of their fur length of tail and things like that are all really good ways of being able to identify um what it is that you've actually what you've actually found so if you can capture these without touching the animals obviously we don't want to be going and capturing animals and taking photographs to get good shots we just want to leave them in their natural environment so with birds often the coloring of their feather and and the time of the year also can indicate as to whether or not it's a male or a female in breeding plumage or otherwise so once you've taken all of these you can upload them into the inaturalist platform which is available online you can find it at inaturalist.org I think it is the the details are in the in the end of the presentation and there are a few projects that you can actually get involved in so the environment recovery project is one that is being run um after and and monitor the the recovery stages of uh of the environment and and what is flowering and what isn't um present anymore within these areas that were severely burnt and and very um badly damaged um another thing with the photography you can actually geo tag it so that it will show exactly where you are located within your or area or you can put it under a ga privacy so if you're taking photographs from your backyard for instance that you don't want necessarily to be um publicized across the entire the entire platform uh it gives you a bit of privacy there it can give you an area within you know a suburb sort of thing so that it is still relevant for the data collection um one of the projects that alice is currently running at the moment is the crayfish in the blue mountains count so I will run up through a youtube clip here that she's provided which gives you a bit of an indication of what the program is all about and how you can get involved and I beautiful brightly colored crayfish in our blue mountain streams but few people know how long-lived they are or how important they are for the health of the streams people see the crayfish in our streams and call them yabbies yabbies actually refers to a different species and is actually invasive in the blue mountains the two species that are native are what's called spiny crayfish so especially on the claw you'll see some spines on the native species a yabby is totally smooth they're different to yabbies because they grow much more slowly and live for much longer and only one in a thousand will will survive until maturity in the blue mountains crayfish are threatened in a number of ways first up we have storm water storm water carries pollutants so anything that's on the ground in the urban areas will be picked up and washed into the creeks with storm water pesticides are a particular danger as we saw at jamison creek in 2012 when at least a thousand giant spiny crayfish were killed overnight we quite often find illegal traps that people any kind of fixed track is illegal in the blue mountains platypus turtles lizards snakes water rats all of these amazing native animals can be killed by people putting traps into the water in an attempt to catch crayfish crayfish can be found in pretty much every creek and stream in the blue mountains that has flowing water in it each year the females they release young into the creek and it's these young which are the food source for the whole creek for everything in the catchment for the whole year these crayfish are a lobster size and in the old days people used to eat them but really these days there's no reason for someone to take out an animal that's been there for 30 years in that creek this is an animal that you can take your children down to see and their children can come down and see the same animal in that creek in that spot people see a dead crayfish they should report it if they see a live crayfish they should report it and bottom line just don't help the crayfish and get involved with blue mountain's crayfish count please leave crayfish in their creeks it's the best place for them if you'd like to help us help crayfish get involved in the blue mountains crayfish count okay so as you can see there that that's just one of the uh programs or the projects that are running on the I naturalist there's other citizen science platforms that you can use um frog id is a really good one that's developed by um australian museum and that's also got a lot of um all sort of voice or frog call um identifications on there because obviously you can quite often hear the frog but you can't see the frog so it will also help you identify um exactly what sort of frogs that are it is that you have in your um in environment or what you have around in your backyard one of the most common ones we get in in the blue mountains is probably the parents tree frog um that one can be heard and seen they tend to be um out there and about but there are plenty of other species of frogs uh in the blue mountains and and surrounding areas and that's a really good one to be able to um identify what it is that you're looking at but you can also keep your own records of what you've found around um the national water bug blitz this one I haven't had a great deal to do with so okay so the national water water bug blitz is a nationwide waterway monitoring event each year it calls people to become citizen scientists and investigate how healthy their waterways are and the wetlands that are around them by exploring what sort of water bugs you have in the area um even a local or a home pond will have water bugs I've got quite a few in mine and I like to sit overnight and watch them um in the in the light through the water um to to see what's available in there and that's a really good sign of a healthy waterway um we notice if I'm not able to actually answer them um in the resources section which I've got um coming up there there is a lot of other projects that are available um to participate in as part of an um citizen scientist there are other organizations uh bird life australia has um well twitter sort of counts and bird counts birds in backyards they have quite a few different activities that we can become involved in to help monitor the the populations and the existences of different species within our um within our backyards basically it's a good way to also I guess tie all of what we've done today into that the volunteering side of things as I think it was um liz from the the red cross said a lot of the the presenters and people that are involved in this uh resilience building and preparedness sort of things whether it be preparing the environment or preparing ourselves and our communities in other areas we are volunteers and it's a good way to network and and that also assists with our mental well-being the company of others that have similar um similar I guess activities and interests so um if there's any questions I'll stop sharing this now um but yeah feel free to put any questions into the chat box and I will do my best to answer them um if there's anything that I can't answer I will take it on notice and give that to our environmental education and aquatics officer for advice no questions okey-dokey then well um I will see all of you in the next session for the resources I'll give you a bit of a run through what it is that we're working on at the moment in terms of resources and how we can provide that one stop shop access to critical information that that we need and where the best places are to find that information so I will meet you across in the next session thank you very much
The true history of the gully yeah is this very untold story there was the the whites and the blacks that lived here they were all battlers and they all got on pretty well together I suppose because the race track hurt them so much and their families that some people never came back but they never stopped having their connection back into the gully this is what this is all about it's about getting the community wanting to tell the true story of the place and actually opening people's eyes to to the values that are in these areas for our people the gandungra people it was a summer camp so we would come up here in summer and go back down to the varagran in winter what's here is springs and you never run out of water and it's really fresh water water was just a key element and an attraction to not just the aboriginal community but the broader community they always talked about the sweet water because of the swamps you have the right environment for the food sources so you fletcher's my name and I was only born up the hill there at the old slaughter yard my mother was born down here in the gully I lived here in the gully before the catalina lake went in it never done no arm to the people who was living here that was the race track that done all the damage in 1957 the council approved the construction of the catalina racetrack and that resulted in the eviction of the aboriginal people from the site but it also caused significant environmental damage when they bulldozed the racetracks through the bushland and through the swamps in the process they also bulldozed the settlement that occurred in this area my name's david king I live up in the blue mountains mum was born up in kitumba in the gully we called gagari and in the mid-1990s one of my uncles passed away they then told us were aboriginal and they told us we're gandungra after finding out I was aboriginal I then found out about the gully story and then I found out about my mum about where she was is a connection and it's a very strong connection it's very important especially as I learned all about the gully people as I learnt the stories started to read the books found out about its history it just became a bit of a special place in my life there was significant damage to the social fabric of the aboriginal community that was here and families were uprooted that had lived in the gully for generations but there was also significant damage to the bush land and gargery swamp care started to try and reverse that environmental damage and try and restore the swamps in the gully back to their pre-catalina racetrack condition so our first goal when we sat down and thought okay where do we start there's a lot of weeds there's a lot of bits and pieces we could do here they always talked about the water down here always being sweet and fresh basically thought we'd start with the swamps there's a couple of swamps that are very degraded because there's a couple of drainage lines being put in so it's sort of now running a bit more like a creek than a swamp we remove some willows and what we're trying to do is reuse the willows then to create the swamp so it comes back into its natural form having the gallegry swamp care group really made a huge impact in 12 months it's like we're bringing the swamp back to life when we first got onto the site it was very very degraded and there was like well we're going to be here for quite a few decades and then with that little bit of funding that we did get to all the use of the contractors it was just brilliant to be able to get a a good gap in the actual weeds and then I think it sort of spurned everybody else on the swamp care group is a fantastic group partly because it's under david king's leadership he's created a real community family atmosphere around the landcare group so there's lots of kids get in touch with nature through the process we always have stories being told bringing the gully community in a sense back through this sort of swamp care is bringing a lot of connections that might not have happened if we hadn't got down here and started doing some of this work there was no electricity down here even in my time but I know they've got it we've all come together again and we're all so pleased that on what's going on here now I always feel like today just coming here it's a place I want to come to I've been doing bush care for quite a while now I think it's very fun I like getting muddy as well so as you might be able to see I've got a bit of mud on me um yeah it's kind of fun around here to me this project isn't just about reinvigorating the environment and caring for the swamp it's about caring for people and giving people the connection to country and we enable them to pass on that connection to their grandchildren and great grandchildren and involved in caring for environment and country we're we're just continuing what our ancestors did look after our land so it's about the people from the gully literally being the people who have a voice in the gully our people can actually make proper decisions on what it is with blue mountain city council council has a co-management agreement with the gully traditional owners so that any decisions that are made in the management of this place are made in consultation with the gully traditional owners because the end of the day it is public land and everyone has the right to come here and enjoy what we're enjoying today it's been a happy place and a sad place at times so we're hoping that the sad times have gone completely and everyone will be making new memories here well one thing I'd like to say is to for people when they come to the gully in the future or now in the future respect us respect the gully as aboriginal place you
Okay okay we'll just wait a few moments to let everybody into the room as we've said before all of these sessions are recorded so if you need to come back and look at them again later on you'll get your links through to be able to do that okay we might get started uh if people want to catch up if they've missed out um in the early start parts of the session they can catch up later on so um I'd like to introduce you to philip zen from uh habitat for humanity um habitat for humanity have been working in the blue mountains assisting with some of the recovery efforts across the region um the lithgow hawkesbury and blue mountains areas so philip will give us a bit of a chat today about things that we can do to build networking and just assist uh with our general individual and family uh preparedness so thank you very much for being here phillip thank you back and thanks everyone for joining us so yeah I'm going to give you a quick overview bushfire preparation and just to start with um this is a wombat um so one batch it's been said allow other animals in their burrows during a bushfire um wombats barrows are quite pushed by resilience they're able to survive the bushfires which other animals can't and they've actually you know allowed other animals to get inside the borough and shelter from bushfire the the reports about wombats rounding up other animals and allowing them to enter the boroughs are not really true but it just makes you think that when people want to to work together they can actually be stronger together and that's kind of the aim of the project that I'm going to introduce today just a bit about habitat for humanity um we're an international non-governmental organization uh international charity um and since 1976 when we were established in the usa we've probably helped about 35 million people around the world to construct or rehabilitate or protect their homes from disasters and theoretically if you consider habitat as a building organization it's the largest non-profit building organization from office in sydney and we work especially with fiji cambodia vietnam bangladesh and nepal and our vision uh which is here is a world where everyone has a safe and decent place to live whether in nepal or new south wales our mission is to build strength stability and self-reliance through shelter through housing through homes I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the programs in australia and we have quite a lot going on in new south wales in particular over the last few years since we've been active in new south wales and australia in general we've helped people build about 220 homes people who wouldn't otherwise have the means to to build their own homes we have a program called brush with kindness whereby volunteers help to fix up and decorate um people's homes to a disadvantage or especially um domestic violence shelters for people who've experienced domestic violence and um you may have heard that over the last few years we've been quite active in the blue mountains and other areas on bushfire recovery actually saturday fires in victoria and last year alone around 2020 we assisted 213 property owners and about 1 000 volunteers got involved in our bushfire recovery work what I'm going to talk about in more length is a new program that's starting out now which is about bushfire resilience so having worked on bush by recovery in blue mountains and other areas over the last year and a half since the 2019 to 2020 fires there's more yet to do so first of all I'm just going to explain a little bit about the scope of the project what we're trying to do and how others can get involved and the whole idea of habitat for humanity the whole way that we work our model is through volunteers it's through people who give up a bit of their time and give up a bit of their expertise to help others this new project is going to take place in the greater blue mountains area and by that I mean the blue mountains local government area um but also the lithgow and hawkesbury local parallel project going on in the southern highlands by which I mean one dilly and winter caribbean local government areas so first of all resilience why why are we doing a project about bushfire resilience basically anybody anyone who's tried to prepare their property for bus fires and other disasters you may know it's actually really really hard work you can be out there in the sun clearing vegetation by hand you can be out there in the cold or wet you can have you may have to climb ladders you may have to haul heavy items around and not everyone is actually able to do that think about uh you know your neighbors or people in the community who may be elderly um people with disabilities um people with low incomes you may not be able to afford the equipment and certainly can't afford to hire people to come and do the work for them but even if you're not able to prepare your property you still deserve a bit of help and support to get that done and that's why we're starting property by themselves but working in team with other people you can so what are we trying to do first of all we're trying to build the community resilience to bushfires by reducing the risk in individual households and properties when we say reduce risk we have to acknowledge we can't completely eliminate the risk um if there are catastrophic fires then the damage may be done but we can certainly help households to reduce the amount of hazard they're exposed to by doing things that the other speakers have talked about by helping people to clear gutters clear vegetation cut overhanging branches help people write an emergency plan and so on and so forth and very much the project that we're starting up here in the blue mountains will be kind of a compliment to the ada program that was mentioned by the rural fire service we're going to target people who are otherwise unable to actually prepare their own properties um again the elderly people with disabilities and so on um and get working bees going with volunteers the volunteers will come along to be done a team will come along fully insured and briefed up and led by a supervisor who is a qualified tradesperson with the appropriate work health and safety qualifications and many heart many hands will make like work um the team of volunteers will be able to get a lot more done in one or two days than many individuals could in a week or two um and that's you know basically how it's going to work we have a plan to do a lot of households through this scheme of households that we assess to be eligible for us to work with the other side of the project is much more about community as well as individual households it's about building the capability and the connection within people's communities by community I could mean you know not just a whole village or a township it may be a neighborhood or a street that's on the bush and you know again working together local people can help their neighbors and local people who live in those exposed areas um and and actually so again this side of the project kind of complements existing groups and activities that are going on I know for example that around black heath and victoria there's a program called huff the heads up the fire program and you know similarly the habitat for the humanity project is going to help different communities get together um if they haven't already done so and we'll provide trainings for example you know how to use a chainsaw how to identify the white kind of vegetation uh there'll be workshops for people to share knowledge and there'll be systems for the planning for bushfires guidelines and so forth and communications um facilities that will help to install such as notice boards and communication trees so that people can actually help each other understand what's going on at any one time so basically this will be about helping different communities who who want to take part in the program just put together about more formal infrastructure so that in the event of emergency they've got everything they need and they're able to help each this part of the project we'll be assisting some households with preparing their individual emergency plans um now a number of us in the blue mountains you know in the rfs in the council have just completed a training and if you consider you know people with disabilities um particularly elderly people or people with mental health etc problems making a plan can be much more complex than it might be for others for example you'd have to consider you know what would you do about your medications if you have a wheelchair how would you actually evacuate with a wheelchair and all of the things that are needed to run a wheelchair in the long term what about assistance animals what about guide dogs and so forth so there's lots more complications that some people experience and uh we will be assisting a number of people to to build an emergency plan so that all of those things are taken into account okay so just again to reiterate you know we will be you know working with these neighborhoods um over the course of the next building guidelines and communication systems and so forth so I just want to emphasize that the whole idea the project we're implementing is about local people helping local people what habitats that humanity has done in the past and continue to do so has been very much about having volunteers drawn from from anywhere um you know for example we have volunteers who are based in in sydney um who will come out of the blue mountains or go down to the southern highlands and help out but we really really want to build up um the the database of local people who want to get involved in this and help out in the local area so you know later on in the presentation I will give you some details for how you can actually get involved and and how you might be able to help your neighbours who need further support in bushfire preparation when does it start it's starting now um we did want to begin the projects quite a bit earlier but we were unfortunately very much delayed due to covid um because the activities others working in teams um even though it's outside we just couldn't do anything during the recent lockdown but now that is more or less over uh we can actually begin so the activities that we want to do the households that we um will offer some support to we really would like to get started from november from next month or even next week and they'll continue until around march 2023 or possibly longer um who's bank well this this is actually a government funded project and they've actually asked habitat for humanity to to carry it out since we have the expertise in volunteering um so it's it's under the the fund that's called the bushfire community recovery and resilience fund um and that's that's contributed by both the commonwealth and the state's governments and specifically that's the national recovery and resilience agency and resilience new south wales so though habitat the humanity is actually implementing the project we're a non-governmental organization we're a charity it's government money that's uh that's for example that money has gone towards a van um that will soon be coming up to the mountains we'll have all the equipment necessary for preparing the household yeah we'll have the chainsaws we'll have the the tools we'll have the drills we'll have the hose space and all those things that volunteers need to actually get to somebody's house and clear it up sufficiently to prepare it for a bushfire situation so that's nearly all um I've done this presentation quite quickly but I certainly invite some people who are watching to to send me any questions or to um to join in the chat right now there's a couple of ways you can actually learn more online we're just about to upgrade our website so bear with us for a few weeks but you can still read more at habitat.org au strike bushfire program and that will be updated very soon anybody who really would like to volunteer and join us directly you can go to this url have it out nsw.rostify.com.edu you can fill in your activities come up in the blue mountains and elsewhere you'll be sent an email alert and you can you can elect to to join in and meet up with other like-minded people who want to help out the bushfire recovery and bushfire resilience work and on that website will also be put through a workout work health and safety induction and just make sure that everyone is on the same page when they come to the site lastly you can look at our social media you know look out for habitat for humanity australia and we're on facebook instagram and so on and so forth and last but not least you can contact me on my email pcent habitat dot org dot a u should you wish um and that's all for now just emphasize that those contact details a bit more please do send any questions if you have them with the chat thanks very much for that phillip um obviously if anybody uh doesn't get to write those down or can't get in touch with philip for whatever reason uh feel free to mountains um and we can get you in touch with philip um it's a really good program that I see um doing well within the mountains it's it's like the networking side of things is really good and it'll be good to see something um to be able to get the volunteers back out into the into the workplace and and out together with that networking after covert so um thank you very much is there any questions linda has said that it sounds like an excellent program um is there any questions from anybody in the audience out there that would like to ask a phillip before we head on to the next session looks like you've covered it all perfectly well um obviously this is all recorded again uh you can watch it again afterwards and you will be able to get philips details there um it looks like it's a good program and and we're looking forward to um assisting where we can as council within within your program there too philip so we'll be in touch I'm again to people who are listening in on zoom look out on social media and uh we'll be publicizing this a little bit more as things get going we'll definitely need a lot of volunteers who are willing and able to help out and we're also going to be looking out for people in households who would like a bit of support as well so yeah just let us know um this is a new program it's just starting up and you know there's going to be a lot to do I have no doubt thanks again for coming along phillip and we will also promote once you've got anything organized and up and running properly we'll um assist promoting that through our blue mountains communications channels as well through council so uh look out for those out in the community um thank you very much for coming and um yes we will see everyone into the next uh session which is uh from tracy um burgess from blue mountains wires she's going to give us a little bit of a rundown or what we can do in in areas of of the bush to help establish some good connections with our wildlife there is a few minutes between now and then if people would like to take a break and go and grab a coffee or something feel free to do that that will start at quarter to three thanks very much and thanks again phillip
 many people love to see the beautiful brightly colored crayfish in our blue mountain streams but few people know how long-lived they are or how important they are for the health of the streams people see the crayfish in our streams and call them yabbies yabbies actually refers to a different species and is actually invasive in the blue mountains the two species that are native are what's called spiny crayfish so especially on the claw you'll see some spines on the native species a yabby is totally smooth they're different to yabbies because they grow much more slowly and live for much longer and only one in a thousand will will survive until maturity in the blue mountains crayfish are threatened in a number of ways first up we have storm water storm water carries pollutants so anything that's on the ground in the urban areas will be picked up and washed into the creeks with storm water pesticides are a particular danger as we saw at jamison creek in 2012 when at least a thousand giant spiny crayfish were killed overnight we quite waterways to try and catch crayfish any kind of fixed track is illegal in the blue mountains platypus turtles lizards snakes water rats all of these amazing native animals can be killed by people putting traps into the water in an attempt to catch crayfish crayfish can be found in pretty much every creek and stream in the blue mountains that has flowing water in it each year the females they uh release young into the creek and it's these young which are the food source for the whole creek for everything in the catchment for the whole year these crayfish are a lobster size and in the old days people used to eat them but really these days there's no reason for someone to take out an animal that's been there for 30 years in that creek this is an animal that you can take your children down to sea and their children can come down and see the same animal in that creek in that spot people see a dead crayfish they should report it if they see a live crayfish they should report out of our creeks help us to help the crayfish and get involved with blue mountain's crayfish count please leave crayfish in their creeks it's the best place for them if you'd like to help us help crayfish get involved in the blue mountains crayfish count
All right so I'll just wait a few moments to let everyone into the room yep you're done well vic not long now she's uh what the experience okay they're all coming in just give a few more seconds to allow everyone in running a little bit behind time but that's okay yep okay well we might get started so today um we have greg worth and megan watson so megan is one of our um step-by-step well-being counsellors uh step by step is our recovery support organization at the moment working on the ground with um flood and bushfire impacted communities across lithgow hawkesbury and the blue mountains and greg is a mental health clinician with new south wales health and he's also working in the um space of bushfire covert and flood recovery so I will put it across to you megan and greg if there's any questions again as previously put it into the q a box and we'll have a look at it through the session or get to it at the end of the session thank thank you thanks thanks bet thanks for the introduction and and thank you for putting on the the expo and to the council as well for uh you know having the having the get ready expo uh available people available to people uh yeah hi my name's greg worth I'm a bushfire slash disaster recovery clinician working for the mountains local health district uh the roles were formed after the 2019 fires and uh have been extended uh until 2023 um as governments take a bit big longer-term um sort of view of recovery um working as beck said working in the community with the individuals groups just to assist with recovery so thank you all for coming and thank you megan for co-presenting with me and I'll hand over to megan to do her introduction hi thank you for coming in on this session we hope that you'll get something really worthwhile from it we're excited about it hey greg so I'm the well-being counsellor for the blue mountains and as beck said we have been appointed to help people with their emotional and also just in any emotional support part of our role is that we can come to your home or to the place that you prefer to meet and it's not time limited and so that's our goal to support um step by step program some of you would know some of our steppers and we are just moving on to the well-being side of it as well so thank you for coming today great thanks megan so we might get started but before I do I would like to acknowledge the diary gundangara and rajuri people the traditional custodians of custodians of this land and I pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging I also extend that respect to any aboriginal people who are here with us today okay so just a bit of background no news flashes here but natural disasters and uh pandemic um have presented australian communities with significant challenges uh in recent times not least of which to their mental health and mental wellbeing a bit of a local context so the lithgow in the mountains and hawkesbury have been's aware of the 2019 fires the 2020 flood events um and in you know from 2020 the ongoing pandemic and all the associated disruption to services economic instability you're having to learn ways of doing things this presentation will look at the concept of post-traumatic growth which is a reasonably new sort of concept that's coming into disaster recovery and how it how it relates to natural disasters specifically and community-wide um challenges so before we go into that just a bit of a step back so post-traumatic stress um is so when we when you're talking about that you're talking about stress experience as a result of um an event such as a fire or a natural disaster um it's a common normal completely unavoidable response to these sorts of challenges um you know a a fire is a stressful event so you people are going to experience stress from that usually resolves as the the danger in the situation passes and life returns to something um resembling normality um you know people normally transition out of that stress state small group of disorder or other diagnosis such as depression or an adjustment disorder um and these are diagnosable mental orders which are often best treated by mental health professionals or within that prism of you know care and treatment whatever that looks like for the individual um so then what we're moving on post-traumatic growth so we're looking at the other side of the stress I suppose and as the name suggests it's growth that's uh occurs or following or grows out of um a traumatic event um yeah the the it's it's important to uh you know realize that when we're talking about a traumatic event in this context we're talking about it's a little bit different from a diagnostic perspective you're talking about any event that has the potential to bring about transformation or and or challenge core beliefs um and that's a definition by uh american psychologist called tedeschi who was kind of the pioneer of this this type of uh thought or you know think about thinking about post-traumatic growth if you will um yeah so the you may hear in other places um usually thought of across five domains uh but it's it's important to acknowledge that it's it's really any positive change that a personal people experience um as a result of a traumatic event um but for the for the sakes of defining it and and talking about it it's generally thought of in five domains which are relating to others personal strength appreciation of life new possibilities or the possibility of new possibilities I suppose and spiritual growth so I will that's a good segue for me and I'll hand over to megan to talk a little bit about core beliefs thanks megan thank you yeah thanks greg so I'm just the next little while going to just uh allude to that last slide that greg had up there and it spoke of core beliefs and so the truth is we all have core beliefs and the a lot of these core beliefs about how we think about life and how the world should be and these core beliefs influence our dreams and plans and control and have certainty about our lives so that's happening in our brain and in our thinking and our lifestyle and then trauma or disaster comes along and it disrupts or fractures those core beliefs and when that happens it leaves us distressed and uncertain and we might find ourselves evaluating our core beliefs and needing to form new ones so we have a thought of how things should be that doesn't quite happen and suddenly we're in this position we'll go what is what is true and for me and what do I truly believe and when that starts to happen when we start to be thinking that way it's actually the beginning of what we call post-traumatic growth ptg so ptg often occurs without us realizing yeah the truth is that all of us uh after a disaster or a um trauma um move into this post-traumatic growth without even knowing that we're doing it but the reason why we wanted to do this topic today is that we think it's worth recognizing that that is happening so that you can you are stronger than you think you are and that the future you might be able to cope and be heartened about your future so now I'm just going to say let's look at the five domains of ptg and there they are listed there and they're what greg um read out so we're just going to do them one by one so the first one is relating to others and I've just got some examples um people have sent me come up with these little stories so a local story says I've learned learned that it isn't shameful to admit that I'm struggling to cope mentally and have had wonderful support from phn that's a primary health network red cross gateway which is step by step etc as well as from my close friends I attended meditation sessions run by red cross which which whilst it was very emotional for me it helped me enormously so we need people in our lives after a trauma disaster we need people in our lives that listen to us as we process what our core beliefs we need people who encourage us not to give up but to keep on going and to reflect back to us any positive progress in our lives that they see so those people can be friends family people who've gone through a similar experience or professionals such as counselors psychologists health workers and services and then the second domain that was mentioned is personal strength and here's a story for you after the disaster I had to take on a lot more responsibility in our family I discovered I was so much more capable than I thought and that I could make big decisions when I needed to I hadn't had to do that before on my own it feels good to know that I did and that I can if I have to so personal strength is um is often not even fully utilized or known about until the trauma pushes us to need it it's like under pressure what pops out and we discover that we have all these abilities and strengths that we never had to tap into before it moves us from being the victim to being the survivor or the capable one the courageous one or the self-reliant one and personal strength helps recognizing how we have grown in strength and abilities when we do that we recognize that we've grown in strengthening abilities and it increases our confidence that we can face the future I'm hoping that as we go through these that you might be able to see yourself in some of them and recognizing like go whoa yeah I do that um yeah you can tell your own story there of how even though you've had some horrible experiences that you actually have grown in some of these areas okay and the next one is appreciation of life and the story is what was wonderful after the fires has was how much little acts of kindness towards us meant so much to us I think I try to remember that now especially if I know someone who is and remember that if I do some small thing like make a cake or send a card call them up encourage them even if to them so after a desire a disaster or trauma our perspective changes and our priorities change we might slow down and smell the roses we appreciate what we have gained or what we didn't lose we don't take some things for granted and we realized there were new options and ways of living that we could consider so that it's that growing awareness that you've got a different perspective on how life is and what you appreciate about it and the next one new possibilities and here's the story a new combined village association has been formed the motto is forged from fire and through that I've met people who I knew of but hadn't ever met unfortunately pervert has stopped us having face-to-face meetings but that will happen happen in time so after the disaster or trauma we have this perspective that changes so that we start to write a new narrative for our life which includes our past but has hope for the future and we discover new options or opportunities we didn't consider before the trauma and or life despite what we have lost and the last one of these domains is spiritual growth and here's the story when I had my accident and became quadriplegic it made me think a lot about my faith in god in the end it deepened because I didn't have the ability to control anything happening to me but my faith gave me a deep peace so this can be a time of questioning like what is the purpose of life what's the purpose of my life it can you know have us questioning our religious belief beliefs and thoughts about the divine and life after death and it can also cause us to kind of look at the value of forgiving ourselves and others and I just appreciate this little quote a local resident sent me we can never prepare for change and that is the very nature of all of life adaptability and flexibility our mortality reminds us to appreciate every minute we get thanks greg great thanks megan great great discussion and great great use of the the you know framing those the domains you know very useful um so the next slide is talking a little bit about how you promote post-traumatic growth um so uh and the and these are just thoughts and and these are you know they are what what people make them you know as as I said earlier as as we said earlier you know it is really what the person experiences it to be um but just some just some thoughts around this uh providing opportunity opportunities for patient money growth that are relevant to the original event or within that context so the idea here is that growth as best supporters support it by addressing the context of the original trauma so if you're thinking about a bushfire um you know the trauma is the assault to the bush the the burning of the bush the the threat to property the threat to community the the disruption to community with covert it's the trauma is the disruption to community so it's best addressed by you know uh by the bush regenerating by taking care of the bush by addressing communities by building communities um which that's that's kind of what that that point is is trying to get out um leading on from that community-led and relevant programs that empower people so you know today is a great example of that to get ready expo where um you know people are taking care of what they're doing and they're you know taking steps to get ready and then prepare it's been shown that people that are more prepared for events have better outcomes on the other side of them so um you know the ability to have events such as this is is promoting um you know the idea of post-traumatic growth creative therapies that allow individuals to engage in the event from a different perspective or a new perspective um art music groups of that kind so you know the idea is that by by engaging in that kind of creative process you're able to change the narrative or or rewrite you know what has happened in a more positive light and and allowing allowing you to better process events I i suppose um examples from community songwriting uh workshops or you know communities writing songs or their own narrative around events similar to that is facilitating opportunities for community development or community projects so examples might you know he might be you know yoga exercise classes where that are delivered within the community where people can sort of can come together um and and experience something together um establishing things like community gardens um which you know goes back to the first uh point where you're kind of addressing the function of the trauma or the original um context of the trauma um you know facilitating community hubs where services and people can come together um in a unified uh way um providing services in the community that walk with people and organize follow-up and interventions as requests that's kind of what myself and megan's roles are about we're embedded in the community available to people available to organizations and yeah and focusing on the issues from within the community rather than people having to go out to to uh focus on on their um you know their health and wellbeing on that um and looking for people who may not be progressing with their growth so that's that's about um again being in community and then trying to get services or adapting services that are relevant to those people from the community so from from the context of where the trauma has come from um so as I said they're just some some some thoughts about that it is it is what the person says it is it is it is what the person experiences or communities you experience them to be I think megan's got some some more stories to go on with there yeah so we'll kind of wrap it up with this and just before I tell these stories um yeah like I said before it's valuable to stop and look at your own experience and to take note of where you think there's post-traumatic growth it's a fancy word but it really is what have I um changed or grown in um despite this being a terrible thing that's happened or a difficult thing that's happened heart in that so here's a couple more stories and um we'll go from there through the blue mountains mural relief fund which was offered to bushfire affected communities I now have a new friend whose community association is holding that money for our little village we click straight away and we have much in common and speak regularly and actually we got together in person a couple of weeks ago observing social distancing of course and we'll do so again soon and I accepted financial assistance for the first time in my 70 plus years I couldn't manage bushfire cleanup myself and there were very few volunteers to tackle the mammoth task in our villages I felt embarrassed to apply for financial assistance but I'm glad now that I did the monies that I received from charities etc allowed me to employ people to do the work for me and once that was completed I began to look forward for a change I don't want reminders of the bushfire now I'm ready to move on so this lady when I spoke to she wrote that first one and she said I just thought no I'll send that that's all but as she sat down to write it she suddenly started to come up with a whole lot of other ones and they've been scattered throughout this presentation of things she realised had been positive ever since the fire and some issues and difficulties that had been happening before so I said has it been helpful to write it down she said that writing these insights she felt more positive as she realized how far she had come and how she got there and that and this is what post traumatic growth is all about all right thank you megan well finished off great great summary there at the end so we've got some contact details for ourselves there and you know happy to happy to discuss any of this stuff further and then just some further reading as well for anyone who is interested so maybe if you go back to that last one greg then people might jot that down and feel free to give us a give you what you feel like you need to help you to keep on moving forward and experiencing ptg great thank you thanks very much megan and greg these details will also be available um through the recorded links and if if anybody um wishes to get in contact with megan and greg and has not been able to feel free to contact me through the get ready blue mountains email address and I'll make sure I can forward your details onto megan and greg to assist you so thank you very much for um for running us through that that really important part of recovery and I guess growth in terms of emergency preparedness is there any questions from anybody in the audience that they would like to ask I think you've covered it all doesn't look like there's any come through very very detailed very detailed uh presentation thank you so much again um it's really good to have people like you working within our communities to to help build our capacity and build that resilience for um for our future disaster events um I'll let you go with that we've got a few more minutes so we might be able to uh start up the other session and I'll catch you all in the next room thank you very much thank you thanks so much we do have one question just come in oh here we go hold on linda said it was a very interesting talk thank you so yeah thank you very much linda it was definitely an interesting talk and something that I guess we haven't really delved too much into over the last few years it's starting to much more find its place where it needs to be within emergency preparedness so thank you again great wonderful thanks thanks linda it's
Crayfish can be found in pretty much every creek and stream in the blue mountains that has flowing water in it each year the females they uh release young into the creek and it's these young which are the food source for the whole creek for everything in the catchment for the whole year these crayfish are a lobster size and in the old days people used to eat them but really these days there's no reason for someone to take out an animal that's been there for 30 years in that creek this is an animal that you can take your children down to see and their children can come down and see the same animal in that creek in that spot people see a dead crayfish they should report it if they see a live crayfish they should report it and bottom line just don't take any crayfish out of our creeks
Okay so where's the share down the bottom no I've got a chat a raised hand and a q a okay there was issues with getting to become a panelist um oh yeah we're having a few technical issues with tracy so um I might just pause our recording while we sort through those yeah generally one of the biggest stresses that they have is habitat loss so the further down the mountain you go the more extra diet of dermatitis we find in animals because they're in the brushed our possums because there's more and more habitat loss the further down you go they will make do with houses sheds cubby houses had them in granny flats anyway they can find somewhere to sleep they will their natural habitat is a tree hollow however it takes a hundred years for a tree to form a hollow and about 20 minutes to cut it down so they're losing their homes and then moving to ours they're adaptable and that's great but that does cause stress for people and we get quite a tails the ring tails tend to stay up in the canopy and don't come down to ground they'll run along the power lines to move around but brush tails will come to ground and can run out quite quickly in front of your car next slide so the babies because everyone loves baby photos on the left we've got two baby brush tail possums the middle is the brush towel a baby brush tail possum and the one on the right is a baby ring tail possum so we have when they're coming to care as orphans because mum's been hit by a car or a usual reason or rat bait a lot of mothers will die from rat bait as well we have them on special formula marsupial milk we have to monitor weight to make sure that they're developing as they would if they were with mum they have a diet of native flora which is their natural native diet rather than try to feed them on human food we try as much as possible to dehumanize them we don't want them think that humans are a safe place to go because not all humans are particularly nice um and we have a soft release program where we put them into a an avery in bushland and they stay in there for two weeks um just before maturity and that way they get used to the sounds and the smells and everything of that area then we open the hatch and they can come and go from that ovary until they've found themselves alive out in the bushland next slide uh we get a lot of calls where people don't know the difference between a ringtail and brusher so you can't actually tell from that photo but the ringtail is about half the size of a brush tail the biggest tellers to be able to tell the difference between them is the ringtail has quite short little ears rounded ears and they will have very short fur on the tail usually with a white tip on the end brush tail has much larger ears and I think it's got more of a kangaroo type base and they tail on them so they are very different once you get used to them they're very easy to spot the difference but we get a lot of calls out for baby brush tails and when we get out there they're adult ring tails so it's important to know the species that will it will help us know what to bring with us when we come next slide so the birds we get a lot of birds in the mountains and if you group the birds together they probably take up about 70 of our call outs for wires so the biggest issue we have with birds is for the rescues for this they can be at height which is always a challenge we have birds that have all different types of diets so we've got insectables carnivals nectars granovas we need to accommodate all those different diets and a lot of our bird carriers can have multiple birds from from different diet groups all at the same time now they are efficient for flight as well that means that they have evolved to not carry any don't carry extra fluid if they get into trouble they get stressed anything happens to them um there will be fluid loss which can mean uh significant damage to the bird itself so that's the first thing we're going to look at and probably try and treat with a bird that's been injured so for that side we've got a tawny frog mouth up in the top left uh baby rainbow lorikey is next to that and the they're so ugly they're cute baby corellas next slide so the types of rescues we get for birds is head injury we get a lot of those either hit by cars because they're flying too close when they when they um come in front of the cars or they're flying into windows doors everything else we can get wing damage when they're up in a tree particularly on really really windy days um some of the birds particularly the tawny frog mouth and the raptors uh get caught in barbed wire so the raptors come down they're trying to get a see the barbed wire they're coming in low they're coming flat and hit the barbed wire and then we'll spin and get tangled in the barbed wire the interesting thing about barbed wire is a lot of the rescues that I go to and I'll talk about flying boxes later but um even the the tawnies that I've pulled out of barbed wire the residents when I get there tell me they didn't even realize they had barbed wire in that back paddock so a lot of people have barbed wire that's just been there forever um they don't particularly think they need barbed wire if you if you have barbed wire have a look around take it down if you don't need it we see too many possums get caught in it tawny's get caught in it uh the raptors get caught in it and the flying foxes get caught in it so a common disease for birds is the parrot family they have the beacon feather disease so that's the two photos on this page that's they're they're majestic in flight and so it's quite um depressing to see a sulfur crested with beacon feather disease because it kind of takes away their dignity that that animal just inherently has and the other one is a crimson rosella I think it is um anything from the parrot family can get beacon further now the problem with beacon feather is you're talking about flock animals so they're hanging out together it's highly contagious it's um incurable and so you do not want to get it into the flock if you see a any bird from a parrot family that looks like it's losing its feathers like this the beak can get a little bit gnarly um call wise immediately if you can grab it grab it um the easiest way to get a bird is to try and put food on the ground get it to come to the ground and then throw a sheet over it as it's trying to work out how to get out of the sheet you can wrap it and take it to not only will it die painfully and slowly itself it will um transmit it to everyone else in the flock okay and we do get orphans as well um the critical thing I'll ask about orphans is a lot of people they find baby birds on the ground and so they take them home um you know they're walking along a bush track and they find orphans and they take them home the problem is mom and dad are probably around and unless you can tell us exactly where they came from we're going to have trouble finding the nest so have a look around if you find a baby on the ground have a look around can you get it back into the nest because baby birds are going to do so much better if we can get them back with mum and dad or take a note of exactly where you are yeah thanks so reptiles we do get a lot of different types of reptiles in the blue mountains this is a um a bearded dragon that I picked up in windmilly the poor think it was now they are fast uh we get a lot of different species of them and they're cold-blooded so uh with the cold-blooded it may be they go into like a torpor so it may be that they're not actually injured or dead it could just be cold-blooded and and um saving its energy if you've got any issues call wires next slide it's probably my favorite reptile is is the little blue tongue um and probably the number one type of reptile we get calls for usually dog attacks there's probably one a week where a dog gets its teeth into the into the blue tongue um they are pretty resilient but we need to get antibiotics into them and we need to um have a look at the wound we get a few hit by cars um and we do get ticks on the reptiles and you can get lots of ticks because they're crawling through through grass and scrub and various reptiles will also get types of fungal disease that we we will need to treat with medication next've been listed to be a threatened species they are impact significantly by climate change as I talked about with the birds they are efficient for flight so they do not carry any extra fluid on them because it would it would increase their weight when they're trying to fly so the issue is that once the temperature gets over 42 degrees for more than two days consecutively these guys suffer badly because they will have severe fluid loss they start to get kidney damage and they will drop like flies so not last year but the year before in emu planes which is the main camp for blue mountains we lost something like 3 000 in one day um they they just don't cope so climate change and uh global warming is going to significantly impact these animals now everybody's terrified of of bats we do have the australian backlist the virus I will tell you that less than one percent of bats have ablv the issue is you don't know what the one percent is so we ask people not to interact with the them if you find an injured bat if you find a bat on the ground if you find a bat wrapped in barbed wire if it's caught in netting at your house call wise immediately will send out a vaccinated bat rescuer for that they do live in colonies um large groups which if you live next door is probably quite noisy but they they are absolutely majestic creatures in flight and anyone interested can go down to the the rowing club um in penrith nepean and you can watch him come out on dusk from from the main camp down there now the reason why these animals are absolutely critical not just because they're cute and because they're little characters is they are the most prolific spreader of native seed so particularly the eucalypt and given the blue mountains gets its name from the the blue gum and these are critical little creatures for us uh without the flying fox there would be no koalas um there would be no lots of animals within australia so we really need to make sure that these guys are impacts that are coming next slide so the types of rescues we do for these guys now the main camps in emu planes we have had for the last few years a pop-up camp at certain times of the year in hazelbrook but they will fly up to 100 kilometers a night for food so the most common thing we get is netting uh so on the left you've got the um portal guy there and in the plum tree now there is animal friendly netting you can get if you want to keep animals out of your your fruit trees uh get animal friendly netting if you can get a finger through then an animal can get through it's not safe you can see there on that that little guy that the netting is wrapped around part of his wing there at the elbow part that is very abrasive and can cause significant damage and sometimes the animal needs to be euthanized I have had them where the netting has actually cut toes off them um because they struggle and freak out and try to get out the animals here survived and were healed and were returned so the one on the right is a little one it was fine it was just wrapped in netting we cut it as much as we could out of the netting left little netting on it because it was thrashing and screaming too much so the vet at north richmond was able to calm it down and get the netting off so we get netting we get barbed wire again like the tawnies and the raptors they come in low and flat hit the barbed wire that they don't see and then spin and so then when you get out there it's like a rubik's cube trying to untangle it from barbed wire it will have barbs caught in various parts of its body often tears in the wings which the wings are actually pretty resilient so long as you don't get the trailing part um the rest of it can heal but the bat's usually screaming um sometimes it's barbed wire on the top of fences so you're trying to do that've got barbed wire and you don't need it can you remove it um power lines are also common now lots of our wildlife use power lines as highways and that's fine ring tails particularly and I have seen brush tails do it the problem with the flying foxes is um they land on the lines and then they spread their wings out and once they're touching two wires they get electrocuted and it's usually mothers with babies who have gone off for a bit of quiet away from the colony and the resting position for flying foxes for the claws is closed um so they die on the barbed wire and their claws are wrapped around it and they we have to call endeavor energy who will come out and remove them from the line so that we can check for a pub okay so we do get if you just so if you do see a power uh um flying fox hanging from power lines core wires immediately will come out because we need to do a pub check on them to make sure's up there on the line so we do get some orphans um either through through the power line option or we have significant events particularly climate change and um when there's stress placed on a colony where you can have a pup abandonment event where you'll have hundreds of babies abandoned at one time so we have to go down and and try and spread those out to carers all over the place to keep those babies going because as I said they are threatened next slide the babies so the babies are very very cute um as as are all babies and the thing with these guys is they have look on the bottom they're on what's called a mummy roll so flying fox babies are born with the innate knowledge that they need to hang on mom can't hold them they hang on to her as she's flying and can't let go because they will die if they fall to the ground so as soon as they're born they know they need to hang on so when we get to hang on to otherwise they get incredibly stressed so they're called mummy rolls they get wrapped against a pillow so that they can hang on to that they're very funny creatures because when they're in care as babies they need to explore and they need to play so we have them on clotheslines with toys and yeah it's it's anyone who wants to be a back carer let me know just contact me and they're they're great great to work with next slide I'm just conscious of time we get microbats we've got a lot of microbats in the mountains um dozens and dozens of species up here there's there's over 100 uh across the country some of those species are threatened and again similar type climate change impacts for them it's it's getting too hot again less than one percent of them will have the lissa virus do not interact with them if you get bitten or scratched by either a microbiota or a flying fox go straight to the doctor and tell them that against australian bacteria virus don't think I was just a scratch it's fine no it's not you need to go and get yourself to a doctor so again they will also get severely dehydrated with stress and they're not carrying extra fluids so the first thing we do with these guys when we rescue them is um give them fluids by subcut method they live in colonies and they are insectables these guys you absolutely want these guys living in your yard if you can one micro bat and they're only about this big we'll eat a thousand mosquitoes a night so you absolutely want them hanging around your house you can get microbat boxes to try and encourage them to come next slide so the types of rescues for the microbes the most common one is cat attack they're little and they're flying around and looks like a toy I guess to look at dehydration and sometimes they get stuck in walls of houses and have difficulty getting out particularly people didn't know that the microbats were in there and the section they had the microphones in it okay next slide wombats again they've got climate change impacts um they were they know when to come out of their burrows at night because of change of temperatures that they can gauge from within the burrow so changing climates and and freakish weather patterns throw them out completely there were um there was research done in queensland last year they had issues with wombats that were starving to death because they didn't know it was starting to come out of the they burrow um they can get mange and I'll talk about managing a little while and they are heavy so um they're about 45 kilos for an adult wombat and I remember when I did the training you know the trainer was it's really easy you just bend from the knees and you you know put your hands around the middle of it head facing outwards and lift which sounds very easy until you're trying to lift a 45 kilo animal that doesn't want to be lifted um so if you if you don't try and handle and they're too heavy they live in burrows and they stress badly in care next slide so this this is mange the types of rescues we get are hit by cars and trucks and mange mange is probably our most common sorry um so the two photos on the left-hand side are one batsman mange it's incredibly painful it's caused by mites and it will just degenerate unless it's properly treated so on the right the photo on the right is a photo of um what we call mange flaps that we put out the front of wombat burrows and they've got little um milk bottle lids in them with cydectum which is a chemical that that kills the mites and so every time a woman goes into or out of the burrow it knocks the flap and and that tips the um psyjectin onto the back and that's how we treat them that way they're taking their sidechain also into the burrows so it kills the mites we also can get quite a few dog attacked uh're not going to get a chihuahua take on a a wombat and we we do get orphans usually the orphans of um from mums hit by cars next slide so the babies are very cute as they're all babies um top left I it's important to know that wombat pouches face backwards so everybody knows how kangaroo pouches work and possum pouches aren't that much different the one that pouch faces backwards because mum digs so if it faced forwards then you end up with dirt through the pouch as she's digging so the wombat if you find a dead womb and you're looking for it in the pouch the pouch will be at the back end okay now when they're in care we put pvc pipes half into the ground and encourage them to start building tunnels again we dehumanize these guys so that we don't want them to hang around humans and think their pets and we do soft releases from various carers homes across the mountains and down in molgoa next slide brews and wallabies um are beautiful residential encroachment this is this is another species another number of species who have found ways to live with humans and it's helpful but also causes them problems they are hunted they are large and feisty some of them the first time you go out for a rescue of an adult male eastern gray it's quite an experience and they have mob rule so they live in groups they're not solo animals next slide the types of rescues usually it's hit by a car probably the most common um we have had some hunting ones that we've had to do they can also get caught in barbed wire and we get the orphans that photo there is a photo taken by another wise member um that who she named soxy that little guy was burnt in the 2019 2020 fires um he burnt his feet and his tail escaping from the fires so um he did well and he was released back with a mob next slide so the babies we have specialized formula kangaroo milk we do the weight monitoring we have fake pouches groups so that they can be released as their own mob when they go out next slide we also get the small mammals so here we have a sugar ladder and then a feather tail glider and then a little anti-kinus little and fast next slide we also get that's a pygmy possum and we get a lot of bandicoots now I do get complaints from members of the public the bandicoots are digging holes in people's yards don't think of it as digging holes just think of it as they're aerating your garden for you there's not much we can do about bandicoots and you can't relocate a native animal from where it is next slide the other mammals we can get that's a platypus that came from winley water treatment center we've got an echidna there that came from blackheath we also have some quals certainly the upper mountains that have come into care next slide okay good um so what can you do um if you click for me back yep plant natives in your garden okay we keep some native food in the garden that they can eat um and then water okay they need water as much as humans do particulars we're now coming into summer whether it's little rock pools that you can put in or bowls if you put bowls and and stuff like that out of water a couple of things make sure you've got rocks or sticks in it for the small reptiles and the the small little marsupial so they don't drown they need to be able to get out of the water um the other thing is if you can try and put the water bowls into areas where there's some shade there's nothing worse on a hot day than a hot drink of water so if you try keep it cool if you can and put some in different areas where animals are going to be so put some maybe up on a rock shelf if you've got that in your garden um some down on the ground you might want to hang some from trees as well for for the arboreal animals about hollows and how that's the the um natural home for most of our native animals and how we lose a lot of hollows when they cut down trees so boxes are fake hollows we've got there we've got sugar gliders in a glider box and then we also have a bird nesting box always put them up in your trees give homes to ladies wherever you can in your garden know your locals know what animals you've got in your area they have patterns of behavior so you might see a possum that comes at nine o'clock every night if they don't come for a few nights there may be a problem know what's happening with the wildlife in your suburb what should domestic animals um I i don't want to cause an argument the number one reason we get call outs for certainly ringtail possums is cats domestic cats and I regularly turn up to homes but people will say to me oh yeah that's the third one fluffy's built in this month there's a pattern of at night that would be really helpful um think about the the the impact also on your domestics because while a cat can take a ringtail um a cat is actually quite at risk of an adult male brush tail if cornered so to protect your cat I i would keep it in indoors at night um just think about the impact that your domestic animals have on the wildlife you can have a car kit now I was going to do a joint presentation with blue ark for this they're currently putting together car kits they're going to sell to the community trying to keep it under 30 so the people can have it in their ready to rescue animals as they need to if they see one by the side of the road but some basic equipment you could have in your car is towels a blanket a pillow case is great if you put a pillowcase over your hand grab a brush towel by the the rump don't grab a brush towel by the tail go by the rump um and then pull the it to event that way and it's not going to hurt you and it's not going to hurt the possum and gloves gloves are always good to have both normal plastic gloves and also maybe some welding gloves think about safety for you and safety for the animal do not rescue an animal if you're all concerned um or if it's going to place you or the animal in danger you've got the wires number there and the next slide has uh questions but I don't know if we've got time for questions because we're at quarter past next slide has my contact details that people can contact now um if anyone does have some questions um feel free to answer uh ask them of tracy um I'll be actually doing the next presentation uh the the presenters that were were to do that presentation um have become unavailable suddenly so um we do have time to ask tracy questions if you wish I'll just stop sharing the screen um so that we then may go back to okay so regarding wildlife it's it's a very important part of um living in the blue mountains I'm actually an ex-wise carer myself from a past life and I can't stress enough how important it is to uh you know follow the the guidelines and things that tracy's put forward there um you know our wildlife's very precious and we need to look out for it no questions okay um as far as the car kit and things like that go we are also um in connection with blue arc so once these become available we'll be publicizing those on our web page as well with the get ready information so okay we do have one here from liz how can we encourage our resident possum to live in the possum box we have yep um okay a number of things if you can it sounds gross but if you can collect any of its species add it to some water shake it up and use a sprayer bottle and spray it on the possum box it will then have a scent on it and on top yeah I'm like I'm lucky I don't ever seem to have issues with the possums taking up residence in mind so um any other questions tracy no okay well thank you very much for um attending tracy sorry about our technical issues that we had but we did we persevered and overcome so um thank you very much for showing resilience right here while we're while we're doing our presentation um and thank you everyone else for attending if you would like to jump into the next room uh I will be doing a bit of a presentation on some of the citizen science projects that we can do uh to network and to also get out into the environment and um help monitor and and look after what what we have in our backyard um yeah I'm hoping I can call on my uh previous life as a as a wildlife ecologist and answer any questions that are unnecessary in that but we will uh be able to head those off to our um education people once we go in so everybody over in the next session
My name's jason adams and I'm the program leader of council's hazards material team our team a resource to be able to uh pick up illegal dumps throughout the lga it's a cost effective way for us to be able to just sweep through the mountains and pick up incense as they occur my team are out every day picking up illegally dumped material throughout the lga we work from laxton right out to mount irvine illegal dumping in the blue mountains impacts our environment impacts our social and our health and it impacts the financial so the hip pocket my team work quite closely with red which is the regional illegal dumping squad rid go out there they investigate all the illegal dumps that come through in our lga they'll assist us with signage I'll put surveillance cameras out they're the ones that issue our infringements along with our ranges once the investigation's finished it comes over to my team to start cleaning up the material the illegal dumping cleanup day is where my team and teams across the blue mountain and clean up illegally dumped material it's your couches it's your mattresses it's your fridges and we do get some construction waste quite a bit of construction waste and being a bushland area we do get quite a bit of green waste so your mulch and your tree clippings and your branches and that sort of stuff right throughout the lga the common areas is the walking tracks and the fire trails that are quite easily accessible to cars and to the public all waste that we collect gets transported down to our waste facilities either at katoomba waste management facility or a blackstone waste management facility there are a lot of resources out there so people don't have to illegal dump council provides bulky waste pickups that allow people to book in the service and put their waste out the front and get it taken for free to the waste facility they can check the council website um and it's got all the information there the ultimate objective is to clean up illegal dumps throughout the lga efficiently and cost effectively utilizing internal resources the organisation and just getting through and keeping the community safe
Give it a little bit of time for the attendees to come into the room just give it a few more minutes to allow everyone to come into the room and then we'll go on with our next presentation uh this afternoon's presentations are more around how to prepare ourselves uh both mentally and and sort of within those community links how do we form links and networks to assist us in those times when we may need a little bit of additional support um and and how are we how we can uh prepare ourselves as best we can both psychologically and physically I guess in preparing for emergencies so I'll just give it a few more minutes just to allow everyone in back from lunch yes okay what that looks like we might get started so um I'd like to introduce you today to liz cutter and helen mcgregor from um australian red cross and they're going to give us some talks on how to prepare ourselves for all sorts of emergencies and what other things we may need to consider outside and helen hi good afternoon everyone I hope you've enjoyed some of this morning's prep presentations they're absolutely fantastic and before I start I would like to thank blue mountains council and particularly beck southwest for organizing this expo which is so far been really informative so thank you very much back my name is lou skater and my co-presenter is helen mcgregor we are both volunteers with red cross and we've been activated numerous times including the blue mountains bushfires which we all remember in 2013 and more recently the floods which affected the um the uh nepean hawkesbury rivers um and of course last last year the 20 20 19 20 bruce forest that we've had um so as volunteers we've been activated I also would like to mention that we've been activated quite um intensely with covet support and quarantine support for people so we don't just do storms bush fires and floods we also do all sorts of other things what do we do in red cross is we support people mostly and our sort of original role help people um who have had to evacuate their homes during storms and fires but a lot of almost most of our work now is centered around helping people to be prepared for emergencies and also helping people to recover after emergencies which of course that preparedness and that response function goes over much longer period of time and it is about that ongoing support and helping people basically it is because if people are prepared for an emergency and they have with it get their thinking around what needs to be done um before during an emergency they tend to recover very much better and their reactions are so much better so first things first and this is something that um earlier in the day um andrew has also been talking about um think about what might happen prepare your mind the better you are prepared mentally as well the more able you are to cope with unfamiliar and unexpected and stressful events and that could be just a personal emergency or it could be bush fires floods and and storms think about how you would feel in an emergency so identify have a bit of an idea about your own stress reactions the kinds of things how would you normally react when something stressful happens in your in your life under normal circumstances and what do you do generally to keep calm and to control your thinking they're the kind of things that if you translate that into an emergency you will be much much better off so manage your thinking calm your breathing slow down use some positive self-talk and calm your breathing breathing now when we do these preparedness presentations we can't tell you exactly what you need to do and how you need to do it because each personal circumstances are different but what we are trying to do is to give you some of the tools that will help you that will help you it will help you yourself your family and also your community so they're the important things that we need to keep in mind so red cross also like fire and rescue and ses and and rfs have four steps and those four steps are quite similar to get in the know find out know where you can find the information that you need and find out how that applies applies to you take action now to find those things out don't wait till the fire season or don't wait till you hear that next week is going to be a heat wave find out about the things that you need to do now the second step is to get connected your family your friends your own household but also your neighbors get organized know what you need to do and how you need to do that and then finally get pecking so we're going to go quickly through each of these four four steps and I know we only have a short period of time and I'd like to at the end of it give all of you a little scenario to just start thinking about what you might need to do so let's go to step one oh first step is where do you find the information and again this morning we've talked a lot about various apps and information one bureau of meteorology has got really good websites and on your phones you've got your apps as well live traffic is a terrific app that you can put on your phone but if you want more information again go to the website the local council and we've been talking about this a lot blue mountains city council will have a lot of information and a lot of resources look at those don't just think they're there for everybody else they're there for you as well we've already mentioned this morning your local radio which is our the dedicated emergency services radio and it will give you if something happens up-to-date localized information on abc 702 obviously tv and internet net and the one that I put in bold there at the bottom are your neighbors that community that local street those neighbors are amazingly important for information particularly if you are fairly new to an area and maybe you haven't lived in the blue mountains for very long and you don't really know what goes on talk to your neighbors talk forever you know a couple of doors down talk to them and introduce yourself get to know your neighbors and work together on what it is you might need to do in your particular community there are some apps which are on the right hand side the red cross has got a terrific get prepared app and we'll have another slide about that later there is also and I really want to recommend people load that onto their phones the emergency plus app because if you use that it will tell you the exact geo location of where you are if you make a phone call to emergency services and then there's all these various other apps that um I would like to mention and at the bottom is resilience new south wales I don't think it's an app but it is a really good website now that we can use and I'm going to hand over now to helen because she's going to talk about the next couple of slides okay after we've done that we move to step two which is that's a matter of just thinking who you really need to liaise with through any sort of an emergency and the first point there is identifying who are the most likely people who will help you when an emergency happens and getting in touch with them to just um I guess make a pact with them that in in times of trouble um they don't mind being the one that you call on and vice versa you may be their go-to person as well and then that extends also to do you know other people in your neighborhood who might need help because one of the uh points which came home very strongly to me in all of the sessions this morning is that um we're a country where most of uh well a great deal of our emergency support networks or volunteers and that says to me that we all need to do our big thing we all really need to chip in to help our neighbors in trouble too so if you're home alone how are you going to get away if you can a plan in place to uh be able to support yourself if nobody else is around to help you and the one of the previous speakers was spoke very wisely about how are you going to organize your pets and and make sure that you do have a plan in place that contends with all the different possibilities getting to know your neighbors in one way is you know planning for emergencies a great way to get to know all your neighbors so it's a good good to keep that in mind and then one of the key things I think is to actually admit there are going to be times when you need help and uh it doesn't come easily to a lot of us but sometimes you really have to be very um forthright in saying you have a slight impediment you can't carry things anymore you're terrified of driving in traffic whatever it is you have to admit your limitations actually ask for help so next one then get organized good challenge for us all and you know every time I see this so many of us keep putting this off we keep saying oh yes I'm going to make sure I photographed all my important documents I'm actually really going to work out that I'll put them all on the cloud somewhere I'm going to dig out all those original copies of documents that you know you have put away someplace safe and that you know you you just have to make sure that you've got them so in addition to having a location where your original paper documents may be stored and easily accessible for you to flee if you do need to evacuate um it is always a wise idea to get an electronic backup and to record them in a number of different sites including a backup usb that can go with you and perhaps share with some of the other family members we were reminded this morning something that has become very important too is don't forget to make sure you've got all of your insurance documentation backed up as well so every time you listen to one of these presentations hear differently so it's a really good idea to just double check every once in a while methodically go through uh learn all the new technology which us all these are always having to do and uh just make sure that we're we're doing the best that we can to be organized to face any of the emergencies which are coming up so we can move on yeah I'd like to actually add something to that and that's a personal experience something that I've done during the the last covet lockdown because I realized that it's not necessarily the things like the important papers or your jewelry or the things of value that you value the most but it might be you know your kids toys or some furniture that you really attach to and you really like but the chances are you might not be able to put that in the back of your car when you're leaving if you had to have to evacuate so I've actually gone right through my house and I've taken photos of all lost them I would then at least have a digital memory of them so and that might also be your grandma's recipes and those kind of things if you lose them and you don't have them anymore they're the ones that you think I haven't got them anymore so if you've taken photos and backed it up on the cloud then that's a really good way of preserving at least some memories of those so good yeah I agree next one make a kit and that could be as simple as a backpack it could be a box it could be anything really but one of the things that I would like to say about it is you have a kit but there are always things that you can't really put in that kit and have ready with you so stick a label on the top that tells you don't forget your mobile phone and the charger don't forget to lock up the house and take your keys don't forget to put on those good trainers or those good shoes wearing so it's make a note of those last minute things that you need to do just before leaving the house and stick that on the top of the box so you've got that there and you don't forget them about them what sort of things to pack and that's going to be a really quick couple of slides here for yourself make a kit have some toiletries make sure that you wear good shoes long sleeve pants and long long pants and long sleeve shirts make sure you have your medication make sure you have your phone and there the um and the charger your glasses if you can't take your medicine at least somewhere on the cloud have saved a list of what medications you take and then of course some basic water and food items what is also important and I think it's relevant to do is to have a kit for your children and one of the things that I would really like to encourage and it's something that red cross have done through the pillowcase program is to in charge to us to an extent of their own kids babies can't_''_1043.439 do that of course but even toddlers and young children primary school-aged children age appropriate can have their own kids and if an emergency happens and you need to evacuate or go somewhere quick and the stress is really high if those children have something to do that they can focus on that is a really really good thing you give them age-appropriate control of their own kids and that empowers them to deal with the situation in a positive way and that will help their stress and also your stress so that's what I would like to say about kids for children we've already had a whole half hour talk about kids a kit for your pets and I think I will just add to that the importance of having that and mind you I've already taken a photo of my animals vaccination certificate which also has a microchip numbers on them so that that's really handy to have um what I would like to add to that is in an you know like a bad thunderstorm happens you're not going to be able to find them they're going to be hiding two things there don't send your children out to go and get them because they could put themselves in danger and the animals will be scared so they might point or scratch secondly make sure you can you bring your animals into safety well before the danger happens keep them inside and keep them secured well before animals and that's something that linda was already talking about animals will sense quite often changing the weather before we do watch them monitor them and keep them safe and then the final thing on that with the kit for pets is practice with them put your cat in its container in its cat carrier put it in the car with a dog whatever you have go around the block a few times so they don't get used to doing to getting into their safety area rather than resisting it that's my bit for the cats so we've got about five minutes left which I thinking exercise for for everyone and this is just one of them and um helen would you like to read out what's on the scenario yes I'll do it actually I love the idea of a scenario because after lunch we all need little prompts to keep us awake so this is everyone's chance to actually think through a situation and try to put yourself in that situation so the one that we've come up with it's 7 p.m and you are at home with your school-aged children your partner has not yet arrived home the dog and the cat are outside and it's been hot and dry all week a sudden storm whips up it's gone dark under enlightening the children are doing their homework you're preparing a meal suddenly you hear a massive crack a tree near the house has been struck by lightning and is on fire so here we go so you might like to if you have a pen and paper jot a couple of things down or maybe a few comments in a q a box should you have done something already beforehand do you need to get ready to evacuate think about what do you do to keep the children calm what should you do about your pets who do you contact do you need to contact your partner what do you think you might need to do in this kind of situation and while you're thinking about it you look outside and you can see that that fire has spread to the grass around it how close is that getting to your house and suddenly the electricity goes out you want to leave with your children and the pets you've got them all secured you want to leave you try you get them all into the car but there's no electricity and you have an electric garage door do you know how to open your garage door if there's no electricity and you can't use that remote control these are just some of the things you can think about and what I would like what you could do if you want to is when you're having a discussion what you need to pack or what you need to do set a bit of a scenario and have a practice with your family or maybe just talk to your neighbors about it set a scenario and say what would happen if this happened in our street what could we do because a scenario tends to get you thinking and think about really practical things you might do and also get your heart rate up so you will then immediately you read this you will then need to think about how do I calm yourself down so these kind of things are a really useful tool to use if you wanted to practice being prepared and just to finish this is a get prepared app that you can find on the red cross website um it's a really good app you can put on your phone and it helps you to think about all those things it helps you to to put in all that important information that you will need if you do need to leave home things that you need to think about is what would again things that we'll just get discussed this morning how bad does it have to be before you leave home don't don't leave too late where will you go how will you get there and what will you take so they're the really important sort of little bits of people that you would things that you would need and then finally the red cross website's got some really good information in there and resources and also some really good resources for children and then what I'd also like to say is that red cross volunteers are always willing and able to maybe do a talk to a community group or so about being prepared those talks can be anything from 20 minutes half an hour up to an hour and in the past year we've even been really clever and started to do these kind of things on zoom or we could also come once lockdown is over maybe come to your local community group and have a chat about um in a little bit more depth about what we can do to you thanks very much liz and helen um it's been really good to hear some of the the other side of uh emergency preparedness um there's quite a few things there we can we can think about to take with us uh do we have any final questions or anything for liz or helen before we move on to the next session you must have been very very thorough and everything's been answered so thank you very much again um and I'm sure we'll see more of you both in the coming years uh through some of our some of our preparedness messaging that we we're getting out so thanks again for coming along and um I will catch everybody over in the next room the next session will be done it's a a session held by our step-by-step recovery support services who are on the ground working at the moment within the bushfire and flood recovery across blue mountains lithgow and the hawkesbury so I'll meet you over in that next room and thank you very much again uh live and helen thank you thank you
 okay we'll just wait a few minutes for everybody to make their way into the room and then I'll introduce our next presenter susan mehmet from bluemount city council she's our road traffic coordinate safety coordinator okay so we'll get started susan is going to give us a little bit of a talk on what to do in emergencies as far as road safety is concerned uh and she will be able to answer any questions that you may have at the end um if you wish to ask questions throughout the presentation feel free to pop them into the q a box and I will monitor those for susan uh if we don't get to them at the end we can answer them and get back to you at some stage through our get ready blue mountains website so take it away susan okay thanks very much beck for that lovely introduction and I hope everyone's been enjoying all the presenters so far and I hope you can get something out of my presentation as well today we're gonna talk about our driving behavior and why why is safe driving behaviour is so important so keeping yourself and others safe on the road being prepared and driving safely is essential for reducing your risk and others risks of being in a crash particularly in times of stress you know we're out there and we're sharing the road and we need to think about others so today we'll talk about a few key things so I'll talk a little bit about the stress response ways that we can reduce our risks what to do in a breakdown and what to do in a crash you may or may not have been in any of those so what to do in an emergency and also how to behave on the road around emergency vehicles all right let's get into it so the stress response we've all experienced it um in an emergency our fight or flight response it it can take over so we you know we know that that's happening you know we have some physical indicators of fight or flight you know our pupils pale we've got a rapid heartbeat and breathing a bit like doing a presentation today um a bit of trembling that some of these or all of these might occur sometimes there's that feeling that you want to run away um and so this is our body's uh way of protecting us in times of emergency or high stress so it's good to just think about that and how you know we respond in times of high stress and think about it in terms of driving because look we may already consider ourselves to be experienced drivers we've driven for years you know we're we're confident we're capable but really stress can affect our driving choices on the road think about when you're feeling upset about something um sometimes it can be harder to take in information and we can be prone to erratic behavior poor decision making you know and our body um actually gets more fatigued when we're feeling really stressed out so I guess the other thing to say is that driving as we know requires attention and you know operating a vehicle or a car or what have you it's really a higher level function because we're operating a very complex vehicle so these are just you know this isn't exhausting exhaustive this is just a few quick tips to reduce stress so look really the best thing to do is you feel really tired fatigued or upset is actually to avoid driving giving yourself as much extra time as you can out on the road and if you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed by driving look taking a few slow deep breaths to um you know open up the diaphragm you know in through the nose out through the nose nice and slow um don't scrunch up while you're driving adjust your position be comfortable loosen your body you know roll your shoulders unclench your feet don't be find yourself you know gripping the the driving uh sorry the steering wheel with you know the old white knuckles so look to also reduce your distractions um so of course you shouldn't be driving with your phone on or down uh you know the music in the car um and another big one is avoiding conflict so this isn't the time to have a family argument in the car or take up issues with your passengers or have a go at other drivers on the road you really don't want to end up in some kind of you know road rage scenario so driving safely really is our top priority to avoid being in a crash or an accident so let's go into our next slide so the other big one is thinking about reducing our risks around speed so speed's actually you know one of the biggest factors on on crashes on the road and you know we say it time and time again drive to the speed limit drive to the posted speed limit sorry and also to the conditions um when the unexpected happens how fast your driving does really matter you know whether it's an animal running out on the road you know another driver doing something erratic uh near us you know I guess sometimes drivers might feel that little bit I'm experienced and control but you know you can't ignore some of those factors outside of your control so you know it can be weather and other things so being just a little bit over the speed limit it can actually make that difference between being able to stop in time or not at all and in a crash any extra speed means extra impact or force you know and we really want to prevent injuries and deaths on the road that's that's super important so another thing to really think about is fatigue sometimes we kind of I think underestimate fatigue think oh yeah I'm a bit tired but I'm you know I'm okay I can I can do it and um you know fatigue crashes can happen anywhere really like even close to home um so really again the optimal thing to do is not to drive while you're tired getting plenty of rest um planning a trip and taking breaks if you're going on a long journey you know we haven't in lockdown we haven't been doing those long drives so that's something really to think about you know we're getting we're more fatigued doing some of the regular stuff that we usually do and if you've got someone else with you sharing the driving is always good and um there is a really good website actually called testyourtideself.com.eu where you can go on and it takes you through actually a series of questions and a few little activities that actually show you how tired you are so I do recommend giving that a go at some point even if you you know before going on a holiday or a long trip it's a really good little website to have a go of so um you know the old stop revive survives really important because um you know if you fall asleep at the world you can't break you know microsleep doesn't enable us to stop and really being awake for 17 hours it does have that effect on performance so it's similar to having a blood alcohol concentration level of 0.05 so um something we to reduce risk is making sure you buckle up um we know seat belts keep us safe in the 70s when the um you know the laws were changed and seat belts came in um they were mandatory it really did make a drop in the road toll so ensuring all your passengers are buckled up and that's particularly important for um the driver um they're responsible for making sure everyone's got their seat belt on don't just think oh well I'm just going down the road oh we're just getting out of the way I don't you know I don't need to do it we'll be right but you know it's not a good way to think so the other thing is making sure your children are buckled up um properly that they've got the right child restraint that it's fitted properly you know their safety is really important they're small and they're vulnerable and you know we often recommend that um car seats for kids they shouldn't be more than 10 years old second hand making sure um it actually hasn't been in a crash even a small crash because sometimes you know that uh straps can be frayed or there can be little micro cracks in the plastic so it's really important to know the history of that seat and and for the seats to be um you know an australian standard so very important to check your child restraints and making sure you know kids aren't moving around in those seats don't leave it to the last minute so when we're thinking about emergencies and things like that when we're under stress you know the last thing we need to do is have to sort out the the child's car seat in the back um council does actually we do as part of our local government road safety program actually have a free program so for residents that need to get their child restraints checked or fitted before lockdown we had some quarterly days where people could come and get those checked and fitted at the moment we're running a voucher system so through her email and I can uh get back to you about um getting a voucher and our child restraint fitters at this point of uh very experienced and they will come out to you to get those seats checked or fitted um so it's a really great service the only thing you pay for is you know if you've got some hardware or new straps or something like that but happy to they're happy to answer all your questions and adjust your kids as they need to be so it's a really important service so there's a great website to also look at childcareseats.com.ou it goes through it goes through the laws you can compare types of seats um and it gives you heaps of information about um seats so and you know the ages and stages are in this seat so um yeah that's a really good website um also I think it's important to just reinforce this one about keeping your vehicle maintained you know as we're saying as I've said you know we we've just been weeks feels like forever but we may not have been unless you're driving for work you may not have been driving as much so it's really important I think at this time you to make sure you know that you're you've got your vehicle serviced you know do a bit of health checklist the indicator breaks lights and fog lights are working your tyres are properly inflated and aren't worn or cracked you know don't forget about that spare um sitting in the boot um that you know there's no don't ignore the warning lights on your dash um and that your exhaust is looking healthy there's no visible smoke emissions coming out of there uh and here's some more tips so no scratch scratches chips or cracks in your windscreen or mirrors you don't want those to become a bigger issue than they than they might look uh checking your wipers and washers are working engine oil and fluid levels are all at recommended levels and there's no oil leaks when excuse me when the car is and child car seats are fitting are fitted correctly and adjusted correctly not twisted when they're worn and of course that you you know you're not sitting on empty with your fuel that you've got adequate fuel levels yes we all think oh yeah but I know all this but you know it's surprising sometimes when we kind of let some of these things kind of go and think about a few things in terms of emergencies that might be helpful to carry in your vehicle so you know this isn't an exhaustive exhaustive list but having a torch a first aid kit maybe some high piece water you know an emergency a woolen blanket um some other things to think about in terms of our safety when we're actually traveling on on the road is having a safe distance so what we call the crash of audience space um you know keeping it sounds like you know common sense keeping sufficient distance between a vehicle traveling in front um you know so you don't you safely avoid a collision so you know on the road um it's really important to have a safe flying distance you know and they do vary because it depends on the conditions you know the type of vehicle if you've got a big vehicle that you're driving or and also you your right travel speed so um as a general rule when we follow a vehicle the driver the driver should travel three seconds behind the vehicle in front to provide sufficient time to avoid a crash and that's what it looks like in real life in a picture so you can see there's a few vehicles there they're a bit closer than um the example so you know um the three second gap as I just already said you know it changes depending on your speed it also you know depends on the um state of the road whether it's raining and so forth you know the fast because you know it's logical the faster you're going the longer it takes to stop and avoid a crash um and they there's that combined effects of reaction little bit of a list there of sort of estimated um you know vehicle uh space between vehicles there so at 60 kilometers an hour you need at least 50 meters of space right up to um you know 80 kilometers hour 67 going up to 110 on a freeway um 92 meters so I you know myself when I'm out there on the m4 I've you know witnessed so many people I'm driving incredibly close uh at very high speeds it's quite scary so whether or not you've ever had a breakdown or not um it's still worthwhile having to think about what to do um so the first thing to think about is to activate um your hazard lights um finding a safe spot to pull over if you can like a hard shoulder or in a breakdown lane um positioning your vehicle as far away from other traffic as possible um and you know ideally staying in your vehicle with your seatbelt on and calling roadside assistance or the nrma if you do have to get out of your vehicle like safest kind of side and away from the traffic especially at night try to avoid crossing the road we don't need any kind of pedestrian crashes um as well um standing clear of the road and moving behind you know safety very if that's around if it's safe to do so and and the whole thing about um you know changing tires don't don't attempt to change your tire unless it's you know totally safe that you car's completely against the um traffic so what about crashes um the key thing is to stop after a crash you should always turn off your ignition if you can't still working it reduces the risk of fire turning on your hazard lights if you're able calling an ambulance or police on triple zero if anyone is injured or unfortunately killed in a crash uh it's mandatory to help anyone injured in a crash so um the driver in a crash must stop and give help to anyone who's injured and it's an offence not to stop and assist the other're involved in a crash you must give the other person or people involved your name and address and your vehicle regio number um and also if the name and address the owner of the vehicle if you know it's not um if you're not actually the owner um so when do you need to call the police so police attend um and investigate crashes when you know if someone's trapped if they're killed or injured uh if anybody if any driver is believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs if a person fails to stop or exchange information at the scene if the police need to be out there to direct traffic or deal with hazards if a bus or truck needs to be towed away from the scene as well so you must always always give police at the crash scene your driver's license details any details of the vehicles involved your name and address information about any witnesses or other drivers involved if you can you don't um have to call police to attend a crash if there towed um sometimes you know if someone's involved in a crash it's not until later they might actually realize that they're injured or they need treatment so it's really good to report the crash to the nearest police station or the police assistance line on 131 um triple four if that happens so and if police don't attend the crash scene you must report the crash as soon as possible within 24 hours if you know the vehicles the vehicles towed there's property damage animals are injured or you're unable to provide you details to the other driver for whatever reason so it's good to make contact with police so here's a little bit of um advice on traveling during emergencies so it's always really important to follow the advice on travel from authorities and emergency services you know staying off the road as much as you can avoiding and avoiding driving during emergencies keeping keeping the roads clear um so there's you know there's those things that we get told around not driving in flood waters um control burning and bush fires are actually burning um you should only drive during bushfire as a last resort or if instructed to do so by emergency services so the other the other classic thing is um and you see it all the time particularly in weather events where people don't put their lights on so please try um be seen to other drivers and put your lights on and also keeping up to date with road closures and advice there's the livetraffic.com website and also there's an app and you know having um abc radio on there the emergency broadcaster so what about how we drive around uh emergency service vehicles so it's really important to give way to emergency service vehicles keeping clear if you're in the way of an emergency vehicle move out of the way as soon as you can safely move into that left lane or into the shoulder or break down lane drivers on both sides of the road should be prepared to move out of the path of approaching emergency vehicles and if you stopped remaining stopped until is green if you not stop slowing down and and stopping if it's necessary to avoid a collision with an emergency vehicle so it's also really important not to cut in front of them and as we know um you know with fire trucks and so forth you know emergency vehicles are large and they can um take up plenty of space like trucks like regular kind of trucks they've got you know blind spots um so we need to be really careful about that um being cautious when we see you know flashing lights or hearing sirens emergency um vehicles traveling when they've got the audible audible sirens or flashing lights are responding to something urgent we know that they're not actually required to follow the road rules as long as it's safe for them to do so another important um thing around preventing crashes with emergency service vehicles so um you know crashes with a you know a fire truck or an ambulance and so forth it's not only impacting you know the people involved in the crash but those whom so things not to do don't move your vehicle suddenly and without thinking don't slam on your brakes or stop suddenly if you hear or see emergency vehicles don't speed up to follow the emergency vehicle to get a clear run through the traffic I have seen that happen don't slow down or stop to take a look at a crash like they don't really need um an audience uh don't drive too close to like the stationary emergency vehicles they might be positioned close to the road and and maybe um all those emergency staff are actually in and around vehicles and so we want to give them as much space as we can so try not to obstruct the traffic you don't want to be the cause of another incident it might not be a great idea to play extremely loud music that's inhibiting your ability to hear what's going on around you and you know peter often spot people actually in their headphones as well which isn't great and it doesn't make you alert on the the emergency services rule was brought into effect after a bit of a trial for a year so the the thinking around that is that um it's there to look after those who are looking after us and so um you know slowing down and giving emergency vehicle space is really important so the rule applies when we pass in a stationary tow truck or a breakdown assist vehicle like an nrma vehicle when they're flashing their yellow lights and it also applies to emergency vehicles you know ambulance fire trucks police ses and so forth so um after trialing it this is what they what transport have come up with so on on high speed roads a speed limit of 90 kilometers or more so you know things like the m4 slowing down safely to a speed there's reasonable for the circumstance it's not always easy to slow down to a really really super low speed but slowing down is really important um on lower speeds roads so with a speed limit of 80 kilometers or less so like our local roads in the blue down to 40 kilometers is what you need to do so the other idea is that motorists must provide sufficient space between their vehicles and emergency services and breakdown assists so now I'm going to um actually try and play oops I'll just go back I don't just going to check if this is playing here I'm not sure if we're getting sound here okay so I'm just going to screen share to youtube because I'd like to actually um play this rule so just bear with me for a moment okay just going over to youtube not finding it okay well susan's looking for that we'll just say has anybody got any questions that they would like to put into the question box for susan to have a look at um once once we've finished okay it's not working oh just just one moment I'm hoping to get it happening these are some of the technical glitches that I'm sure everybody has uh had to deal with during covert and our lockdown and working from home so much thank you thank you all right a road rule has changed for everyone's safety when you see the flashing lights of tow trucks breakdown assistance or emergency vehicles stopped on the road and the speed limit of the road is 90 kilometers per hour or more slow down safely to a speed that is reasonable for the circumstances and move over to provide as much space as possible between your vehicle and the stopped vehicle as well as any people who may be on the road on a multi-lane road this means moving over out of the lane next to the stopped vehicles if safe to do so you may only increase your speed once you have passed all vehicles and people involved on roads where the speed limit is 80 kilometers per hour or less slow down to 40 kilometers per hour until you've passed all vehicles and people involved these requirements apply to vehicles traveling in both directions unless the road is divided by a median strip this rule applies when you're passing stationary police ambulance fire and rescue rural fire service state vehicles displaying flashing blue or red lights the rule now also applies when passing stationary breakdown assistance vehicles and tow trucks displaying flashing yellow lights do okay I hope that you all found that um useful um my I have a last slide but it's basically um the list a list of some of the links that I talked about through the presentation and it's also linked to that youtube so um I think that that will be provided at the end of the the today's sessions um as some in the resource list so I'm just going to have a look and see any questions and hopefully I can answer them um yeah we do have one there um susan in the event of an ins of an instruction during an approaching bushfire to leave immediately and there are too many vehicles to organize streets in the mountains with a staggered approach to leaving as it seems there could be a bump at a bumper issue which we often as we know uh this happens regularly across the mountains in all areas uh out yeah um yeah is there any instructions to turn left or right onto the highway depending on the direction of the fire um I think that's something that we would definitely have to take on notice I don't know anything yes I'm not sure that I'm in a position to be able to answer that because I mean I'm just wondering if um you know emergency services like police or rfs would be directing traffic so I don't feel um I can give you an answer there yeah that would be something that would be decided um by the the agency in in control of and police police are in in charge of all evacuations so um I can take that that question on notice um from our our question ask her and um and get back to her with a like information but at this point uh there is nothing that I'm aware of in any of our emergency planning that specifically says that that will be something that is going to occur um and it would be dependent on the the incident as to what what instructions would be given so we'll have to get back to you with that one it's a great question so thank you liz who asked that question so yeah um thanks for listening to my presentation today and bearing with the technology um so I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the presentations thank you thank you very much for coming along susan um we're going to break for some lunch now so um our next session starts back at oh I think it was 12. 1 15. so we've got a half an hour for break break for lunch um so yeah sometime around 1 15 we'll start the next next round of sessions and thank you very much susan for for coming and giving us all of that wonderful information okay thank you
In the blue mountains crayfish are threatened in a number of ways first up we have storm water storm water carries pollutants so anything that's on the ground in the urban areas will be picked up and washed into the creeks with storm water pesticides are a particular danger as we saw at jamison creek in 2012 when at least a thousand giant spiny crayfish were killed overnight we quite often find illegal traps that people have put in the waterways to try and catch crayfish any kind of fix trap is illegal in the blue mountains platypus turtles lizards snakes water rats all of these amazing native animals can be killed by people putting traps into the water in an attempt to catch crayfish please leave crayfish in their creeks it's the best place for them if you'd like to help us help crayfish get involved in the blue mountains crayfish count you
Okay we'll just give it a little bit longer for some let everybody into the room just give it another minute see if everybody's finished their cuppers keep up at the 1045 mark this while we're waiting every anybody that's online uh all of these videos will be recorded all these presentations will be recorded and as I said earlier available to access for you to watch at a later date if you have any any family or friends that you think may be interested in having a watch of some of these at a later time get them to register as well and they will then also get access to the recordings um online okay so we've hit the 10 45 mark so we will kick off I'd like to introduce inspector john hughes he's the blue mountains unit commander at um of the ses and they're located at kitumba um and I will let john have a chat with you about what we can do to prepare for storms and extreme weather thank you john expect and uh thanks everyone few things with the scs and more about on naturally focusing on storms and what's coming for the uh summer months and how to make sure that you're prepared for uh storm activity and then that leads on into winter and so forth but we'll just generally focus on the sun ones I'll start off with a presentation I'm just going to uh share a video and then what we're going to do is also go through the video again towards the end so this is a video that the ses prepared for preparation of storm just gives you an idea then we'll come back and go into a bit more detail of that video let's give it a second so so is so oh right we won't go on anymore on the video so um I hope that video came out okay um now I'll go on to a bit about what the new south wales ses is because a lot of people just aren't really sure what this yes wearing orange overalls uh so the ses is a governed uh organization government under the statements service act of 1999 new south wales and we actually have three combat roles or core responsibilities in that act so uh one of the the big ones which people see across uh new south wales along particularly the east coast are floods which uh we actually get involved with in the blue mountains because we do have a responsibility under the hawkesbury flood plain as well as we are a community that's impacted by what happens in the hawkesbury and the nepean area especially if there's a major flood but across the state we've got that responsibility our teams have also gone out to western area flood operations which happened about 10 years ago people might remember places like hay and griffith and all those places got flooded out and those floods actually took about three or four months to go through those towns so that's we also provide support there storm damage is our main call for the blue mountains unit that's an incident only happened uh happened down at blackstone where you can see um which is a common picture that happens across the blue mountains about trees coming down on houses and the other one which here in the blue mountains we don't be so much concerned about but it is our role is tazani in new south wales as a combat agency to prepare the communities and we do have a lot of communities along the coast which would be impacted by zazami a lot of people do ask does this army really affect new south wales uh the last uh clear evident one was only about three or four hundred years ago um where they found a lot of evidence in the wollongong area of the disarming that actually went up onto the hill so there's quite a large wave so and the risk of zazami coming from new zealand is always there so but where we take on that role probably because we already have a flood role so that's why they combine the two efforts together but up here in the blue mountains we do a lot of lot of support roles uh mostly country owes including a hawkesbury area um unit they're responsible for land uh rescue completely motor vehicle accidents animal rescues domestic uh rescues uh they do a lot of horse rescues in the box speed that's for sure I'll tell you that vertical rescue we do vertical uh support here in the blue mountains in fact that's one of our members there uh during clamp australia day a few years ago so we actually had to have qualified vertical rescue members to go down there the new south wales police responsible vertical rescue up here in in the blue mountains due to the high risk of those sort of events happenings particularly in land surge we actually have teams that are trained to state rescue board requirements and they can assist as a support unit we um I mean bushfire is the big incident obviously the big risk of the blue mountains as we know um but we get quite well involved in bushfire support during the operation we'll assist the firefighters of logistics support try and get food we've spent a lot of time working particularly with blue mountain city council on the make safe program which is actually removing a lot of burnt and dead trees but still risk properties so we actually get involved in that that side no and land search is another part that particularly the blue mountains unit gets involved with so we get activated about uh about 15 to 20 land search operations per year the police do have um close close to 200 land search operations but we just get involved in the quite large operations that they need to support in so that's where just the background firstly also before we go into about storm uh so the new south wales ses it is a state government organization with units but we comprise completely volunteers about 10 000 state-wide and we have 300 support staff mainly focused at our state headquarters at wollongong but at a local level we cover the blue mountains local government area so it's easy to see where the ses unit is it's exactly the same boundary as the blue mountain uh that's how they work our unit has about 170 members or volunteers basically consumer and falcon bridge so we're all volunteers at the local level including myself um and we attend on average over the last 10 years it's been about 800 storm jobs per year a couple of years we had about two two and a half thousand and a couple years we had about four or five hundred jobs only so but that's how many storm instances uh within the that's they've been the blue mountains only so and as I said we attended about 15 land search operations per year depending on how the police won and we do have those responsibilities of the hawkesbury nepean flood plan which includes looking after the community of emu plains in a major flood there are 9000 residents that will be impacted by a flood on the western side of the river and a major flood they could see them cut off from the east so we do have a responsibility looking after that community as well so just to give an idea generally goes from october to march each year so the last one the new south wales sea state wide received 37 470 cores for assistance of then there was 26 over 26 000 ratio storm damage jobs that we had to attend to and there was flood rescues involved so uh a lot of members a lot of people remember earlier this year we had quite significant floods on the east coast and in sydney um where again but damn it's been uh just below 100 um and having that risk there we've had those flood rescues more so up the north and south coast with those uh cause of flood rescue so just been getting ready for storms let's have a look a bit more background and there's something we remember about uh what does hit us like giant hailstorms people say what's a giant hailstone so that actually exists a giant hailstone is technically any hailstone that's greater than five centimeters across and the largest hailstone north new south wales was actually 14 centimeters across and one stone and only last week that was uh 16 centimeters in diameter so that's a that could do some damage um just locally we've had the hailstones on that side so that one those two hellstones that was actually a job at blackstone's that uh we went to so and that was there are lots of hailstones like that and I'm sure a lot of residents here have had large hail storm operations at all so that's a large house stone uh is two centimeters to five centimeters in size and can do quite significant damage particularly to solar panels uh which we'll go into and also older type uh tile roofs a lot of the concrete roofs that once they get over 20 years old they start getting brittle and that's where we start getting issues with house old storms like that trees are another issue which you can't it's hard to plan for and so this job here was only a couple months ago in the mid mountains uh you can see our team is removing a tree but then actually removing tree that still standing it's quite healthy the branch just snapped off a large branch uh the part that they're working on there is actually the small bit which actually pierced into the house and caused some extensive damage to the laundry so they're removing that making sure they put cover over the whole roof on the other side it actually impacted the solar hot water service too so that's um but how do you plan for that you look at trees around your house you go ah it looks fine to me if you if you've got any doubt you get into an experienced arborist or a tree surgeon and the ses is about you know being a government organization we don't actually have any we and we can't recommend any particular company that's not allowed but there are quite some good uh experienced uh arborists and tree surgeons in the blue mountains region they're happy to give advice and also bloomington city council tree preservation they've got a very important role I've had three brazilian preservation officer involved in given residence advice about certain trees and it's even interesting they came and saw a gun tree and you think that the gum tree was safe and he actually said no it's not it's actually an introduced gum tree is from western australia it's a weed as far as he was concerned and it was going to cause some troubles and the resident had to remove so you can actually get advice from uh different sources on trees because they're hard to predict no one would have predicted that tree would fall on the house but there are things we can do to try and get ready and the ses has eight types of steps that we can um get ready for storms one of the important things is maintaining your yard and belt needs so secure any store or store items that could blow around in a strong winds so in the picture there they're moving that the house the the garden furniture is really um that lightweight plastic that likes to fly around and when it's flying around it uh seems actually go through and cause some damage to windows and other objects like that and it's a projectile but the big thing you can see the gentleman there is uh pegging down a very important role is um a trampoline for anyone that has trampolines there are some good photos on the internet and you've seen them come up probably on the news in the last year of particularly last storm season there was one which I couldn't find the video but it showed a trampoline in northern new south wales going flying and it flew across about three homes before it landed on someone else's roof and uh caused some extensive damage so if you have objects like that you can't just pack up peg it down uh number of pegs around the footing I think a lot of modern trampolines for example actually have uh parts where you can actually peg them down if not you can rope it down with tank guy ropes some of that but secure any of those sort of items around is the main important thing the um regularly prevent blockages so this really rolls in very similar to what the rfs say get ready for fires is very similar for ses cleaning up the stuff around your yard particularly your gutters so with the gutters and the fire we know that can be a fuel for ember attack in a storm and what happens when they fill up with water the issue with the australian design for buildings is with your gutters the inside of your gutter is actually lower than the outside of your gutter so when they fill up with water and your down pot's blocked the water actually flows inside into your ceiling space and then water being water will find the first point eventually where it's going to fall down and into your house it could be for a light fitting for example so try and keep your gutters clean at all times so it's good for bushfire prevention and it's good for storm prevention the other one also not just that we also have issues particularly in the upper mountains if we do have a hail storm and down pipes uh it's hard to control it and we've been to a few jobs where hale's actually blocked the down pipe and we've got to clear the down pipe um because it's just frozen up so we do get winter hailstones um or hail storms they're not as common as the summer ones but when we do get them in winter that's the problem they do freeze up and that's where we get those blockages but keep keep the leaves out the best you can and if you if you can't it's it's best to get some advice I know um uh there was mention about the ada program that the rfs run which is the one-off thing and that could be part of it but it's a one-off thing just um maybe if you're unable to do your own um maintenance it's uh just to put some pennies aside to try and get someone to come in and do it you know a couple times a year though it should be right it just also part of that is trimming branches and trees that could potentially fall on your property so that's just looking around see what branches are over your house and it might look healthy but and it also goes in line with being prepared for bushfires as well keeping that foliage away from your house it's the same as storms storm comes in that that branch might look good and it starts flopping around when the winds are blowing 50 to 100 kilometers an hour it could actually bang into your roof could break off and cause damage so just keep it keep your foliage clear from your house is the best prevention for any damage on there fix any damage to your roof including broken or missing tiles and sometimes that happens when people just are unaware or they can just see there's looks like a crack but even a crack in the tile can actually cause uh water leakage into your house it's quite surprising um and that's that's because one of the biggest shots we cause we get for is people say hard for our ses members to attend to in the sense it's almost impossible to find out what's happening there because water when it leaks into a ceiling and it's just a little minor cracked hole and it's a wet tile and it's nighttime we can't actually it's very almost impossible to trace where the water is coming from if it's quite clear we can see crack tile uh it's during a storm and you call it ocs and what we can do is what our guys do they if you've got spare tiles some people pick spare tiles it's great if you build a house and you've got spare tiles that are because tolls change design keep a few spare tiles under the house or in the shed or some of that because if one breaks our members can actually go up there and they'll just replace the tile but if it's um if we can see your cracked old they go up and wrap plastic around it until you can get a uh qualified uh when it's not stormy and if you notice there's a broken tongue getting a qualified tradesman don't wait for the storm um because that's a bit too late also a very important thing is checking insurance policies up to date and current so it was highlighted in bushfires about people are being underinsured for the cost of rebuilding homes and it's not so much even for storms that just rebuilding hands it's a lot of damage claims for storms doing from insurance companies is for just damage not replacement of a home um very rarely does a storm wipe out a home it's more so the damage that of course to a roof which could be you know several thousands of dollars damage to your roof just make sure that's up to date and it's um so you just have to check with your insurance provider on on that do an emergency plan and part of that emergency plan it's very similar to your uh doing a fire plan playhouse ticket off very similar for a storm plan so communicate with your neighbors particularly if you've got elderly neighbours or for the elderly see if you speak around with your other neighbours about helping each other out during an emergency so more so for bushfire yes but even through a storm so I'm not sure if anyone's here that remembers the 2011 storms of black keefe's where certain parts of black league had no power for seven days and people had to leave but were they ready to leave make up a plan what you would take to leave you know do you have a list of your medications that you must take you know do you have any uh clothes ready to go your photos your ids things like that uh one thing I remember people saying about passports is really important to carry not so much because because of the identification it's just really impossible to replace if you lose a passport during a bushfire or a storm so just just have that sort of suffering and even have some food and drinking water and ready to go I know it's you might get a bit more time um because there might have already been a fire started storms come up so quickly just to have knowledge and your family have knowledge what would happen if a tree fell through my house and I had to get out and you know you're safe but what would you do so have a plan make sure your family and friends know what that plan is they even have a storm kit ready so you can have a storm kit a lot of the kits on the ses website you go the ses website ses.nsw.gov dot ayu just google state manager service get ready and it comes up with these things and it goes through what could be in the kit so even actually if I go back to the last side actually how to do the checklist on down the side about uh portable radio spare batteries a lot of people still actually do do portable radios with spare batteries so it's independent from power the abc which is our official station for emergency warnings so obviously sydney has an app have that and that's good good good to have have a torch of spare batteries and even for me in our our house here we have a central the center of the house is the kitchen and all my family know that we always keep a torch that's uh at a certain point because in the middle of the night if it's all blacked out you can hardly see you know you can make your way to where the torch is and also keep another torch near the office at the other part of the house and in just those sort of locations because it's always when you have that blackout in the middle of the night go oh I can't see it I can't find my torch so just always keep a torch um charged up at a certain location first aid kit so a first aid kit is not about medication the first aid kit is about injury so it's about the bandages and all that sort of stuff too so if if you had an injury had a cut or so have your first day keep always stocked up in a place that's always central that you know you can access quite easily candles and waterproof matches some people like to a lot of people have candles because they're just not trusting on electricity anyway um have your important papers including emergency contact numbers all ready to go have an idea where they are they might be in a folder so I keep my my insurance documents for example they're in a folder part of the filing cabinet and I know if we got to go I know we can just open that part of the filing cabinet and just grab that folder complete folder out and it's got all our papers plus with modern technology anyway most of our stuff is online but I still like that physical paper contact and a lot of people do like that physical paper or your insurance policies important papers and you know your birth certificates marriage distributes that sort of stuff yeah we keep that all in a central folder that's secure but it's easy for that if they have to so and there's also about having waterproof bags particularly in storms you're going to be running out of house it could be running pretty heavy so that's that's what goes on there so that's about having an emergency fit if photos if you haven't scanned your photos on your computer you know a lot of people uh there's a big impact I know sound bushfires people say I miss my photos you know it's just great if you if you know you've got your photos in an album grab them and getting ready listen to your local radio station for other media and weather warnings so abc or you've still got the am radio the 702 is what they broadcast on or it's abc sydney on the app uh they're online you can go on your computer that is our official broadcaster for uh weather warnings in new south wales and they don't do a good job as soon as the bureau put up a weather warning uh they obviously announced that warning for whatever broadcast area is so obviously sydney you won't necessarily hear unless they switch over to abc national you won't necessarily hear a weather warning for say grafton or bigger but you will hear it for anywhere in the blue mountains even though we're in a slightly different weather district they'll still broadcast for the warnings for our area so and also keep up to date with our facebook page the new south wales is here blue mountains facebook page if you're on facebook and also the new south wales ses facebook so as soon as the bureau of meteorology issue a weather warning to us we get an alert straight away um from them and we actually rebroadcast uh verbatim what the weather bureau put out to our community so normally if we get a weather warning we'll have a rebroadcast on our facebook page within a few minutes uh we have a team of volunteers that just monitor social media to make sure that sort of stuff it also feeds across our twitter account and other accounts are all linked haven't_''_1595.52 on your notifications so uh in the ses we avoid uh putting up lots of little rubbishy ones we will put our preparation stuff about um for storms but we try and make sure that if an alert comes up it gets noticed so also uh a lot of people try and watch the weather so sometimes it could be complex for some people that understand whether that much but if you go in and just search um the bomb bom bureau of meteorology and bring up the weather's weather zone so we are the central tablelands forecast area and actually you can see there was yesterday so we actually got some teams out right at this moment actually fixing up some storm jobs that we received yesterday or in the live blue mountains we had a couple of jobs in the upper mountains but all the jobs that we're attending to one was an entire roof came off a uh property at mount riverview I've got a team down there um making it safe and we added a couple other where trees are full you can see what the forecast that the bureau actually put out so that was yesterday morning I shot that and that was they forecast showers possible afternoon storm well we didn't see the showers we could do some more showers um but if you read into the detail they've got their gusty winds in their forecast there once you see that for uh the central tablelands and you click on say springwood or katoomba on there if you see gusty winds forecast just go back to those preparation things make sure that outdoor furniture is secure make sure anything outdoor is actually secure so just just check on that so and keep an eye on it the photo they also bring up the radar you can when to get those summer storms so that's a really good summer storm there that's actually uh considered the date at the bottom of the 23rd of december back in 2012 uh so a typical summer storm you can see out here between warrior damage demons caves there's a really deep red there on the weather radar that 50 millimeters per hour rain falling which is flood rain so it's a very small concentration and it would have done some good falling therefore again then that's for sure but that that could be only a few kilometers wide it could pass within five minutes of your your location but in that time if it's falling at say 50 to 100 millimeters of room which we've had it could actually flood through houses and things like that so that's where we've had in the past so earlier this year we actually uh went through about 50 to 70 tons of sand so at our falcon bridge and our consumer locations we actually keep large sand pits and members of the community and sandbags members community can come and get sand in emergency our teams actually take sandbags out to the people where they might have that flood impact into their house because some properties are due to design problems though they might have flash flooding coming into their house so okay watch the traffic also and this is probably more so in the actually uh responsibility on the ses as well for any storm damage from the snow affected areas but uh particularly in winter when snow or ice might close the highway go to livetraffic.com simple website livetracker.com that's actually a transport for new south wales website that looks at all the highways major roads across new south wales and they give you the good updates if there's any road closures as well the other important thing which seems to was mentioned on the eight points from the ss was planned for your animals always have a plan for your animals I know this is uh before we race in bushfires it's also just as important during storms during a storm keep your animal secures in inside you know or you know whatever you have in place for them to be sheltered I know some people have some very large dogs and they um they might have a kennel somewhere in the garage or something like just so when the storm comes along just make sure they're secured um and looking out for others really important thing this pictures on floods but there's so talk to you if you've got ld neighbors or any little community group just keep an eye on each other uh particularly before storms help each other out before the storm and afterwards it's just make sure everyone's okay it's the best way is looking after each other in the storms so I'll just um just quickly on that video you will see there would have been some chainsawing in that video only if you do operate a chainsaw in that make sure you do it to the specifications that the manufacturer the chainsaw has and the safety there's a point there about not raising chainsaws above your head our ses operators never raise the chainsaw above the head we have specific pole saws we do chainsaw training which is very intense or training what our members do but if you're going to operate a chainsaw make sure you do it very safely they are a dangerous bit of equipment if you can't chainsaw well then you get someone in they can that can about what we uh sort of covered on just another spread of it coming up on to time so um uh on this I think I'll ask um um uh back if there's any uh further further questions I think we'll just move on to that one so okay so there's been a few questions just about the video um yes so within within the uh the resources section of this this today um I have developed a a bit of a guide I guess uh which has got a lot of the the resources that we will be using today from the different agencies uh which have the the contact details and links to be able to access those so um yeah we can certainly provide those for you yeah I'll put up on now asus facebook page because I don't think it's actually on there they did the video last year and I think it sort of fell by the way so I don't make sure it's back up there because yeah it's it's a great video's back up there and I'll check it it might be on our ses state face uh estate web page as well so it's seo nsw.w go in for just look at prepare for storms and should be there but I'll I'll re put the link back on the new south wales ses blue mountains facebook page so we don't have a local web page this is the one web page at state but we have our local facebook page so all right well we're running over time so I'd like to say thank you to um john for for giving us that very good information um and we will be jumping out of this room into the next room which is uh presentation from um fire and rescue new south wales so thanks very much for your time john and yeah we'll see you in the next room okay thank you very much in this one
Hey folks and welcome to love local live we are witches leap and this is series 2 of this awesome events um we want to start off before I even do anything else just to say thank you to the blue mountain city council and all the people who are involved fusion boutique shelter studios you guys are here already it's just awesome as a musician to know that your local community is going to back it and when times are really hard jump up so thanks to all of those people when uh more importantly big respect to all of those aboriginal people who are tuning in we're on aboriginal land uh I want to pay our respects to the dharag the gundagara mob and um probably if we did it better would be saying nalawa midagar getting there the first tune we've got is the first song we've got is uh about an aboriginal woman from tasmania who was a bushranger uh slash freedom fighter uh but her story never really got told too much like so many great aboriginal women in our history a big thanks to uh since tobin who taught me how to count two and I've worked up to three uh and uh there's a little bit of that counting yeah so there's a language warning in this song we slip into doug for a little bit here and then and then there's a little bit of irish too all right so this is black mary black murray took hardback and blade to gather ice design and rock his shoe sold out to cross the naked stone the convict michael house she saw she saw the wilds that caught his back our skin was whiter than the sun he was no spirit he was mine black mary took him to a cave where her convict heeded ways with black potions and a woman's tender hand michael howe was strong again until the time it came to run for the black married chosen she was promised to another's hand black mary and harman went down to the government david's farm though the troopers musket stated songs though the hand's go back to hobart town for around a hole to the government's pledge told the lies damn your eyes if the kid got through with all that history but don't say story's always written yo chick so do so blackmail all right cool uh so I'm gonna do an instrument switch now um and put on my fancy shoes you're gonna move your chair and everything you have a lot of stuff to do actually so maybe we should just repeat thank you very much to blue mountain city council fusion boutique and shelter studios for organizing this fantastic program this is the second lot of I can't say it you practice saying and I can't say love local live it's actually very catchy so I've got these fancy op shop shoes um I'm going to do a little shout out to our north cartoon boy cancer help up shop uh they got me these just lovely yeah just a few yeah you could almost fall out the door and go shopping from here but right now stand home in front of your computers uh yes I was having I mean having some trouser problems and I managed to get that sorted out by the cancer help up shop without a problem at all um in any case enough product placement we're going to do this next song which is uh one I wrote after um always I've always been really in love with uh like uh the the aspect of how the canadians have got a french part of canada and um only was that last week that we had uh um vanessa and dan of piccolo bear who've actually been spending some time in canada which was another good reason to be jealous of canada um but I read this song after kind of thinking about how close it could have been that there could have been like a french colony in tasmania and I'm imagining that the tasmanian people who are originally there first probably wouldn't have been any more impressed however today we would have had for instance uh you know not just fresno peninsula and whole french culture there and uh you know like a quebecois australian so I've written this song using what they do in quebec if you've ever seen jean de coram or one of those bands they do this foot percussion thing with leather shoes so that's why I put shoes on and it's going to feature a few bush tucker things here and there it's a bit of a recipe for like a pie with a stew involved I want to give a bit of a special shout out also while I'm jabbering on to julian joel clement also known as julian castagnaro who's left the blue mountains uh who is our resident one of our many residents there's a few french people here but uh he actually helped me with the writing of this song because I have these guys can actually speak a bit of french we unfair yeah oh yeah see uh but he actually julian helped me kind of work through rather than just relying on uh google translate which is uh not the most it's good yeah who's lived in australia long enough to make it sound just australian as well okay so enough to chat is foreign well done rolling with that oh hello we've got lots of comments oh there's people oh hi people yay hey danae hey max amelia amelia finally came to one of our gigs amelia bought tickets to one of our uh less well patronized gigs but then forgot to turn up but we appreciated the money that she spent on us do we need to talk about this oh I guess I know you can talk about this I'll talk about the next one alrighty so I'm on this uh very safety conscious instrument them pipes have you ever done the bagpipes joke the ill and pipe stroke no it's the only instrument that comes with it with its own seat belt it's the safest instrument there is it's also like when you start playing bagpipes it's a good way to kind of get the social distancing started as well we have a number of covert safe instruments banjo just makes people want to cuddle you that's still in tune isn't it unlike your guitar are you plugged in and unmuted I am I remember that as well hello we want to give a bit of a special shout out to miles who's on the desk there miles you're doing a fabulous job we're only acoustic with the stompbox at the moment well let's stop what there is uh but uh he's been fabulous looking after us thus far I'm hoping it sounds good at home I'm sure it does um we're gonna do a song a tune two tunes one's called blue labyrinth after a little part of the mountains that are kind of really twisty and turny and the tunes kind of twisty and turning actually went camping in the blue labyrinth and tell you guys about that and it was awesome came out again and I managed to manage to get that man he's just especially considering you know there was a hip got out or maybe it ejected me I don't know and after that we're doing another tune which is a tradition called sporting paddy which is where it gets a bit faster foreign I do my oh you foreign all right so I'm going to pass it over to the magnificent jade tinkler to introduce the next two two tunes which she has written and we've got some people oh there's my daughter hey bibs and sharon oh look jeff jones more power to your elbow there's a piping thing and my mother-in-law oh that's beautiful yes lovely and anyway sorry I did say I was going to pass it over to you and then I just started talking like not a great moment ah we are going to play and a couple more tunes on pipes and flute and guitar um these the last set apart from spotting putty which is a traditional irish tune was all written by patty this set jigs jig called bed on the rain which is about an actual bet on the actual rain which kind of didn't turn up in the end but anyway um I think that I won but I'm not sure that that whether there was really any rain was winner on the day yeah and the other one is called mr flag which we've used to do with another trad tune but now we have two of mine and we get to use the extra little bits you want you can talk about them but extra bits there uh like of course I know so many people watch us all the time you will have noticed there is something slightly more fancy about my pipes here I've got these extra little guys here which I made myself I'm just going to interrupt you patty apparently we are also broadcasting live now on blue mountains live rbm 89.1 fm I'll go radio blue mountains thanks brother awesome thank you cool radio blue mountains is an awesome bunch of people so it's great to have them back these little bits here make an extra so now the pipes have got like there's a drone uh which starts this off and then there's this extra little kind of you know noises extra noises that happen that can you know irritate people or charm them as the case maybe in a whole new different way so we're going to start with that so you get to hear that that features at the beginning doesn't it yes let's go uh foreign do do to oh cool I feel like we should do a little shout out to the uh the kelton kelty piping club of australia because we have a gig where we perform that as part of a video conferencing december the 8th apparently yeah so if you want to catch that up and you're into bagpipes and who is not into bagpipes uh november the 8th maybe the 8th I believe celtic piping club australia is that the facebook page where you find the link chelsea piping club online concert of australian bagpipe music of all kinds of bagpipes this kind this kind and the other colors the big ones the little ones the loud ones it's really quite awesome uh yeah so I actually should have used that time when we were spreaking to put this away because we're going to put this guy down to look pretty for a little while and then grab a guitar yeah it is look even I'm being so nice I'm passing it to you even though I told you I was beautiful okay again oh I think so rachel hall I says I love the flute party one thanks rachel the fluke part loves you too all right well it's good rachel hall because you're about to hear a whole bunch more flute as a matter of fact um I'm just gonna have to get myself in tune first otherwise I'll be very cranky well you won't be alone I'll be cranky too all righty I'm gonna introduce your thong and then I'll play my thing do two things now uh we're gonna do a solo flute slow air and irish music slow air is a kind of it's an unusual and cool tradition where you just get one instrument play a piece that's a song but kind of tweaked and made really slow and even more gorgeous uh and that's a song called parting of friends and uh before I do the next one I want to also recognize that how great it is that this is a this is a song related to war uh I think it's really good that in the blue mountains we've actually got a peace memorial wherever you go uh whatever small town you go to there's there's lots of war memorials and and justly so we need to remember uh the horrors of war and not let it forget be forgotten but uh it is also nice uh that we remember peace and we remember those people who had stood up for peace this song is about a guy that the song that follows the flute is about a a les darcy who was he was the um he was like australia's greatest boxer some say and uh unfortunately when world war came well one came along and he refused to take part there's a lot of irish australians and a lot of unionists and a lot of other people didn't actually think that going off to an imperialistic war was such a great idea uh he was unable to fight he was hounded by the press and he was basically sent to an early grave uh so this song goes out to him and all of those people that stand up for what's right and and for what they believe in and also for those people that stand up for peace because we need that uh we start with parting of friends and we'll move into let's darcy food hmm hmm oh please darcy left the farm and went to town he was still a country boy kept two feet on the ground when he strapped his gloves on and stepped into the ring people come save him take a swing please don't see food the best world would sign to get him a goodie sundy punch and then knocked him out climbing hey but he got out horn our drinking gin looking after his family was poor boys I listened was but it was his poor mom's only half to feed her girls and boys when the british chamber went for foolish pride the rich newspapers beat the drum to sample boys takes another kind of face white feathers when your country lies takes one kind of courage charging now and bullets flying the dates now the con to face feathers when your country lies when your country lies around your conscious when your country oh thanks mari we've got a corrected thing for our bagpipe concert oh good job celticpythingclub.com which you can find in the comments on the livestream if you have a look at the comments so the moment everyone's been actually waiting for though is banjo time we've got another flu tune written by do some chit chat about what this one means because we haven't actually explained this one yet to us either particularly well this is a tune called catastrophizing and um I wrote this I think it was the 6th of january this year and we had a different case given the way the rest of 2020 plan panned out I'm not sure that it really was such a good idea to write a tune called catastrophizing something like that yeah so funnily enough being written in early january this tune has a lot to do with bushfires um yeah I'd like to when you've got a banjo and like suddenly arrived you have to talk for ages because you're not really playing a banjo until you spend about 15 minutes tuning I know I can't think of anything else to say what about thank you blue mountain city council for running love local live yeah that's what electronic tuners will do for a man so I did have one more thing to say which was um part of what inspired this tune actually it's more like a tune that came galloping out at somewhere between 11am 11pm and 1am um and one of the things that inspired it was that that really intense liminal space of not knowing whether someone is alive or dead unfortunately I recently found myself in that space again the outcome wasn't quite so good so I would like to dedicate this performance to heather who is sorely missed oh so oh my so all righty this is when you say give it up to jade tinkler and there's no one in the room about the cameraman and he's just not going to clap and though he's doing a fabulous job thank you very much rick did I say I got rick rick I want to give a big shout out to the camera people as well uh they're a really lovely bunch of people here at shelter studios yeah they've really looked after us um rick bruno you guys are awesome miles thank you very much um and also sense very much thank you is it a very big thank you to charity very much to charity thank you very much charity is fabulous we love cherry exactly um and uh fusion boutique keep your eyes open she's starting to pull in some awesome again so that's really good real life music and there's a few kids from kitumba public school and laura public school whose parents have pumped in just to say hello thank you thanks ned say hello to all the foots kylie thank you for your boys uh anyway um yeah well that's going to make me think a bit harder about how I play so yeah no no I've only got one banjo thing left it's all right yeah yeah doing claw hammer style is still a bit new to me so I'm going to find my way through this one um I want to just say also this banjo is brand new so I want to give a big thank you to while I'm at it to uh neil lawday who made it constructed the neck me uh in pieces so I got to feel really clever by putting it together although it was kind of a bit like lego at that point uh but I appreciate it it was like a flat pack thing with the instructions yeah do you have any instructions to follow yeah no was nothing like ikea it was heaps cooler than that uh anyway so yeah so it's a really nice it's made in north kotomba no just south cartoon but just over the travel line sorry we've got that wrong played in north chima right now uh so um this is a song uh about uh the blue mountains uh we've lost a few festivals this year and uh it looks like we may well get the blue mountains music festival back next year little bird told me today oh yeah I feel I really feel for all of those people I've got the hardest job in the world people who organize festivals and uh so a big shout out to those people uh winter magic was one of our first gigs um and I don't think I've you've played the rhododendron festival many times no no no it's a roto review is that part of it yeah I think you have um in any case the rhododendron festival is the oldest festival of its kind in australia and um it has a rhododendron princess now the rhododendron royal family once upon a time it used to be the rhododendron queen and it's my opinion I was actually having a coffee in blacky the other day so a real proper queen walking past and I think we should have a rhododendron queen that's an actual queen like a drag queen and there is a weekend per year that's uh the queen and queen's birthday weekend well yeah okay but I'd like the rhododendron queen to be a queen that's just my little two cents worth yeah I need to combine the two yeah I'm not starting a facebook group about it or anything but that's just the throwaway part of this song uh and it's a love song whilst the bushfires when all righty and I begin it on my own don't_''_2563.44 I yeah you do no pressure we're all waiting for you okay she sat on the tractor a crown on her head katoomba city marching band played dressed in red the trombone and diesel of a delicate thread it was there that I fast caught her eye it was then that I fast caught your eyes the strong men of lithgow or shoveling cold the tools of the roof bolt is wrote on my soul metal oh by fell in a blazing enforno but she fell into my heart but she fell into my heart I fell in love with a roady tangent queen and we danced as the bushfires drove the possums from the trees I fell in love with a rhododendron we do so at the ivanhoe I told her I was a fool we drank wonderburg rum and played 20 cent pool I lifted her gently of the final bar and we danced and we danced is did I'd like you just to give a little bit of a shout at home around your lounge rooms to mr lee burkett on the guitar and the patience okay so that's banjo gone the long suffering oh long suffering lee burkett and uh playing through a wrist injury as well just for the sympathy vote yeah yeah absolutely it's terrible agony speaking of agony we go back to bagpipes again that was a good segment appropriate appropriate so we're going to do another couple of a couple of tunes written by patty these are new ones to us yes most of these have been used actually creativity come out of being stuck at home there was never banjo involved in this band previously yes I mean we've got covet to thank for the banjo you get a bit of love from the people at home about the flute there you've hmm thanks chad's um yeah so there's a little story there's actually a little story about this next you know I think I've told you guys either because it is last one two three chains this one um this one's called there's two chains involved the first one uh is kind of it's got some twisty tiny bits in it and I've named it the woodford benz after two things one the stretch of road which we'll all know that woodford bends which is not that twisty I'm turning it's just kind of like a fun little second ride yeah it's just like this but uh there's also a folk festival woodford folk festival when I'm there's this thing when you go to a festival or go to something awesome yeah yeah so woodford there's also a woodfit in queensland which is slightly more famous um and when you go to a festival and everything's beautiful and fantastic and then you come out it's like coming out of like underwater coral reef or something like that I had an experience playing with festival where I was like stricken by a horrible flu and only the thing that really got me through was far too many pseudo out of the woodford folk festival I just found myself into a terrible all of the borrowed time that I had collapsed on me and I didn't behave very well and it was a little bit like the bends that divers might experience you know all of the things in your bloodstream didn't work out probably anymore and anyway so that was that would for ben's story the other one is the second tune is a tune that I i tried to write a tune in the style in the north part of uh spain and the north of portugal there's a whole uh world of uh of music that's that's kind of quite celtic flavored although they don't I like to call it celtic I don't think but a lot of people on first class they have their own bagpipes they have their own bagpipes and we've got some really good friends that play music from uh that part of the world uh we've you know there's senior senior barolos I want to give a shout out to all the people from the last aura the last oryx who are really good friends of ours and we've done some gigs with those guys uh one of which was in petersham uh and we've also done a fair few gigging at patient bolo so lots of love to that venue uh the petition is where I grew up and it was a very portuguese place and I've I've left there and I don't think I'm ever going to be able to afford to live in petersham again I tip my hat to anyone who's going to work that hardest to be able to pay the rent in petition uh so there's a bit of a farewell to petersham as well in kind of the style of the history and perhaps glyphian slash via petersham maybe a little bit of cultural appropriation but we're not shy of that no no well I grew up you grew up in petersham and my surname connor is a very significant word in portuguese so I kind of feel like I have yeah that's all right we're going to go on to do the wood for ben's after chit chat straight into the water petition man it starts with I think just does that was just me huh do oh do so to too me I think I was doing everything on everything at that point I had elbows and feet and toes and little actually turning into an octopus lady's getting some love on facebook oh it's about time lee got some love back in thank you martin and from your daughter go lee yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's no there's no go mum there's no loyalty guys no they're like I actually want to play guitar ah and so it is all right all right so we are up to I think our very last one one last one and now we're going for time we like it's exactly almost perfect like we're like four and a half minutes before the end all right so don't talk too long well happen by accident let's not jinx having told you not to talk are you going to talk about their instrument oh yeah I'm going to talk yes of course you know me because I like this one um yeah we're allowed to talk about this this been our last one this is also uh a tune that I wrote um I read this on in honor of uh the man that's been teaching me how to make these bagpipes his name is ian mckenzie uh and yes he's a he's a renaissance man he's a man of many talents he can play many instruments and uh he's also been very patiently putting up with me learning how to do a bit of woodturning and instrument making and it's been a lot of fun uh and um also look this is our the last song and this will be the last time I'm actually going to be playing with these two super talented people uh and um so you know there's a little bit of emotion there and in time into instrument making so it's kind of about my personal yoko ono my personal yoko owners are like a seven year old man he's very handsome he has a great book collection too but just don't try and find anything that's part of my job sweep the floor and find stuff in any case uh look uh it's been a great journey and uh we've had a lot of support and um yes I've been very blessed to play with such magnificent people and uh we're gonna go out with a big thank you to kfm to blue mountains city council to shelter studios to fusion boutique and charity

I'll just give it a few minutes until we let everyone into the room they're slowly coming in and can we see them no not at all we can't see how many people are there or yep I can see that but I can't we can't see them okay well I guess it's like I i guess it's a bit like just talking to myself hey you know that makes it a bit easier in some ways they can hear us now okay I will just give it a few more seconds until we let everybody into the room and then we'll introduce our next presenter linda dededevick from local land services greater sydney local land services I'll just just wait a few more seconds yep yep just just letting everyone in it's a little bit of a technical glitch but um yeah we'll let everyone in okay well we might get started so that we don't have to run over time okay so I'd like to introduce our next presenter uh this is linda dedebek she land services and she's going to give us a bit of a discussion today on what we do with our animals in emergencies so thank you very much linda for coming if you have any questions please pop them into the q a box you can put them in at any time during the presentation they don't have to be right at the end they can go in from the beginning if you have something pop up and we'll answer it as we go through the presentation or leave it towards the end thank you very much and over to you linda thanks beck and thank you all for joining me today and I'm going to talk about the animals in emergencies uh just a little bit background um I'm in my day job this is not what I do but in an emergency we respond in in regards to anything relating to animals or agriculture so 63 percent of australian households have pets or animals and we form a very very very strong emotional bond with them to the point that we we do look how cute they are we play with them we engage with them they make us feel happy but what we find in the research is that because this is emotional bond people actually do very risky things during emergencies so people might delay leaving their leaving their house and delay evacuating because they don't know what to do with their animals or they haven't planned for where they're going to take their animals and in other situations people will if they're returning from home and an incident has happened they will come to retrieve their animals and put themselves at risk and others at risk so we are seeing this kind of behavior with our animals also after an emergency and during recovery pets do help people um recover better and as part of resilience um pets are just those things that really keep us going and that's why we see a lot we're starting to see a lot of these resource materials coming out to get that awareness out about planning for animals because it does actually create a little bit more if you want to keep them safe and your household safe so this is question time now and it's up to you whether you want to give me information about who you are but I'd like to know how many animals do you have in your household and what animals do you have if you'd like to pop their answers to those if you wish to answer into the q a box and we can have a look at those who cares liz dog and cat thanks liz one dog I actually have a very large amount of animals I have uh snakes and and lizards and and um chickens and cats and dogs and so I'm not alone in that there's a lot of people across the mountains that have very unusual animals which we need to prepare for yeah and we've got a cat thanks elizabeth so look some households have just one animal some have a dog and a cat two cats some like yourself beck you've got a fair few there you've got a family of animals there so we're looking at you know this is that level of complexity that starts adding to your household and why doesn't my okay I'm going to start just with uh watching a video about how animals behave in an emergency and this is information that comes from vets who understand animals very well will start here in emergency conditions will have a heightened sense of anxiety even the most well-adjusted quietest friendliest cat dog horse when they are in a situation in which they are frightened they are full of adrenaline they will not act in a predictable manner your pet will not do what you expect them to do when they are frightened working with any animal calm and quiet is the only way to approach them as soon as you start getting upset it doesn't matter what animal you've got that you're gonna try and take care of whether it's your dog your cat your bird your horse your goat whatever it is if you're not calm now horses will run away from you or make it hard to catch're not used to it you've got to stay calm to help reduce your anxiety which will in turn reduce your animal's anxiety you would be well served to have made an emergency plan in advance you need to know that plan you need to practice that plan you need to share that plan with others and you also need to build flexibility into that plan as things evolve that will help keep you calm and that will help keep your animals calm yeah people always underestimate how long it takes to get the animals ready it really will go wrong for you if you don't prepare early enough and if you don't practice it it took us weeks to prepare the property and prepare the animals for different situations the animals rely a hundred percent on us to keep them safe I made a commitment to take care of them whether it's fire or flood and they're always at the top of my list so you can see with that video that really does highlight the importance of planning and we're talking risk and stress so I'm going to start with the first question as part of your plan and most people's plans should have the four questions answered that I've got that top right hand corner where how when and what so where you're going to go where you're going to take animals how are you going to get there when are you going to leave and what do you have to prepare and what do you have to take but the question of where is the question that I get asked when I'm talking to the community more than any other question and I think it's because people do understand that you do have a plan sometimes your plan doesn't go according to plan because there are other things that can happen so you want to be able to give yourselves as many options as possible so the most common safe place that people do um plan to go to is family and friends it's the most comfortable place usually um but what if you're the family or the friend to cats and so you may have to have other options like boarding facilities um of course that's going to have to be embedded into your plan as to how long it's going to take you to cat to the boarding facility and then for you to get to your family and friends but be aware with boarding facilities if you're not familiar with them that they do require vaccination papers and that your animal needs to be up to date with vaccination now let's say now give yourselves more options as well because what if you plan to go to your family and that's down in sydney that the great western highway is closed you know to go east and you might have to go west towards lift away or wherever that away so and you don't know anyone that way so it might be good to have look up airbnb and stay's website where they have temporary rentals that I always go to when I'm going down the south coast that's where I go to look for my rental for campsites caravan parks motels that will allow for animals as well and keep these put a list together of these accommodation options and that this though that list could sit in your animal emergency kit for example you may never need to use it but you never know when you may need to use it and of course with larger animals we're talking about maybe adjustment properties that you've got lists of in low-risk areas of course if they've got friends and family or anyone that you know that's got property in low-risk areas that you can take your horses or your alpacas to and then there's always the option about um in regards to evac centers and large animal facilities so I'll talk a little bit more about that speedvac centers are essentially community support through an emerge during an emergency in the blue mountains if there are any evac centers that are open they will accept pets so we don't want people staying at home and not evacuating and putting themselves in their animals at risk because they don't are in an evac centre you are responsible for your pet in both caring for it and providing for it so that's why your animal emergency kit's going to be important to have with you now having said that if you have to flee your home in in a in a stressful situation like that and not be able to take anything evac centers are are set up to be able to support and give any assistance that people do require large animal facilities they're essentially like an evac center but at a showground and they're for horses livestock sheep alpacas goats you name it um just those sort of livestock type animals they're sometimes opened they tend to be opened if it's a significant emergency and we know there's going to be a lot of animals um evacuating and people and and people might get caught out so there needs to be a safe place for those people to bring their animals now their location of event centers they are broadcast by social media websites a council will um broadcast about the large animal facilities local land services on our facebook page that's where you can find that information now evac centers are temporary safe places so uh my message to the community is that your evac center should not be your plan think of it as a fallback option it's there if you need it if something doesn't go according to plan or if you couldn't get to where you wanted to get to or sometimes in as I've as I've experienced in the blue mounds some people will come to an evac center because I don't know how things are going to evolve you know if I started just behind or near their house they've been told to evacuate from rfs they don't know how long it's going to take to get under control and they're there just to sort of gauge and assess the situation but at some point you're going to have to fight you're going to have to have temporary accommodation so that's why having a plan is a much better option for and just as an example you can see some of the photos on this slide so all those floats that you see is at castle hill showground it's was for the flood event this year these people the ones I spoke to and told me about their story were cut off from the flood waters it came very quickly and they couldn't get to the road that they wanted to get to to get to their safe place their family and their friends so they're on the other side of where they wanted to be and hence that's why they came here so it's for people I guess that get caught out don't have a plan all that sort of thing now because it's not comfortable you've got to be with your animal as much as possible some of those people were sleeping in floats so um just bear that in mind but it's there as as a support preparing your animals okay so this is these are some of the things to consider now dogs and cats and horses are requirement in new south wales but in an emergency visual eye identification is really important what if you were separated from your animal you know not the and a person were to find your animal so you you'd want to have those details attached to your animal id tags and collars for dogs cats for horses it's your there are there are different options for horses some people use spray paint and spray the number and the name on the horse um or using livestock marker some people starting to use this thing called things you attach to the main and there's two types there one that you put on a braided on braided main and one that's loose main they are non-flammable and waterproof so they're starting to become better options but it means that someone if they were to find your animal they can't contact you directly preparing your equipment whatever equipment you do use for your animal make sure it's in good clean and good condition and that it's working you know it's um it's not faulty use it's not something you or you or you may use just because now you're going into an emergency situation you might want to put your dog if it's a little temperamental and you know that um it might feel a little bit more secure in a crate but that's totally up to to you as the pet owner if you do use that type of equipment leave it out for your pet to see cats don't most I don't know too many cats are like getting into a carrier so having it out means that they're just familiar with it it's not foreign and um and also you want to practice putting them into it which I'll talk a little bit more about for horses and large animals prepare your float make sure it's in good working order the last thing you want is for something not to like a flat tire on you on your float and um there's no way you can use a flat tire if you if you needed to leave also check that any portable fencing you might take with you as part of preparing for your animals of course your animal emergency kit and practicing your plan which I'll talk a little bit more about but getting closer to an emergency containing animals early is a really key thing to do animals sense they're so intuitive about things that are unusual or things that have that contain danger you know hot days windy days it just doesn't feel right animals are very insured if so perhaps get you getting your cat indoors or even your dog if it does get a little stressed out by you know the environmental conditions outside bring them indoors keep them contained you don't want your cat to hide suddenly and because they can be really hard to get out from under the house or if they're feeling scared so yeah that's that's a really key point that I want to stress moving your animals your larger animals closer to the house as well before leaving is a really good idea the larger animals though the key message is to move and to drop off at their place that they just add a whole another level of complexity so in your emergency animal emergency kit what do you have in it I would think of this as whatever you think you need but also think about the things that you may need so if you are going to family and friends and that all goes according to plan that's great but what if it doesn't think about the things that you might need if you had to go elsewhere um and you didn't know what was in the area let's say you have to go west out lithgow away and assuming that lithgow nothing's happening out lithgow away um you may want to have a spoon can opener and bowls sure you know family and friends I have all that but have those things just in case you may need them it's a great idea to have you can see in the picture there there's a little picture of a cat mario and some details about her and it's just details in facility it could be things about how how they um their medication use um anything about their character that would help someone if they needed to care for your animal if you weren't with them and of course any of those items that you see on that list and anything else that you can think of that would be helpful for you store your kit close or close to where you need to get it um if you had to evacuate your home and anything else that might you can't fit in just in your kit just have it next to it now I don't know if there's anyone that's listening to this talk and if they have a horse I won't go through it in detail as you can see there's a lot more equipment required for a horse so a lot more planning and getting preparation done practicing your plan now this is the how okay it's about your route that you're going to take it's also it's it's putting things into a car it's and if they've done a drill with the whole household but can you if you want a situation and you had 15 minutes can you get everything in the car and everyone packed and the animals etc can you do that in that time that's why doing a drill is absolutely fabulous you prepare your family better it's good to give people roles to play well roles or jobs or tasks to do that will lessen anxiety because they're not thinking about the situation they're thinking about their task what practicing also helps with is preparing animals better now there are nervous animals and cats that don't like getting into carriers so practice it with them you know if you go up to your cafe once a week whatever you put your cat in your carrier take it for a car trip with you just things like that will get them more adjusted to doing it if they had to do it on the day you know whether whether that's relocating so relocating implying that that's you you're limiting early or had to evacuate and practicing the plan well this is a great opportunity to see how what the time it takes the number of trips you may have to take you may think that you can get your three kids your dog and all the equipment you're going to take into the car well have you tested it can you really do that or do you need two trips and if you do need extra trips that's where you're going to change your plan also logistical issues do come up so I was told of a story about a person who practiced luckily they practiced their plan in this situation they put their horse on the float and they accessed they had to go through a very narrow road and that was the road they had to get out of the valley as well through that narrow road and then onto another road to get out of the valley the horse flight was too wide for this road so they were very very they felt very they were glad that they had practiced this because they totally if um that wasn't practiced so it's about improving your plan we have ideas in our heads this is going to work and this is going to be good and you know but until you practice it you don't know that this is often the scenario that I think is probably the most problematic one what if you're not at home but in general this is about potential scenarios the things that you don't plan for what is not we generally put a plan together thinking that everyone's going to be home and this is one of the things that is an issue for the blue mountain city about 60 of people commute off the mountain for work and some of them are long commutes so the possibility of not being at home when an incident happens but your pet is this is something that really needs to be incorporated into your plan um so it could be relying on neighbors I don't know how close you are with your neighbors but there are there have been some meet the street events in neighborhood a lot better and by doing that it's about talking about okay what do you have what what are your needs in an emergency I've got this many cats so I've got this dog and what if I'm not home getting to know people you set up a network and you can rely on each other but it does mean getting to know your neighbours really well and not just next door because it's about options some of your neighbors next door may not be at home too there might be a way on holiday and of course looking at friends and horse community the horse community in various areas in um new south wales have a thing called a buddy system and they need that because and it does work very well um particularly in the act they um they had a situation where the thighs back in and I can't tell you that I don't remember but they didn't they implemented this buddy system and it worked very very well so there are options there but think about potential you're not at home but it could be mechanical issues with your car or your float road closures think of anything that could possibly happen that may not go according to plan and build that into your plan talk it with your family you may need to give yourself lots of contact options have that on a list etc what is starting to what what what one good thing that's come out of covet is that more people are working from home and um for me as part of my working um arrangement with my employer is that I can choose to work from home two days a week now but in the hotter time they are the hottest part of the year so during bushfire season there could be a week where you just get back to hot days and that could be something you could arrange to with your employer your work to be at home and that'll that'll lessen some of the risk so if you've got that option that is a really good thing to have and now this is something situation of course but I have actually spoken to people who have a plan and they were in a situation where they didn't have actually a choice and they actually actually leave their cats behind now I go into how how that happened but we're talking about emergencies we're talking about unpredictable events where yeah these things may happen so if you do need to leave your animals behind for any reason it's probably a good thing just to think anyways part of preparation in the case of a horse in a paddock you know your plan may be to take a horse but it may also be good to actually set up a safe area and paddock in case whatever options you had for getting them out just didn't happen and didn't go according to plan okay so your fresh feed and water for three to seven days is really really key and that could be you know a few backyard chickens that you couldn't take for example um actually eating watermelon there so I'll play that video um so make seven days because this is some you don't know when you're gonna get back home you want it in heat and resistant materials ceramic cement etcetera and don't rely on automatic systems because some power can be out during an emergency if you you may want to keep pets indoors if you need if you need to if but keeping them in separate rooms with feed and water how much time do I have back am I going okay um yeah we've got about two minutes two minutes left well you can look at that but um very quickly if you do have a horse please don't in open up external gates that will actually put your animal at risk because they're on there then they're in traffic potentially could go onto traffic or rfs vehicles and other vehicles may be using um but just open up the internal gates maybe cut some internal fencing that kind of thing and anyway I might go to the next slide but you can read that very very quickly and you can see you can sort would do for your animal if you need to leave them behind and if at the end of all this you you go away and you start thinking about practicing your plan and refining it etc and then you get sort of a bit stuck and you go well um I don't know what to do for this particular scenario if we found ourselves in so if you do need help with your plan talk to your local vet they'll have great ideas rfs get ready week events are great rfs offices have a like a wealth of knowledge and not just about fires meet the street events if you have anything coming up join that there are animal groups on facebook there are animal groups like pony clubs dog training clubs and websites as well and this particular um resource which is the one that I'm holding up that's uh that's a particularly good note um booklet which goes into a little bit more detail than what I've spoken about so and it ah and ask us all those questions you might want they go so quickly it does doesn't it thank you very much linda um is there any questions that anybody would like to ask of linda before we move on to our next session as we've said all of these recordings are available again uh and any of the resources that linda has provided there we can get access to and and send if you have any uh resource questions that you would like to to have answered or if you wish to receive any of the resources um you can contact us through the get ready blue mountains email which we provided earlier so um we can sort that for you looks looks like you might have answered everything linda great um there is a website called the ses get ready animals website at the moment it's it's a quite a comprehensive uh website but we are going to fix it up and um it's going to have a lot more resources and videos um and we hope to get that done by december but we'll do do you send out any information that information to the ses get ready animals uh and a lot of the other information that we've had across the the sessions today is available in our resources uh we will be available in our resources section at the end of the day um so the video links will be able to access that uh information and you can look at those and get that get the links for those different uh organizational links as well all right well thank you very much then linda um I think you must have answered everything it's um yeah you've got no no no questions waiting there so yeah I'd like to thank linda for joining us today and um we will pop out now into the next session um which is susan from blue mountains council she's going to give us a little bit of a talk on on road safety and what to do around emergencies within um the roads road safety side of things so thank you very much I will now jump out of here and go on uh talk to susan and we will see you in the next room
 illegal dumping is happening every day as I speak council is cleaning up one of the many sites that dumping has been reported in the blue mountains it harms our bush lands contaminates our waterways and can impact your family's health and safety and the cost adds up for blue mountains residents too illegal dumping costs households an average of ten dollars per year for clean up costs so I asked some locals would you report someone if you saw them illegally dumping if I saw it happening in the act yeah absolutely no I haven't um I haven't been particularly observant in that area definitely um I don't really know that much about like go to like responsible adult if I knew where it was yeah um I have I don't know first I would tell them to pick it up if they don't pick it up I'll tell the authorities I would but how do you do it I'm glad you asked it's easy to report illegal dumping from your phone or online your report will help us much information as possible so that we can respond appropriately first add a photo if you're able to take one tell us the location what's been dumped and the vehicle number plate or any distinct markings if possible don't worry if you can't answer all the questions just answer what you can and don't forget to leave your contact details in case we need more information we have a mutual responsibility to prevent illegal dumping so we can live work and operate in an environment that is safe and clean you can get more information on how to report online because together we've got it sorted you
All right we'll just give people a bit of time to come in we'll just give it a few more minutes for everybody to make their way into the room all right well we might make a start I'd like to uh introduce um station officer rod kidnap from uh springwood fire and rescue um he is going to talk to us today about home fire safety and what we can do as far as safety visits and things and we can do to prepare ourselves around the home and get ready for um I guess any events that could happen outside of the large events that we've been talking about in terms of bushfire and storms there's plenty of things that can happen around the home and rod's going to be able to fill us in on all of those so thank you very much rod all right so thank you very much for having me back and good morning everybody uh yeah my name is rod kindest station officer at springwood fire station for fire and rescue new south wales and I we start just a little bit about us um so foreign rescue new south wales um we are the state government agency responsible for the provision of fire rescue hazardous materials services in the cities and towns across new south wales we're one of the largest urban foreign rescue services in the in the world and we're the busiest in australia um last year we responded to over 200 000 calls for assistance not only fires hazards materials and rescues but also supporting the rfs ses police and ambulance near south wales so um for us in the blue mountains we have eight fire stations between glenbrook and victoria uh we have 190 firefighters employed by fire rescue in the blue mountains 45 of those opponents at consumer and springwood and we have 145 retained on-call firefighters we have 10 urban pumping appliances for structure fires and we have 10 four-wheel drive water tankers that can be used for water supply or for fighting bushfires in the 2021 fire season uh we we responded to 2400 calls for assistance and blue mountains so what is a safety visit uh we can advise them ways to prepare and improve on the stuff that you already have in place and just look at what's maybe a bit strange around your house that you're not too sure about uh probably as you've heard in other sections that there's over 28 000 occupied premises in the blue mountains 7 000 of those premises are single occupant uh so who could benefit from a fire safety visit uh anybody basically we we tend to concentrate on the elderly or the disabled because they're a higher risk and we do look at our high risk categories but anybody families couples singles that wish to have be more fire aware and more more home fire safety around our home we're willing to come out and see anybody um so when we come to visit your home uh if we're targeting an area and we will do a letterbox drop a week before to say that we're going to be in the area we're going to be door knocking and if you'd like us to come we come around you can also uh call us up and at the end will be details on how to contact us and we can come and see you individually either during the week or on the weekend the visits can be conducted internally or if you don't want us in the house we can talk to you externally currently due to covert of course we're only doing external visits until the 1st of december when we're allowed to start doing internal visits again so uh on the day that when we come to your property um we'll come and knock on the door bring some fire safety information and resources that we need uh two of the crew will usually stay out in the street uh they'll check the hydrants to make sure they're clear and working in your street check on house numbers to make sure they're clear and look at the access to the properties in the area to see what we have um so the first thing we look at is smoke alarms and the risk of fatality in working smoke alarm uh we advise that smoke alarms should be checked every month and replaced every 10 years the battery should be checked every year if they're that stall of uh alarm and they should be changed when required and that's that when you hear that little beeping noise little chirp that tells you that your battery is low uh smoke alarms should be vacuumed probably every six months uh as you can see in the picture there that uh don't climb on ladders to check your alarm just use a broom to press the button and check that it's working uh by law there must be one working smoke alarm on every level uh the the uh picture that you see there has other circles uh if you sleep in a sleeping area you should always have an alarm fitted in those rooms and it's advisable in other areas when we come to visit we carry our 10-year sealed smoke alarms um currently these are the ones we're fitting you're hard to see with the thing um these are mini smoke advise that you should have one we can replace your old ones that are worn out and that's free of charge and that's to anybody that will come and do a visit with okay moving on to the kitchen so a majority of house fires do begin in the kitchen there's a number of reasons for that maybe unattended cooking and of course our our saying is keep looking when cooking don't leave cooking on the stove and walk away especially oil based fires intoxication don't be cooking if you're drunken too much when we're looking around your house and we're looking at the kitchen we'll talk about if you have an extinguisher or fire blankets and we do advise that everybody has a fire blanket and an extinguisher in their home and we'll explain how to use those items properly just in case you're not sure we'll also look at how your kitchen's laid out whether there's anything that we think might be a fire risk and um chemical storage as well because sometimes you we'll look at that sort of stuff moving on to the laundry okay the laundry clean your lint filter after every use we go to a number of fires each year especially during winter that are caused by people not cleaning their link filters so as soon as you take those clothes out drop your lint fills around and clean it out ready to go we also have a look around at chemical storage again make sure it's safe and we'll talk a little bit about electrical safety as well when we're in your house you know especially because it's a wet area moving on to beating so um as you can see the saying there keep a meter from the heater so if you want drying clothes keeping the meter away pets kids put barricades up if you have kids and the blue mountains a lot of people have wood fires and we advise that you clean your wood fire at the start of each season so as we're coming out of winter and people have stopped using them maybe a good time it's ready for next season make sure you burn good quality dry firewood don't burn painted or chemically treated wood we also talk about the outside heaters so leave the outside heaters outside those patio heaters when they're inside can let off carbon monoxide carbon monoxide is an odorless gas and it's a colorless gas and you will not smell it and if you're asleep it excludes oxygen from the blood and unfortunately you may not wake up so just like why we have a smoke detector just to wake you up carbon monoxide with one of those smoothers won't_''_567.76 because it won't set those alarms off okay so some of the other risks around your home power boards um we advise on don't overloading power boards when you've got high power drawer appliances just plug them straight into the wall don't use double adapters on your power boards because that can overheat them as well and cause a fire uh when we go to candles uh should only be used under adult supervision and keep them away from curtains candles when you leave the room or if you go to bed and then wet wheat bags a lot of people use wheat bags for uh for injuries etc make sure you don't overheat your wheat bag make sure it's in good condition before you start using it people do use them to put them in their bed to warm them we advise do not put them in the bed to warm them up because there is a good potential starter fire during due to the heat in those uh inside your bedding uh the other thing is electric blankets they're illustrated blankets once you've used them we've just come out of the cold season we've taken off our beds roll an electric blanket don't fold it hold it crouch folding creates a crease we don't want that we want a roll of the electric blanket when you bring it out for next winter lay it out on the bed turn it on just sitting on top of the bed and that will tell you whether it's working before you actually're at your house and we're going through looking at different things we'll look at escape plans so every room in your house should have two ways of escaping the room one would be the door another would be a window if you can't get out that window obviously it'll be a place that you can call for help from the neighbours or other people we'll sit down and we'll help you design that design that escape plan when you make sure your family gets together and you understand together where the escape escape is we also advise that you find a meeting place outside your house so the letterbox is always a good place to be if everyone's together with letterbox when we arrive we can make sure everybody's together and that no one's missing inside the house all right so if you want to book a safety visit um the phone numbers for our stations are right there in front of you um you can also go on to www.fire.nsw.gov.iu there's a safety visits tab when you click tell you what your nearest fire station is it will also um have a form there if you don't want to call us you can fill the form in it will send an email to the station and then the station will actually give you a call and book a time for safe visits we um as I said before because of covert we're not doing internal safety visits until after the 1st december but we're quite happy to talk to you on the phone about uh about anything around your home and book you in for when when we're allowed to come out and do those things while you're on that website uh we have a lot of home fire safety information on how to keep your house safe there's different sections for the season so we have a spring summer autumn winter campaigns and different things including for those seasons we also we also have recruitment on there um if you've ever been interested in being a part-time firefighter um our retains on call uh you can put your name down they'll contact you and get you to apply and that is a very quick uh rundown on our home fire safety visits uh thank you very much and if there's any questions thanks a lot for that rod it's uh very informative information um if there's any questions please pop them into the q a box and I will be able to assess getting them answered by rod uh a lot of the information that's been getting presented across the the day today will also be included in that resources book that I was discussing in in the back in our last session looks like you might have answered everything really well there rod because it doesn't seem to be any questions coming through well that's good and again all of these sessions will be video recorded and will be accessible through your ticket so if you wish to have a look at them later on you can do that also we have one question come through um are the fire safety visits available across sydney uh yes they are and uh every safety visits and when you go on the fire and rescue new south wales website which I'll go back to it okay just see it when you go into fire.nsw.gov.au you can put your address in and it'll send it to whatever the nearest fire station so if you live in ryde it'll send it to ryde fire station or parramatta and they can come out and they unit houses doesn't matter they'll come out and do a safety visit as any property we've got another one here um how long will the recession recordings be available after today okay well yes this the session recordings um at this point are available sort of infinitely there hasn't been a time frame put on them so you will have at least a couple of weeks to put them to access them um through that that link that you've you'll be supplied afterwards with the email okay and I think I think that sounds about it so thank you very much uh rod for coming along and uh thank you very much everyone asked as we said before if there's anything else that you'd like to to have the um answers for just send us an email um and I can forward those to the relevant uh organizations to access the the questions to be answered so thanks again rod um and we will pop out now for the next session I think we've got a a little bit of time between now and then so again if you need to have a break or anything in between sessions uh feel free to pop out and have a bit of a break and we will see you in the next room thank you very much
When doing renovations on your house or business it's often the first time that you think about what to do with your waste that doesn't go in your household bins so I've come to the resource recovery and waste management facility to get some advice this place is huge what kind of waste do you take in here we've got a lot of services to safely dispose of hazardous waste and that's because not a lot of people realize it but there are some things that are really dangerous in your household bin so for example paints oils fluoroglobes fire extinguishers and batteries can all be brought here to the community recycling centre and it's free and then you run council clean out events yeah so for more hazardous things like herbicides pesticides cleaning chemicals and poisons you should bring those in on one of our free chemical clean out events which are scheduled throughout the year and you can use the waste app to check out those dates right yeah that's right and then for safe disposal of asbestos make a booking safety conditions so check the website and make sure you're doing it right and it costs the same as any waste going to landfill so there's no excuse not to do the right thing but remember to check out the website and the app so you bring the right waste to the right place because together we've got it sorted
Am I waiting for you back are you ready yeah yeah I'm just going to let a few more people come in okay um and then we'll kick off okay so we'll kick off I'd just like to introduce andrew k blue mountains real fire service district office community engagement coordinator um andrew's going to have a chat to us today about what we can do to get ready and be prepared for bushfires within the blue mountains if you have any questions you'd like to ask andrew she'd like to pop them into the q a box at the bottom and I will monitor those for andrew and he can answer them as we go along or I'll leave them to the end of the meeting at to the end of the session okay take it away andrew thanks beck good morning everyone as mentioned andrew kaseman I'm the community engagement coordinator for the blue mountains district office of the new south wales rural fire service um and I'm looking forward to hopefully giving you a lot of information as pete touched on already let's do a little snapshot about blue mountains and what we have so we have 23 brigades in the blue mountains going from glenbrook clapston west to victoria north to bell and then east to mount toma of those brigades 22 are firefighting brigades and one is a support brigade we have around 59 firefighting appliances so they range from bulk water carriers to the large category 1 tankers that you see on the street down to the smaller strike striker class or the cat 9 land cruisers that we have carries for 450 liters of water so across the mountains 59 firefighting appliances and we have around two and a half thousand volunteers let's see what that's uh what what we're covering off here so we've got 32 000 private dwellings in the blue mountains there's around 80 000 residents and 5 400 registered businesses so I guess being prepared is the answer here we need to if you do the math uh 595 fighting appliances 32 000 private dwellings it's pretty impossible to put a fire are scattered as mentioned across the blue mountains that we're ready for short-run fires when it comes to a campaign fire obviously we're calling our resources from neighbouring brigades neighboring districts I should say so we have the capacity we have 75 000 volunteers across the state we are the largest volunteer firefighting force in the world um but obviously that takes time to get here so being prepared is the answer in this space let's reflect on what we experienced last so we had uh busch grass and forest fires those numbers were well down on the season before thank goodness uh approximately 70 incidents occurred through that fire season and none really of consequence I'm pleased to say outside of the fire season we managed to get a number of hazard hazard reductions away of note there was lyndon creek bull's camp and mitchell's pass now we're working towards getting as many um hazard reductions as we can uh completed um the issues around um our workload in that space is the weather potentially there's there was a guesstimate at weather where we can get these hazard reductions away but we are working towards it what do we have coming up in the fire season ahead of us so from the pre-season briefing the following notes given to me the weather outlook is wet through november so what does that mean that means we're going to have warmer nights and cooler days that also means west of the great dividing range there will be higher grass and crop fuel loads because they're receiving significant rainfall as we know it rains things grow but as the as the rains dissipate and the sun shines the weather gets warmer we're going to end up with significant um grass fires and potential great across the west of the great dwelling range and of course we are still restricted with covert 19 and that will influence the way we operate and how we um how we respond to events planned and unplanned but how do we prepare for the bushfire season as a resident well you need to have a bushfire survival plan these are available at the district office these online so if you want to get a bushfire survival plan get your mobile phones out now because there's the qr code alternatively you can go to my fire plane put my fire plan into your search engine and you can find it and you can do it online on your phone it's very simple it's very easy to complete it's vital that you do and you communicate the bushfy survival plan with your family so the idea is that you will sit with your your household and have a conversation around what does the bushfire what does it look like if we are impacted by a bushfire do we leave if we leave early where do we go what do we take who do we tell how do we get there if we're going to stay and defend do we have all the necessary resources that we need mental physical um to to defend our property from a bushfire so if you've snapped that code great otherwise um it'll be in the presentation anyway preparing for bushfire is is easier than you trees and shrubs keep them away from your home obviously keep your lawns and gardens mowed clear around your house remove anything flammable from around your home and clear gutters I mean that's obviously a memory slide for all of us in the blue mountains is once we think about bushfires we think about clearing our gutters and um you know in that incident where you uh may not have an opportunity to to leave early have um you know hoses that can reach around your home make sure you have a reliable source of water um and of course the last line of defense when it comes to um preparing for bush fire is insurance so consider your insurance options and and take them up if you can you also need to be aware of the bushfire danger meter and the fire danger ratings now these signs exist along the great western highway along bells liner road and they give you the daily effectively the daily fire danger rating and you need to understand or at least get a picture of what you should do depending on where points so you know severe extreme and catastrophic catastrophic is all bets are off you need to leave the mountains you need to be prepared for um significant foot and fire in the area extreme severe very high high and low moderate so we'll never even if it was uh even if we had 20 ml of rain over the next four days we would never say that there's zero chance of a bushfire because you know we have lightning strikes and they start fires as well another way of being informed is the app the fires near me app is a great tool to have and the the way it was originally rolled out was that it would have all the information that we have about fires in in the in the state um now you can actually set a parameter around that where you are so you can basically gps locate your home and then you can say you know I would like to be informed about fires that are 10 kilometers away 15 kilometers away up to 50 70 kilometers away then you can set will actually ping to you to advise you that there is a fire in your area a great tool a great way to remain informed and once you go into that space you'll see a number of alerts so once you see that there's a bushfire there will be an alert symbol next to that so that alert symbol these have changed now um so they are we're actually now um I guess if you like lockstep with the rest of australia now so this is a national warning system the three three warning levels are advice watch an act and an emergency warning so understanding that those symbols have changed and obviously understanding what they mean is pretty important as well so in the preparation of your property trimming trees mowing lawns moving flammables if you need help help is at hand so uh we have the ada program um it's available to residents who are infirm disabled or elderly and require assistance preparing their property for bushfire it's no charge to you it's a one-off um uh program um and should you give us a call the phone number is there 874 149 4955 you can find us also on the website what will happen is an assassin will come out have a look at the works that need to be done and they'll make arrangements for a number of people to come to your home and do all of those things that will take you home from an undefendable space to a defendable space as mentioned it's a one-off free service the idea there is that once we have your home prepared to uh to a defendable space if you put a couple of dollars aside each week fortnight months when we roll into the next fire season it may just be that you need to pay someone just to come and clear the gutters or just trim a couple of branches so it won't be as significant a workload as as we've already undertaken to get your property to that to that level of defendability um the rural fire service um has a number of ad campaigns we've just completed the last one um it new one and the new one is um live bush fire ready we're still sticking with the same slogan and prepare act survive but it's now the campaign is around um leave bushfire ready and as mentioned before there is an increased risk of grass fires this season so I mean we need to be aware of that because um fire behavior in in grasslands is different to fiber behavior in forest um so fire behaviour in grasslands is very very fast-moving so our mindsets um needs to be um tuned into that as well and let's be honest there are still patches of large patches of the blue mountains that were untouched after the 1920 black summer fires so it just takes a lightning strike somewhere that may uh um create a bushfire for us but uh obviously fingers crossed it doesn't happen so if I may and hopefully this will work I will play you the new ad um that the rfs has just rolled out you may have already seen it but we'll all watch it together now yeah oh I went to work here we go there's something about living here the sky's the change right before your eyes and people that look out for each other a community that doesn't plan and prepare to keep everyone safe because is just a part of life here we've been through it before and we'll get through it again so um I think that the theme behind this ad campaign is that we've we've done the preparation we've done a plan we have an understanding of bushfires with us and now what we're trying to do is learn to live with it if you like and then what is it that we need to do and embed in ourselves that we do every pre-season to prepare for fire um so that's pretty much my presentation I am incredibly quick it's only been 15 minutes or so so I'm open to any questions if you have any or bec if you if there are any questions that come in on the q a please let me know yeah no there's nothing any questions that anybody would like to ask andrew please feel free to put them into the q a box at the bottom there and we'll address them in the time that we have doesn't look like it looks like you've done a really good presentation there andrew doesn't seem like anyone has any any questions for you at all outstanding well um and obviously if you do have further questions um beck's got the email address that you can um you can write to um you can also um oh there is one in the q a yep I was just about to say we've just had one come through um are there any resources available for non-elderly people or residents to assess risk etc um to assess risk you can reach out to your local brigade and have a conversation with them brigade members are always happy to come to you to your home and to give you some advice around uh what it is that you might may need to do to prepare um they won't necessarily assist you in removing that tree or removing those bushes or or whatever or whatever it is that you need to do to prepare for bushfire season I think that's I think that's it and yeah does that does that answer your question I hope so but I was going to say that the rfs website has a an abundance of information it'll inform you so the fires near me app for example is information on your phone if you if you log into our website you can actually get all the information as well um live into your computer or laptop and there's a raft of information around what you need to do to prepare your home to prepare yourself considerations around pets considerations around if you're traveling um you know what is it that you need to to do if you're traveling through a bushfire area and a fire starts um whether it's four-wheel drive or camping or bush walking so there's lots of information there to have you and your family your friends prepare for the bushfire season that's coming and be a very mild season we do have another one here andrew what do you do if your neighbours are resistant to getting ready um I guess uh you know we live in a democratic society people can choose to do what they want to do if you're in a position where you truly believe that there is a significant bushfire threat um that's not necessarily states a neighbor let's say you're you're about national parks or council land and it's a bit overgrown or whatever you can reach out to the district office and we can take what's called a hazard complaint and assess the bushfire risk against the environmental assessment code now that will look for a significant bush fire risk however you know a a tree in a neighbor's yard will never effectively be deemed as a significant bushfire risk but it is in your mind in a residence mind my first port of call is to have a conversation with your neighbor to see if you can get them to maybe they need assistance maybe you can help guidance um or maybe you know their english may not be their first language they may be new to the area and not have an understanding a strong understanding of what being bushfire prepared is so uh my first instinct would be to suggest that you speak to your neighbour try to have that conversation because uh let's face it if you do uh lodge has a complaint whilst your information is confidential we do notify notify the complainant that there is a complaint been lodged against them and we are going to do an assessment and that may lead to you know 20 years of that neighbor never wanting to speak to you again so um I know it's a it's it's a it's a it's a tender way to step but my first instinct is to honestly suggest try talking to the neighbor first well that looks like all the questions um yeah that doesn't seem to be any more coming through so I guess we can finish up a little bit early uh and if we want to go and next session um feel free to run out and grab a cuppa um we will have the next session open and ready to go at 10 45 which is about 10 minutes so we'll give you 10 minutes break to go and have a grab a cup of coffee thank you very much andrew any any other questions as andrew said you can contact the district office or send them through to the get ready blue mountains um email address and we'll we'll send them on to andrew and get them addressed for you so thank you very much for your attendance and uh we'll see you back in the next room thank you thank you
 many people love to see the beautiful brightly colored crayfish in our blue mountain streams but few people know how long-lived they are or how important they are for the health of the streams people see the crayfish in our streams and call them yabbies yavI's actually refers to a different species and is actually invasive in the blue mountains the two species that are native are what's called spiny crayfish so especially on the claw you'll see some spines on the native species a yabby is totally smooth they're different to yabbies because they grow much more slowly and live for much longer and only one in a thousand will will survive until maturity help us to help the crayfish and get involved with blue mountain's crayfish count you
Uh it's very easy to to focus on bushfire it's it's a clear and ever present hazard but there are a lot of other things that uh that can go wrong here so um I shall move on okay so just a quick overview of um emergency management in new south wales so um the context of of this is the definition of emergency being an incident that endangers lives property or infrastructure and requires a significant and coordinated response so that is essentially uh many agencies working together towards a common goal so obviously you can think about our major bushfires definitely fit that category some of our major storm events where we've got many agencies working together under the lead of a single agency um yeah that's the context in which we are working obviously uh you know there are other things that occur uh you know say your hot water service uh going out maybe an emergency for you but not an emergency in in this context so and then to address what we have to do to to plan and prepare at state regional and local level and their key functions among some others are to identify assess and plan for the range of hazards that may impact their area of responsibility a couple of other key emergency management principles is that all of our planning considers all the different types of hazards that we might encounter and involves all agencies and those are important principles because again uh you know it's not just bushfires that we're going to experience here in the blue mountains we also have severe storms uh we may have say major transport accidents that that impact our community and of course we involve all agencies because there are many people that contribute to emergency management they all have different perspectives uh they're all contributing to a broad planning process the other key principle that we work to is the comprehensive approach so this talks about all these different aspects of emergency management so prevention preparedness response and recovery sometimes this is this is uh referred to as a continuum but obviously there are some things here that go on continuously so uh trying we can obviously we can't we can't prevent a storm and largely can't prevent bushfires but there are some things the technological hazards that we are exposed to um that maybe there's some things we can do there and we always want to be prepared um response really in terms of this diagram if you drew it to scale would probably be the one percent uh you know responses is generally you know short and sharp uh and and uh these other phases uh where most of our energy goes and of course recovery which is picking up the pieces after an event has occurred and assisting a community to return to its uh post-disaster level of function I spoke before about emergency management committees so we have a local emergency management committee here in the blue mountains as does every local government area in new south wales and you can see here the breadth of agencies that are involved in in these planning processes so blue mountain city council provides chairperson councils across new south wales fulfill that role we have the local emergency operations area commander and an interesting point about that is when they're fulfilling that role they're actually not uh working for the police anymore they they step into a different a different space so the police are separately represented there you can see our emergency service organizations some state government departments that provide uh services in key functions so disaster welfare health services animal and agricultural services make important contributions to to planning and preparedness and then we have another suite of agencies who are defined as observers but they also make a valuable contribution so key land managers statutory firefighting authorities npws water new south wales utility providers transport for new south wales we also because we have uh raph glenbrook here in the blue mountains we have the australian defense force uh and ref reference representatives and uh some linkages into the community services sector through mcrn so one of the key things that the lemc is required to do is actually to complete a local emergency risk assessment so this is the basis for all of our planning around uh managing emergency uh incidents in in that we identify what can happen in the local area uh we consider the the probability of those things occurring and the impacts uh when they do occur uh that leads to assignment of a risk rating and then that risk rating uh as per the standard process if it is of moderate or above so the risk ratings are low moderate high and extreme uh that if if it is moderate or above then we need to give that hazard more consideration in the local emergency management plan so in terms of the outputs of that process and I've picked the top six here from that local emergency risk assessment so these are in no particular risk order um actually the the the events are actually listed in alphabetical order uh but you can see here that there are quite a few things that that uh are an extreme risk for us uh bushfire obviously heatwave uh people underestimate heat waves they're actually quite complex uh events with with multiple impacts uh and obviously they won't just affect the blue mountains in isolation but an extreme 19 pandemic we had we had identified a a pandemic as an extreme risk but again this this is uh something that goes beyond the blue mountains lga to to a regional national and global level uh severe storms are an extreme risk for us uh transport accidents obviously we have some very significant transport corridors that go through the blue mountains so again extreme risk there and and obviously there's there's 30 000 dwellings as well as other commercial industrial buildings in the blue mountains so the risk of structural fire uh impacting any of those premises is being rated as a high risk and just hold hold those uh six things in your mind because uh that will probably uh appear as a theme through the sessions throughout the day again in terms of what we do at in the local emergency management plan in addressing these hazards what what lemc's are asked to do is prepare consequence management guides now unfortunately these are defined as restricted operational information so they're not openly published to the community but basically it just uh identifies triggers bit of an aid memoir for the for the local emergency operations controller when they're they are coordinating overall operations uh and then just breaking it down into uh roles and responsibilities of key agencies uh in the response phase of an incident so another key principle here is that at the state emergency management plan identifies combat agencies that's the term that is used but essentially they are the lead agency for each type of hazard in new south wales so the combat agencies are tasked with developing hazard specific plans so there is a a sub plan for each uh major type of hazard uh at state level so there is a state storm plan there is a state bushfire plan uh you know there is a state pandemic plan um so the combat agencies are responsible for develop developing those um they're also responsible for leading community engagement in in relation to those hazards and obviously coordination of emergency response when when something occurs so when we look at uh combat agencies across the hazards that I mentioned before so in relation to a and rescue new south wales because we have two fire services here in new south wales uh there is a big red line on a map that actually defines uh the responsibility between the two agencies but largely if you can think of uh you know out in the national park is largely the rfs area and in close to the urban zone is fire and rescue new south wales in relation to heatwave this one's slightly different in terms of there isn't a single agency that is responsible for that it's actually coordinated by the state emergency operations control of the sea con because as I said before heat waves are very complex in terms of their impacts and when we start to think about managing the consequences of a heat wave there are many many agencies doing many different things and so it is called coordinated at a higher level uh pandemic as as we would have seen over the last couple of years is coordinated by new south wales health uh severe storms the combat agency is the ses uh and when we talk here in the blue mountains generally above about 800 meters elevation we will see snow from time to time and that's actually dealt with under the uh various storm plans uh structure fires again um probably in the blue mountains mostly in fine rescue new south wales domain but also there are some areas in the rural fire district so it can also be led by the rfs and transport accidents again we're not talking about you know a you know three-car nose to tail at traffic lights here we are talking about a major incident uh let's pick a train derailment at linden where the carriages come off the track and impact on the great western highway uh that that is a under the management of the local emergency operations controller obviously because there are multiple uh you know agencies involved and considerations that need to be made and I suppose just to be clear uh obviously blue mountain city council is leading uh and facilitating uh this expo today um so I guess just to be clear on what what the role of local government not emergency responders we're not an emergency service so we don't uh lead or coordinate any aspect of emergency response but we do support uh emergency services and other organizations when when major incidents occur our key role is to provide executive support to the local emergency management committee and to facilitate all the related uh planning and preparedness activities that the committee undertakes and the other thing there is is we do have a significant role in supporting disaster recovery and and these are roles and responsibilities that are specified at state level obviously council is also the manager of a substantial amount of land and infrastructure uh as I said before we provide emergency support services so we we have a significant uh involvement in that preparedness space around uh preparing uh our land so we have a significant fire mitigation program that occurs on council land so that uh you know that land is prepared for the the uh occurrence of a bushfire and minimising impacts on on neighbours where we can and also as an organisation being prepared to provide these support services to said when we have a need to implement a formal recovery process uh councils often provide a local recovery manager and a team of support staff largely administrative to to assist in that process when we have a really significant incident basically the state will will appoint a recovery coordinator uh separate to council but council will still be uh heavily involved in supporting that recovery process so um stepping up a couple of levels of governance here um it's important to note that we have a national strategy for disaster resilience uh that that covers a range of um uh subjects in terms of you know how we as a nation can be better prepared for national natural disasters and one of the key principles and I guess one of the the main drivers for this event today is the notion of shared responsibility so everything that I've spoken to uh you know up to this point you know is really about uh largely about government uh and and what uh the various levels of government do to to be prepared and respond to uh like major uh there is a finite uh number of fire trucks finite number of police cars and there may be circumstances as we've seen over the last couple of years with with floods with uh land slips with bushfires that there are times where our resources just can't keep up with the the incident at hand so it is it is absolutely critical that that people uh you know our community uh understand their risk plan accordingly uh and are reasonably self-sufficient so that uh you know whilst the the emergency services catch up uh and and find their way into affected communities that that people um you know can largely be self-sufficient so yeah this is a really critical part of uh having a well-prepared and resilient community so I guess now you know starting to think about um yourself as an individual so I'm not going to answer these questions for you uh I think it's really important again in in this context of shared responsibility uh that you have start to think about this for yourself around what are the hazards that you as know your day-to-day routines what are the hazards that you might be exposed to uh you know there's a few there that you know going back to that emergency risk assessment uh that you can probably pick from that list uh they're certainly the uh the top tier of risks that we see in the mountains but there might be others um so have a think about about uh ways that you might be affected by disaster um and also how might those disasters affect you uh you know is it going to be a bushfire impacting your home is it going to be flash flooding coming through your front door and flooding your house there could be a range of ways in which these events impact you personally uh I guess a question for you is where are you actually going to go to find relevant information about these hazards and how to be well prepared and uh obviously you know this this uh forum today uh will will hopefully answer some of these questions for you for you and particularly around uh you know who can I guess just an example here about sources of information so blue mountain city council has uh an interactive mapping portal available via its website and whilst that's largely around uh town planning land use planning that there are some hazard related uh layers that you can put on there so having a look here the the uh the orange yellow and red uh mapping that you see here is our bushfire prone land mapping now just a word of caution on that is that the bushfire prone land mapping is a trigger for consideration of of building standards when you are building a house or doing a substantial renovation the bushfire prone land mapping does not tell you anything about your level of risk other than uh you may be affected by a bushfire at some point in time so just bear that in mind the other the other mapping that is sort of in the centre of this image is actually uh flood flood-prone land now you wouldn't think that here in the mountains we have a big issue with flood we certainly don't have floodplain but we do have significant issues with flash flooding during our peak rainfall events and particularly where the drainage systems become overwhelmed and we start to get overland flow so you can see here this is actually a part of hazelbrook and there are some places there north of the great western highway that when we have significant flash flooding uh that that it can and does impact on on private property uh generally for for short periods of time but uh you can bring up some of that information via our council website um just noting that that this information only exists where flood studies have been undertaken and it is not a comprehensive overview of flood risk in the mountains uh but this is just one avenue of investigation in terms of identifying your your risks so again you know looking looking to the various agencies uh again similar theme to what we saw earlier here around planning and preparedness information so if you're wanting information around bushfire survival planning obviously rfs are the key agency there extreme heat is actually largely when it comes down and so there is information on the health website to assist you in being prepared for that uh pandemic obviously new south wales health ses for storms fire and rescue new south wales for home fire safety and transport for new south wales the lead agency in traffic safety but noting that uh at a local level uh councils also play a significant role in in communication of road safety uh information just a couple of other things uh to note around um your risk and and being prepared is that the impacts of a disaster may not just be physical um I've heard it described that even people who are not uh you know don't lose a house or or have damage to their property that that being in the midst of a disaster can be one of the most stressful things that that you will ever ever experience so I guess uh being psychologically prepared um as well as physically prepared is is quite crucial now I guess it's sometimes hard to visualize what you're going to experience but at least start that thought of of uh being in a particularly severe storm and and um yeah we've seen some instances recently uh where not only have we had gigantic hail and and uh you know torrential rain associated with thunderstorms you've actually had tornado activity uh and I dare say that being in the middle of a tornado would be a rather scary experience um I don't know whether you can ever be prepared for that but just be be aware that these things can happen and the other thing here is uh I guess just assessing your support networks um there is pretty good evidence building that that people who have good connections to family friends and neighbors uh you know just as part of their social network uh fare much better during disaster events than those people who are isolated so if you don't have good local connections in terms of if you don't know your neighbours and and you know you don't have uh friends or family in the near vicinity is thinking about well how do I build better connections because these things and look so I'm really at the end of my presentation here uh probably got a few minutes for for q a but obviously the intent of this event today is really to help you get ready that disasters can occur at any time obviously some types of disasters are seasonal so bushfires strongly correlated with with the uh spring and summer period here in the blue mountains uh severe storms again spring and summer but uh there are some other other types of events that may happen at any time of the year so we really want our communities to be well informed uh and and try and be disaster ready at all times so that's really it for me um look as big mentioned at the uh at the outset that if if you do have questions uh that we can't answer here in the next couple of minutes uh we have an email address get ready bluemountains at bmcc.nsw and we'll take those as questions on notice and try and get back to you uh in the next uh you know a few me while I just navigate the q a here okay so I've got a question here is there specific disaster information and advice on the bm city council website okay so um we we do have uh pretty uh minimal uh disaster related information on the website at the moment but uh but a key project that we're working on really uh you know beck's lead on this is the delivery of a disaster dashboard so this is an emerging concept uh in emergency management and uh very much led by councils uh but on behalf of all agencies of of their respective local emergency management committees and uh unfortunately we were unable to to have the product go live for this event today but in the next couple of weeks hopefully uh it'll be up and running which is is really essentially a common operating picture with with uh information drawn from a range of sources uh and presented in a centralized location with regards to incidents that are occurring now and access to information on all of the hazards that we've spoken about uh where you can get more information about about being prepared so that will be coming online hopefully in the next couple of weeks and again council will do some broad comms on that uh once that information goes live I've got another question here can I confirm the link to the risk map so probably the easiest thing there is to to just do a web search for bmcc interactive maps and uh our website has an awful lot of information packed into it given the breadth of services that the council provides and so navigating your way through the actual website itself from the home page can be a little bit tricky uh I i tend to even myself as an employee of council I just do a web search um and and hopefully it'll come up as as the top result uh and then it'll take you through to that particular portal thanks a lot for that pete um so do we have any other questions or is there any anything else that we we can um I guess provide you your answers with the coming days if you think of anything as pete said just send it through to the get ready blue mountains email address and we'll address those questions for you we will be going into the bushfire ready presentation very very shortly that is being kindly presented to us by andrew k from blue mountain blue mountains real fire service district office um he's the community engagement coordinator there so if there isn't any more questions I might open the lobby up for the next session and we'll see you all in there thank you very much
I came out here in um in 81 within five days I understood I wanted to make australia home and it's taken until 2020 to actually be a citizen I felt so much a part of the country it didn't really feel necessary though it cost me voting yeah very very happy it feels like I've come home to make the ceremony very great thank you
Hi I'm tanya and I'm michelle we are at complex time headquarters and we thought it would be nice to introduce ourselves so you can put a face to a name behind the scenes here we help to get the bins and caddies to you we update the have your say page and welcome new people which got us thinking about what promotion we could do next year we know that ads in the local newspaper really helps to generate lots of interest so we will definitely do more of that and social media is a great way to connect with different people and promote the program more broadly but before we launch into 2022 we thought it would be really good to check out checking with you about your experience of complex time and if you're able to continue with it or not the survey only takes a few minutes and will show us how we can improve the program speaking of improving I found a better concourse story can we hear it sure okay the worm said to his buddy hey all that food has that's great
I'm Elizabeth sadly best Oh Blue Mountain City Council's principal Landscape Architect and I'm here to tell you about I prayed to the plate fitment here at Summerhays Park point of the great used to make this playground more inclusive we've chosen Summerhays Park because when Malaya area has many children and some of these Park has a lot going for it already it has the playground it has the courts to ride on the ovals to run on it has a good park car park well away from the busy road but it still likes a few things that could make it attractive to the whole community you know certain sorts of place of amenity and this is where you come in we're looking for people to help us work out what to do here we're gonna hold a workshop September the children with additional needs in their carries to help understand what we really can do is hard from that we'll put together some plans and I'll put those out to the broader community we review the inclusivity of the can I get there I'll hear it Summerhays Park it's obvious that one of the first things we need to do is make a connection from the car park through to the playground and around the playground to some degree and we may need to do some other things too which we hope you can tell us the second question we asked is can I play and while there is a range of play equipment here it's not a very wide range it's not suitable to a wide range of people so we look to do some maybe social play since we play other things which game and the final question is can I stay and that's about amenity about not needing to go a home straightaway shade seating possibly a toilet again questions we need the community to help us with so if you're interested in helping please go to blue mountains have your say stations on a Hayes path and they just do your English thank you
 the blue mountains is an incredible place I look around and I can see why so many people love to live in this world heritage area I've been lucky to meet so many locals and their respect and love for the mountains has shone through that's why it's so important that we do this right nowhere is protected from the challenges of hazardous waste but the blue mountains community is up for the challenge families businesses council we all have a part to play in protecting our communities and our ecosystems together we all have a responsibility to protect this special place together we've got it sorted you
If deciding between your red yellow and green bins is a challenge at times then how many people actually know what hazardous waste is and how we dispose of it safely so I hit the streets to ask people what don't you put the household bins oh I reckon the battery this one if you washed it out maybe you could go in the recycling I don't know about the light though do you feel confident knowing what bin to put everything in oh sometimes it depends what products uh so yeah but no it's sometimes it's a little bit tricky maybe not really no definitely neither of these say this one I'd say mostly but not always yeah I i don't know that one doesn't go in either serious I know it's like don't put me in the bin ah good to know do you need some more help some of the most common household items that need to be treated as hazardous waste and not go in the household bins are batteries of all shapes and sizes gas bottles smoke detectors fluoro globes and tubes and chemicals from the house in the garden but this isn't a complete list so to make sure you're doing the right thing for our environment go to the url or download the bmcc waste app together
Approximately one-third of australian homes contain asbestos products if your house was built before the 1990s it's likely that it'll have some asbestos-containing materials and here in the beautiful blue mountains a lot of our homes were built when asbestos was commonly used so before renovating it's really important to carry out precautions to make sure that you your family and your neighbours stay safe so let's go meet claire who's planning some renovations ever since I've moved in here I've dreamed of turning that old shed into a home office at the moment I'm working on my kitchen table and it's just getting really crowded in there so it would be lovely to have some more space daniel do you know what asbestos is um not really no I think I've heard of it before but I'm not 100 sure what it is to be honest I don't have that excuse I do know what asbestos is but um I haven't even factored it into the thinking around this project in considering this new information does'll obviously have to look at how to get it removed safely and so it'll have to be done properly and obviously cost will be a factor well you might be pleasantly surprised to find out that depending on the amount of asbestos disposing of it safely can cost the same as regular waste not great but it's still really important to do your own research and you can find out more information on the link below daniel do you have anything you'd like to say about hazardous waste together we've got it sorted
I'm karaoke yeahyeah
What's Up What's Up
 I have fought I have lost I have loved I have given in god and I have walked I have ran cut my hands and went on and still you wonder how to get into my heart when it's broken when it's tired tired

how to get into my heart when it's broken when it's tired tired and lost hello everyone out there we're eagle and the wolf hi aren't we yes we are and uh we're here presented by blue mountains city council in partnership with fusion boutique and shelter studios so thanks for having us all of those people who are amazingly talented and lovely I know and we don't have to do any of that stuff they're doing it all for us and all we have to do is sing which is very can I tell you another interesting fact yes all previous streams can also still be viewed on the fusion boutique presents facebook page really under the live all the videos tab that is really really good to know so if you like the vibe there was there was some beautiful artists yep a couple of weeks ago as well and you can go and look at them too yeah yeah but we're eager on the wolf we're going to spend a bit of time with everyone tonight so um hope you enjoy it uh our next song is called uh two lovers this is a new song um coming out on our second record that we're recording at the moment so stop holding so tightly sunlight should be may you find yourself in fields of wild flowers two lovers take their time they don't worry about what's left behind two lovers are on their way home come here let go off your leaves left and full stand here right with me we'll hold on for more may we find ourselves on the highest blue mountain two lovers take their time they don't worry about what's left behind to lovers around their way home to lovers two lovers take their time they don't worry about what's left behind two lovers on their way home two lovers are on their way home our next song is called these nights and this is one of the first songs that we wrote together um oh like six seven years ago now almost yeah um and it was a little bit of a we were writing a bunch of songs weren't we but this was starting to write a bunch of songs this was the other first I think it happened like you wrote half of the lovely night with our guitars and you know all in that and then you I think your old stinky cat did finished the song yes I finished up the little chorus I think yeah and that's usually how I like to work now yes um I'll just get a really good idea and then I just go I've had this really good idea and then I'll just get a bit bored with it and I'll give it to chris and you and then you say yeah that'll do that's the sort of the why yeah yeah pretty right now it doesn't really matter because the chorus is written amazing chorus so can you just do a bit of filling in bit of blah blah blah yeah yeah but that's yeah it's happened the other way around too it has yeah but you know not quite as often this one goes out to um jenkins the cat breast in peace oh jenkins I forgot the song now I'm thinking about jenkins they wrote this song it's got these nights when I dream of my lover and I wander around all alone and I'll wait for the day I can't see him and calling my own and I let all the sadness out slowly and I know all the things I should do and I wanna dive deep into her arms I don't wanna listen to you I don't wanna listen to you I can't get through these nights I can't get through these days I don't know what to think I don't know what to say I can't get through these nights I can't get through these days and I lit all the don't always know the I just know she makes it all right I just know she makes it all right I can't get through these nights I can't get through these days I don't know what to think to say I can't get through these nights I can't get through these days I can't get through these nights I can't to think I don't know what to say I can't get through these nights I can't get through these days so nice bit of socials oh a bit of socials flashing it's trying to make it a bit I like trying to make it really effective I saw clap clap clap oh eagle wolf and cat that's true cause we tell a story about a cat oh lucy thanks beautiful lucy for tuning in hope you're all tucked up in bed oh all the way from melbourne mandy masters oh thank you oh sarah jane thank you beautiful harmonies I do like singing that's so nice stephanie knight said so beautiful amazing voice to me yeah I think I think that was for you I don't think so I do oh mum she mum tried I don't think what is that oh she's probably run out of data again oh no I tried I love you what a sad message what did you try try mom needs to go down to the servo and put some more's very kind very nice we'll just read these all night shall we yeah that's lovely thank you guys we love hearing from you probably the best band in the world oh no I just said that thanks guys oh okay um we're gonna do a johnny cash song now um I love I love this one glasses we're old now yeah I am old you might see when I'm um doing anything I start to do little eye vibes because I'm just one eye yeah I've got one bad worse the eye yeah so I do that which means I'm not like trying to wink at you there's nothing sus going on no it's a funny eye yep so you get funny when you get old yet funny eyes and a funny back and funny knees yep funny everything yeah funny everything yeah um so sarah usually says no glasses when I'm playing because it take it sort of dials the vibe back a little well that's not completely true it's just it reflects the light eyes it's 50 50. it's casting vote nick

I'm Rob McCullough and I'm here in the beautiful Blue Mountains of New South Wales Australia and I'm working with Blue Mountains Council researching the freshwater crayfish in their local creeks and streams and today we're researching this one a giant spiny crayfish you asticus spinner fur now this is a female she's got eggs and the eggs look like buried so consequently we call these a buried female now spiny crayfish are keystone species they produce each of these females produce literally hundreds of young each year and these young don't normally make it to adult size but what they do is they provide the food source for all the other creatures that live along this stream so the eels and the turtles and the platypus and the water rats and the Shaggs and the herons and the lizards and the snakes everything eats baby crayfish so they are incredibly important to the whole eco ecology of this Creek
Holly what are you wearing mate isn't this what I'm supposed to wear no this site's been cleared of asbestos otherwise you wouldn't be here ah come on in I'll tell you all about it so how does it affect you dealing with asbestos you know these days information is freely available to us when managing asbestos you just have to follow the process on every job and so when do you first start thinking about asbestos when you're doing a renault when I'm at the beginning of a job I look to consult the asbestos register first and if there isn't one available I engage an independent licensed asbestos assessor now we'll identify all the asbestos that may be affected by the renovation I have to look out for my crew and my clients a lot of houses do have asbestos but if it's under 10 square meters I can remove it myself because I trained in identification safe handling and suitable control measures for asbestos and acm I follow the guidelines whilst wearing ppe and rpe to waste facility in blackstone it costs me the same and it costs my clients the same so I've done the right thing and what if there is more than 10 square metres I just factor in the time and the price to get a licensed asbestos removalist and remember all the information you need is online so check it out because together we've got it sorted you
 hi I'm kerry welcome to build a mind today we're going to do a short session on coding with scratch scratch is a fantastic platform for your kids to learn how to code it was created by mrt specifically to teach young children to use computers to get into coding and one of the most wonderful things about it is it's a community so there are people out there actively taking an interest in your children's learning and growth it is monitored very very strictly and allows our children to go and see what other kids are doing and how they've actually created their code coding is a really important skill for our kids to learn it brings in all the 21st century skills that are in great demand right now things like collaboration creativity problem solving main thing that it does is brings together all of our steam subjects such as science technology engineering arts and maths and it puts them all together in one place and gives our kids the opportunity to be super creative gives them the opportunity rather to just actually go ahead and create their own games so as an example I'm just going to step into a very simple game that's one of the first types of games that we have kids creating and we have kids as young as five creating code for a game such as this in this particular game we have three characters we have our main character which is our plant part we have a character that is our characters are known as sprite and our character over here is a watering pan that our plant is trying to get to to get water every time he touches the watering can he'll get a point however if the plant is touched by the kangaroo here's our enemy he will lose a point this is what our code looks like let's have a look at the inside of it when our code first starts it hasn't trigger to actually start off the game which is usually pressing on the green flag so the starting point you can see over here is this little block where it says when tells my plant pot where he's going to start off at the beginning of the game these little sections tell me when I click on my left arrow I want you to move left when I click on my right arrow I want you to move right and up and down next block of code which is the most complicated looking code which is really quite simple just says that if you touch the watering can get a point if the kangaroo touches you lose a point each character is given its own instructions much like I would tell one person a specific set of instructions and another person a different set of instructions so our kangaroo if I click on my kangaroo he has his own set of instructions it's got some very simple code all it says is when I first start my game so when my green flag is clicked I want you to constantly move down the screen if you get to the bottom of the screen I then want you to go back to the top of the screen but not in the position from left to right and continue to fall down the screen that way my plant never knows where the kangaroo is coming from and it makes the game a little bit more exciting because he has to try and avoid it and our last character which is our watering can again very simple then it just says when my green flags click so when my game starts I want you to constantly move around the screen to random positions stay there for three seconds and then go to another position that way again my main character never knows where it's going to be so it puts a little bit of excitement into the game while the character has to run around trying to get to the watering can so that's very simple example of scratch and action at buildermind we teach kids to code by creating games and we teach them from four years all the way up to the end of their high school life and we take them from drag and drop coding through to pure text-based coding and it's really really important for everything that we see and do we offer after-school programs school holiday programs private lessons and we even teach coding at birthday parties so come along and join us

 what people think custodians his place at south of it's very keen to keep the health of the country and we do that by looking after the areas this once will hold water and keep our waterways running clean and that that's our job we're supposed to manage the country and keep the healthy and alive for the next generation love that we've got a lot of help the project was funded by the New South Wales environmental trust we're actually working on remediating and recovering over 30 swamps across the noonas plateau and blue mountains plateaux and as a result it has to be a huge collaborative project with lots of different partners all working together we have central tablelands local Land Services who manage the program on the Noons plateau shrub swamp and Blue Mountain City Council which managed the program on Blue Mountain swamps we have a variety of other partners such as the forestry cooperation community groups such as swamp Care National Parks and Wildlife Service and researchers as well who are carrying out research on the giant dragonfly standing here in broad swamp which is the the jewel in the crown of the news Basharat swamps this is a real education swamp for us it's an opportunity to show people what a good intact swap system looks like I'm standing right in the middle of a population of threatened Dean's Boronia it occurs probably in about five or six swamps on the news but oh so the mutants played a shrub swamp below itself it forms part of an I suppose a temperate swamps on sandstone vegetation type it's different to the Blue Mountains in tends to be a bit more trouble and certain species including the deans brownie are only grown here these swamp systems essentially sit right up the top of the catchments they tended in sort of broad and flat they act like a big sponge in the landscape so water comes in sits in these systems and slightly released out into the bowl and they really help to purify them and a really really essential in terms of so here we are in a typical Blue Mountain swamp it but they also provide us with a range of really important services which we call ecosystem services the other thing that they do is obviously they're fed by groundwater and they're often constantly wet to there a future for a lot of species when things start to dry out like the drought conditions we're currently experiencing and you'll find the birds and animals flocking in to the swamps to take advantage of this constantly so in these areas so they're really important our ecosystems not only for the threatened species that we find in them but also for these really important ecosystem services providers and there's just no way if we tried to recreate this is an engineered man-made environment doing those same services for us would be spending 10 and probably we're also working with the community through the swamp care and Bush care program and there's been tens of thousands of volunteer hours that have been put towards addressing the weed issues that have been impacting on spirits and I've certainly encourage any of you who are interested in a lot of work to be done in a virtual culture we are part of the country so the health of everything contributing to elderly like I say that's our job now job is to look after but just ourselves with the rest of the creatures here and we do that by looking after you
Hi everyone my name is kerry and we're here at buildermind to learn about stop-motion animation and stop-motion is what we call a filming technique and it's all about making something that's inanimate like a lego man can't move on his own without somebody else interacting with him and we're going to make him look like he's moving and the things around him look like they're moving by using this technique so we're going to take lots of photos when you're doing stop motion it's something that takes a lot of time and focus so you want to be in an area where you're not going to be easily distracted by things going on around you that you've got some quiet that you can focus you're wearing comfortable clothes and you've got room to move around nice and easily the first thing that you're going to do is start to outline your storage so you're going to use a storyboard to do that you're going to draw some pictures really simple stick figure once we've done our storyboard we want to start preparing our sets so we need to gather all the things that we need the first thing we need is a base plate or something for your scene to occur on it needs to be pretty small and everything that we do is going to happen on this one area you might have a few surrounding bits behind it what I like to do is put my scene inside of a box so that I block out the rest of the room and all I see is what I've actually got in that particular area we're going to start by gathering all our props together and you may already have built them like I have done once I've got all my props I'm going to start to put them in place and I don't want to put things too close together so that I can put the focus on the main characters if you find that you don't want to use a base plate and you want to use a smooth surface you can's it that's my main scene once my scene set up I've got to start to get my equipment prepared and you can use multiple cameras or you might just use one you can use something fancy like a dslr just your basic average mobile phone will do the job some people prefer action cameras so it really doesn't matter what you use the idea is just that you whatever you use you keep it still once we have our camera ready we're going to look at lighting it's best if you are in a room that has lots of natural light if that isn't an option for you you may want to have multiple lights to try and avoid shadows lights are also used to create an atmosphere so if there's a dark or scary moment you want the lights to be off and you want things to be dark but if it's a happy light kind of mood you want things really bright you don't need fancy lighting you can just buy ikea lights as I have or you big lights or you can go out and get a softbox which gives you a really nice even lighting across your set I'm going to use an ipad to take my photos with and the great thing about the ipad is that I can do all of my filming in one place and I don't necessarily have to move it over to a computer to do my editing so I'm going to put my ipad in place and I'm going to line it up so that I'm only getting the parts that I want to see in my shot take a little bit of time to get this part right because you don't want to have the background showing once I've got my ipad in place I'm going to draw little lines where it's seated just so that if I need to change the angle of the camera I know where to bring my ipad back to afterwards now we're going to start to take our shots we're going to make sure that our characters are where we want do the movement effects your background is probably going to stay pretty static and you only want to move the parts that have the main focus for me that's my villagers I'm going to move my figures around there's a technique that's called ease in and ease out this gives us the most kind of realistic motion that we can get we want to do slow movements as the movement starts bigger movements and then slow movements again as the movement's coming to an end okay so we're going to start off with some basic movements but if you think about how you move and even watching somebody talking their hands might move their head might tilt that's the kind of thing that we want to get happening here so as I've got my first scene set up I'm going to take a shot I like to hold my ipad in place because it's really easy to get movement and just take a shot now I'm going to move my characters ever so slightly and you're looking for her arm back a little bit I'm tilting her head this character might just move back a bit and this one's head might tilt so they they're really small motions that you're making and I hold my ipad let it focus and take another shot I'm going to move two or three really tiny movements and then some bigger ones as part of my ease and ease out so she's going to turn her head back a little bit her hand starts to come down this one's hand starts to come down and she's turning a little bit more and I take another shot you can see the kind of time that's involved in the movements we have to make to get a simple scene you're looking at probably 30 to 40 photos she's gonna move a little bit more these are still me easing in so they're still very small movements and I take another shot I might have them coming in a little bit closer as the conversation is getting more involved now I'm going small tiny little movements that are barely noticeable once I've taken my scene I'm going to go back and review it so that I can do some mana editing in the middle of it so I go back to the beginning of my film and I just play the scenes out to see what it looks like so that's stop motion animation in a nutshell if you want to learn more about special effects great techniques that you can use to get more realistic motion we've got sound effects we've got smoke plumes come and join us at build a month in our after school classes holiday workshops or private lessons hi girls hi betty have you heard about the thing in the bushes what thing they were talking about a monster in the bushes what was that I don't know what do you mean there's nothing in the bushes let me see oh it's a puppy
Pope's Glenn bushland reserved Nestle's on the edge of the Blue Mountains National Park near the township of Blackheath New South Wales this is the story of how a weed infested wasteland was transformed into a thriving wetland Polk's Glen Creek is a permanent stream that rises in soldiers Memorial Park beside the blackheath pool it flows through the blackheath caravan park and into the newly created Popes Glen wetland a thriving community of wetland and riparian plants and home to large numbers of birds and frogs only a few kilometres downstream the creek flows into the Blue Mountains National Park and World Heritage Area and tumbles over the escarpment into the spectacular gross valley from here it joins the grocery veut and eventually becomes part of the Hawks greener pian river system this means the health of this small urban stream and surrounding bushland has important consequences due to the town's topography much of the runoff from the surrounding residential area ends up in Pope's Glen Creek hard surfaces caused dramatic spikes in flow during rain carrying debris and silt into the creek this thanks to 16 years of work by the volunteers of the Popes Glen Bush Care Group with practical support from Blue Mountain City Council and funding from the state government of New South Wales the former wasteland has been transformed the valley used to be a forest of enormous willows with a dense understory of other weeds like privet blackberry and ivy over many years rain had carried large quantities of silt from roadways which were not surfaced until 1996 this resulted in a large silk flat that became a home for the weeds the group began poisoning the Willows a few at a time to prevent the erosion of the silt flat this dead willow labeled 6a is being felled and here the stumps ten years later surrounded by flowering Leptis berman from above the felled willows look like dead spiders their limbs were left on site for later use to help create the wetland as we're about to see at the same time as the willows and other weeds were being progressively removed volunteers worked to plant thousands of seedlings grown up from seeds collected survive in this hostile environment the plastic guards protecting them from environmental extremes including Wallabies snow and Sun today many of these plantings have grown to be indistinguishable from native Bush across the silt flat native wetland species such as gar Nia Carrick's and Junkers are thriving overlooking the valley floor the understory now includes a healthy mix of hay Kia Bougherra acacia and tea tree species plus many more Pope's Glen Creek used to be a single stream cutting a channel through the valley in order to reduce erosion of the creek banks and to provide water for the new plantings the volunteer group undertook several strategies to disperse the flow across the silt flat after several failed efforts by the volunteers themselves contractors were engaged to create a weir across the creek including a diversion channel to split the flow during storm events storm water carries silt from roadways into a newly created sedimentation pond where it can be removed this pond overflows across the wetland supporting the vegetation and visiting ducks to help spread the overflow dispersion cells were built gum boots are now obligatory willows were also put to good use these barely visible stakes show how quickly the wetland vegetation regenerates the whole group got engaged in this soft engineering work and again the site recovered quickly the local herons are happy if not the yuppies to deal with potential channeling and erosion from storm water the group invented ripple beds by piling up smaller sticks during heavy rain water now flows evenly across the wetland flattening the vegetation which protects the surface of the silt flat from erosion where the silt flattens a vulnerable cliff needed to be stabilized this was done by a team of contractors who began with 20 tons of rocks to build a causeway what we see today is nicknamed the ark but before it was hidden under rehabilitated vegetation it looked like this an enormous structure designed to protect the silt cliff built out of railway sleepers that were carried in by hand during heavy rain the causeway and the Ark create a waterfall while still stabilizing the silt wall behind the overflow from the Ark rejoins the creek to manage the excess waste from the filled decomposition on site these became part of the landscape and proved to be important habitat for small birds returning to the wetland to support the bird population after the debris piles compost down the group embarked on a program of dense thicket planting during community planting days about a thousand seedlings were planted in three locations these plantings quickly grew into dense thickets like this one and are regularly visited by many species other foreigner enjoying the wetland include frogs the striped marsh frog is a regular resident of the sedimentation pond while this emerald spotted tree frog calls from nearby habitats dragonflies and mayflies are indicators of the health of the wetland without the group's carefully recorded photo history it would be hard to remember the highly degraded wasteland that the Pope's Glen Bush Care Group has transformed the success of this ambitious rehabilitation project is celebrated on these three interpretive signs erected at the headwaters of Pope's Glen Creek you
 g'day I'm pan I work for farmer forward and the littleton stores cooperative and today I'm going to show you how to make some micro greens all right why would you want to grow microgreens you ask they're super dense in nutrients and minerals and they're great in your salads we can grow these on a kitchen bench so what you want to start with is your compost this is our compost from about 50 meters over there we've sifted out a lot of the big bits and now we're left with this nice soil perfect for propagating seeds I'm just going to make a thin layer on the bottom of our empty tray nice and thin layer less than an inch even it out pea seeds take a handful and spread them out they can be kind of dense not too dense it's not a strict science all right I think that'll do then we take a anything flat really I suppose this block of wood is my weapon of choice we just press them in get them grow up so big and strong nice all in there nice tight snug happy then we want to water them once just a light sprinkle also they germinate and don't keep them in direct sunlight keep them in a nice shady place they should stay moist but just keep an eye on it if it starts to dry up maybe give it another little sprinkle of water and then in 10 days you should have something like this these little guys poking a little heads out and then if you're really lucky these are our three week old micro greens some already harvested some about to be super simple to be easy just scissors bowl perfect for salads all right there's a little bowl of micro greens perfect for salads super high nutrients keep the whole family happy and taste good in your tummy with farmer forward we send this produce to littleton stores primarily and you can pick it up from there fresh produce you can join us on thursdays at 9 30 a.m if you want to get involved in farming forward and learn some everyone's really friendly and it's our favorite part of the project for sure so if you want to come along that'd be awesome
 can you tell us one thing you did in the program we did a lot of fun stuff like such as go down multiple bushes around the area we went to blue gum swamp and then we also went to down the back of our high school and we did lots of like soil testings and taking photos I drew leaves and ferns and up close when you looked at the third you can see a little hairs on it so I drew like the details on it I did a lot of water testing in the different locations we went to and all the swampy areas we tested the pH of the water and that in turn told us if creatures could live in the water like small insects tadpoles dragonfly larvae what did you like doing the most I enjoyed being able to get out and around in the bush and learn a lot about the surroundings and the places that we have her in the area it was very interesting to know what was outside well I like the most is probably the Tori and also and then like the nature around us the thing I find the most interesting about birds the feathers that they're really colorful and somewhat gotta prove one of my most memorable words probably eating the bush tucker like such as sarsaparilla leaves and everything but you got to watch out because I have a poisonous sometimes but I also really enjoyed building a little Hut in the bush how's it different from being in the classroom I think I can learn better outside the classroom because there's more visual appeal and less words to take in you can just have a photogenic memory and basically snapshot a flower or a bug or an ant well I like this more than being in classroom because you can get out so I use up all your energy and relax me teammates learn a lot of stuff about the nature like and what's in around you pretty much and yeah it's just a load of fun it's a lot better doing science outside than inside because you have more room and more stuff to test I find doing it than sitting down writing stuff down would you encourage other people to do this I think that this is an amazing course for learning about your surroundings and to help with making new friends and connections with nature I would recommend it for getting out in the bush more often because you can learn so much stuff about your surroundings and how much trees change the more deeper you go what's so special about bush I went really high well the bushland heel is one of it kinda really it's very rare to find it in the back of the school and it's really big too but there are a lot of creatures Hill and if someone destroyed this place we'd never be able to get it back and a lot of animals would lose their homes and we need to protect them I've really enjoyed working with the kids in the connecting kids with nature program I think it's really important for students to work with outside organizations such as the council so that their learning is connected to real-life problems how special our bushes around when early high school and kids haven't always had an understanding of the different types of vegetation and the soil and what makes this place special and now they have a much better understanding of that they've learnt about lots of different species about the different types of eucalypts that we have here and that's why we're world heritage so that's really important we've learnt about the different types of soil and vegetation but they've also just had a lot of fun it's great to see how calm and happy the kids are in the bush and how much it brings us joy and I think that's really important to enhance their learning and well-being at school
 this is a hollow log I've savaged it from a fireplace because they are extremely valuable homologs take hundreds of years to form and their valuable habitat for many of australia's animals hi I'm tom and I'm from hooked on nature and I run nomadic nature safaris tours across the blue mountains such as the blue mountains glow and tour and I'm all about habitat habitat for all sorts of wildlife now what I'm going to create today is a frog hotel frog hotels are basically mimicking that high log I just showed you so all we need are some vessels that are watertight I'm going to use some gravel some beautiful native plants such as this junkis and I'm going to build a humble a boat that's going to house lots of different frogs so starting off all I'm going to use is some gravel put that gravel down in the pot and today I'm going to use a junkers so squeeze that in here so this juncus is a native plant they're really really robust a bit of drying out if you forget to water it and they look beautiful place that down in the center now I've put the gravel in the bottom of this pot because it's going to be a water reservoir but it's not going to be habitat for mosquitoes because nobody wants mosquitoes around their home okay they're right in the center time for the hook to come off junkis is a really robust plant so I'm not too concerned about flattening these roots out eventually they're going to grow through the gravel and really secure this hotel together all right add a few more pebbles you could use some sort of fired clay aggregate all sorts of stuff you just want something that's quite heavy to hold everything in place this frog hotel I'm using the schmancy pot bit of bling so I'm going to go with the natural balance effect and use some bamboo what we're really trying to do with these frog dorms is mimic that hollow log so it's a nice tight space that the and secure you can stay humid and they're very comfortable and they'll choose to live here so all that I'm going to do is place the bamboo around in whatever pattern you choose get the kids involved get really creative eventually this junkist will grow all way through this and now I'll get some pointing mix that's a bit of that organic matter which is going to allow this plant to grow these are great in courtyards now to help secure it a little bit more I'm going to put a layer of pebbles quite happy with that put this in a little courtyard a big backyard the beauty of habitat like this is it can go into the easiest spots and why do you want this habitat in your garden I run these workshops about habitat creation because it's really important we have wildlife around our homes frogs that are going to come to this such as parents tree frogs bleating tree frogs blue mountains tree frogs and more are beautiful allies they do a good job of snovelling up a great job on pollinating my snow peas and so much more so what I'm going to do now is carry this out later on I'll fill this with water not above the rocks underneath so it's really nice and moist I'll put a bit of water down into the bamboo and within no time the frogs be moving into there and croaking their magic
My name's Monique Forestier and I live in the Blue Mountains I've been climbing for over 20 years the reason why I love it here is because I have the wilderness on my doorstep and I can go off bush walking or climbing with my friends at any time I spend a lot of time hanging around on the cliff faces and I've just recently found out that there are five really rare species of plants that also spend their time hanging around on the cliff faces of the upper blue mountains some of these are so rare that they only exist in this part of the world and for some there are only a few of them left we're making a series of micro videos telling the stories of these amazing plants and why they're so special please keep your eyes out on social media and share them around with your friends I'm Michael Henson and I'm environmental scientist for Blue Mountain City Council today we're going to be talking about the dwarf mountain pine a rare and endangered pine that escarpment the terminal falls in Kitumba for a distance of nine kilometers only 755 individuals have been recorded it is a Gondwana age plant that occurred at the time that the dinosaurs were roaming Australia and it has persisted in these areas because it lives in the spra zones of the waterfalls where the waterfall spray acts like a fire blanket the dwarf mountain pine grows very slowly and it's got very low reproductive success it's very vulnerable to damage weeds coming down from the upper catchment poor water quality and bits of it break off readily if it's touched or or disturbed so it's very important that people recognize this plant and are very careful conducting their activities around my name's Dana I'm the nursery major at the Blue Mountains Botanic Gardens and it's been an amazing opportunity for me to have a look at these plants out in the wild and seeing these natural habitats with so many endemic species in a Blue Mountains itself so this is Leonie Malak nice it's a really special plant it's endangered the wild can grow up to two metres high it's only found in a few places here at katoomba and Blackheath to the untrained eye alien email looks like all the other blue mounds and shrubs I thought flowers with its distinctive yellow flower heads you won't find this plant next to any forms walking trucks but you may accidentally damaged it scrambling to a lookout or after a climb and just walking along the cliff top because this plan is so difficult to recognize we're just asking people to stick to the path and please don't pick any flowers or the plant itself enjoy the great outdoors hello I'm Linda Sullivan I've been in the Blue Mountains for over 30 years and I just love this environment this is the Packers Hamiltonian there's not many of them and they only grow in three creeks sub catchments all of which flow into the grocery of the valley of the upper blue mountains the plant is quite small it has flowers but only between August and December it grows in these specialized niches where's very vulnerable to being trampled by Kenyans and Bush walkers and the groundwater can be affected by pollution which can come from the towns like that Keith that can affect it watch where you sit watch where you climb it is a special plant and appreciate it particularly when it's flowering hello my name's after Henry I'm arranged with National Parks and Wildlife Service and Fraser bowed any eyes it's a tiny little planet it's a very rare plane and there's only about 60 of them in existence it's really really hard to find you can see it's that it blends into all the other plants in this area and it's really really hard to survive when it flowers it's this beautiful little bundle of movi pink flowers and it's quite beautiful it only occurs halfway up the cliffs in these clay stone bands bushfires can readily cure this plant people that walk along here see the flowers it's beautiful they pick it rock climbers would potentially step on it and damage it so we're's got really beautiful flowers when it's flowering there but don't take them with you whatever you do you could be affecting this species for survival g'day_:_297.78 I'm Greg Bourke from the Blue Mountains Botanic Garden on below the cliff line here at black Heath and above me is the Fletcher's drumstick an amazing plant with an origin that dates back to the time of Gondwana it was a time when the climate was warmer and much wetter now it's dried out and these plants are restricted to just a few areas along the cliff lines and in moist areas the plant itself when it's not in flower it looks like just about any other plant along the cliff lines here it has unusual white flowers on the ends of long stalks which look a bit like drumsticks there are only about 200 individuals left in the wild and the main site for this species is here at governs lead when you're out here in the bush abseiling bush walking or climbing you might not realize that any footsteps off the main when out in the bush and treat every plant like it's the last

 g'day I'm tom and I run hooked on nature and the blue mountains glow on tours now today we're here at glenbook lagoon and I'm going to take you on a safari and show you how you can meet the local biodiversity that lives all around our urban areas the best thing I love doing is getting out at night and seeing what wildlife is all out there so all this basic kit I use to have a great safari so I always take a spray bottle plastic cup a spoon a glove a clear plastic container binoculars are always essential and a trusty bug landbrook lagoon in any water body is the perfect spot when you're doing a nature safari see everything needs water and I get to this place down here and I bring the binoculars and right now there's a floating turtle island out there it's been man-made council's installed it all for the purpose of saving the sydney basin shortness and the long-necked turtle nests because they've been eaten by foxes so on our island they can see a masked lapwing or a plumber and it's got babies how great is that so come to the water body make sure you bring your binoculars and you're going to make some great discoveries so there's a beautiful purple swamp pen over there I love these birds they're a native and it's sitting in the rushes and I've just watched it use its big feet to pull up the rush and eat the starchy base underneath they're a really beautiful bird and they're an australian native should be lucky to know that they're here now you might not think there's much life here but in this little patch of grass it absolutely teams with little animals so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bug net so all I do is I'll get my bug net and I simply run it through the grass just like so now I stick to grass very deliberately by doing it in the grass I'm less likely to encounter things like paper wasps and different little insects now when I first get the net I just have a quick look in there make sure there's no honeybees and wasps if there were any all I simply do is pop it at arm's length and let them take off so I'm just going to pop it in the little clear plastic jar look at this it's absolutely team the life you know in that small area there are so many different insects you know things like the flies and the native bees and wasps they're beautiful pollinators some of them control pests all those little spiders they're filtering out mosquitoes it's all part of the cycle of life and it's what helps to keep the lagoon nice and healthy it's time to go and let them go so on this bushy little melaleuca here and all the little shrubs around the area quite often they're peppered with little spiders webs might be dangerous spiders spiders that are your hour because they're filtering out mosquitoes to find them all I do is I get bush just look through the air and I should illuminate any webs that are on there ah there's one little one there hey look down here what a little jam I can see a tiny little jumping spider she's not dangerous but she is great at hunting mosquitoes I'm just gonna leave her alone so I've got some rotting logs down here and any kind of form on log or rocks in the ground a beautiful habitat beautiful habitat frogs marsupials insects reptiles so much more now I'm going to roll it over and see what's underneath now very carefully I lift it up I make sure there's nothing under there that can hurt me such as a snake or a spider and I lift it towards myself that way if there is I can simply carefully place it back down oh look at this I've got a little millipede now what I'm going to do just so I don't hurt it I've got a plastic cup I'm going to pop it in from close investigation and afterward back down and the beauty of insects like this they're eating the logs they're eating the leaf litter so they're reducing the fire risk they're a good thing to have around and they make soil now you wouldn't have thought in the tiny space that we've been with the simple bit of equipment how much life we've discovered all you need to do is you've got to get our india reserves into your parks into the bush into nature and just listen look and you discover life I love it I get out here I drag kids on bug out birthday parties and safaris I look in the beautiful canyons at glow worms doing blue mountains glam tours there's a lot of life to be discovered wait till it gets dark when the torch has come out there's even more
So I'm out here in one of our beautiful swamps looking for a giant dragonfly they're like the wedge ATAR the Eagles of the insect world you don't want to be an insect out here they have almost 360 degrees vision and all four wings operate independently so super stealthy they're also threatened species much like the Tasmanian tiger was before it became extinct and threatened species Day is coming up and on the 8th of September the Blue Mountains cultural center will be having free entry into one of their exhibits and you can come and be inspired about our bush and about what you can do if you can't make it on the day you can always come along to one of our bush care groups or Bush care events that happen throughout the year all of which help to improve habitat and increase diversity and it's pretty nice spending a few hours outside what will you do you

In this second tutorial we're looking at facebook and instagram advertising for businesses and organizations in the blue mountains of new south wales welcome to my video so in the previous lesson we created a covid 19 post using facebook's official coveted 19 feature and then we pinned the post to the top of our facebook page um in the meantime I just quickly went in added an image to say yes we're open just to make it look a little bit brighter images sometimes help sometimes they don't but in this case I chose to go with that in this video I want you to go to facebook.com ads slash manager we're going to create an ad and we're going to send that kovit 19 pinned post out to more people so they know more about the hours that you're open any special conditions that you have any special bundles or packages or home delivery or something like that facebook.com ads slash manager and then uh where the nine dots are up there go to audiences and we're going to create saved audience so that we can then apply it to an ad so click saved audience the audience a name bm for blue mountains family local something like that I'm going to say people who do live here I'm going to choose katoomba and then I will just let me zoom that out a little bit drop that down probably take that from 25 miles yours should be in kilometers um I do deal with american companies I don't want just katoomba I'm I want to let people in around the area know so maybe within um 17 miles that takes us down to spring wood that's fine because it's for family I can change this a little bit and say I know 22 to immediate family so mum and dad and kids to maybe I know 46 you choose and then I would say parent here once I've clicked parent I choose suggestions that button there and I say parenting and family and I can also choose the age of the kids so if it's a child care that you all parents will do once I've done that I create the saved audience and don't forget the saved audience is called bm I'll say blue mountains family local create saved audience now that the audience is saved I can use it in different places so I'm going to go to facebook.com ads manager again and this time instead of going into the business tools I just make sure I'm on the ads manager I'm going to say create campaign so there's campaign there's create and that's an old one now if you're in real estate hr recruitment bank or credit union or if you're a politician you have to choose the special campaign but because all I want to do is boost the kovit 19 post I'm just going to leave it as it is and choose engagement engagement just means I want more people to see that particular post I'm not sending them to my website I'm not asking them to download an app or view a video I just want them to see that so I click engagement I'm going to choose post engagement and I'm going to say existing post july 2020 because it's when we created it click continue I've already created the audience so I'm going to use my saved audience and it was called blue mountains family local we already saved it and then I'll choose manual placements and just to see where it possibly could appear so I'm going to boost this post I'm going to take an existing post and send it out but I can choose whether it goes out on facebook or instagram or audience network or wherever audience network is off facebook on websites things like that and messenger so we'll just leave it as it is just being nosy have a look I'm going to choose a lifetime budget of 20 u.s and then I'm going to change the dates you need about 14 days the algorithm the ad algorithm needs 10 to 12 days to work so I would suggest 21 to 28 days so whatever the date is today I'm august the 10th to august the 31st I'm choosing a time when the ads are going to run and I would say that after school is a good time and again in the evenings it's up to you and your audience which audience you choose you're probably going to want two audiences one is for local one is for visitors because you're going to send different messages to the different audiences click continue and then down here I'm going to select a post I'm going to choose that we are yes we're open post looks like that click continue and now it's giving me uh previews of what it's going to look like so it's saying that's what it'll look like on facebook mobile news feed this is what it'll look like on the facebook desktop news feed and so I can see a preview of what it's going to look like um my monitor is squishing it you'll see more on yours it has to do with where I'm recording at the moment here confirm and that will create an ad that will boost this post boost an existing post into the mobile news feed the desktop news feed into videos into the instagram into the audience network like games and apps and things like that and then people who live in kitumba who fit the family criteria will see the updates for my services my restaurant my hairdressing salon whatever it is that I run in the blue mountains and that's a great way to boost an existing post on facebook and instagram to keep your local community up to date with what you're doing during the coronavirus in fact it's a good one to do during bushfires and other times as well I will say that some people say not to boost post but there's three really good reasons for boosting posts and not least of that is that you can have really long written posts with lots of information in them which you can't do with your standard ads I do recommend that you use a saved audience though to make sure that you reach my name is laurel papworth and I'm a social media strategist for some time I've been planning on putting together video series for the blue mountains businesses and organizations and I would really like to thank the blue mountain city council for stepping up and helping to sponsor this short video series on social media for businesses organizations not-for-profits thank you so much really appreciate your sponsorship thank you
So Marty one of our urban weeds team guys actually discovered a new aquatic weed that hasn't been seen in the Blue Mountains before and that's really important because once it gets in our waterways and into our wetlands it can actually degrade the aquatic habitat and the water quality so it was a really important discovery but it's common name is actually spongebob all jokes aside it's it's real common name is frog bit or sponge plant yeah so if we turn it over you can see how spongy it is underneath yeah right that helps with the flotation and at the top of it has a look of a green frog right yeah so I found this during a private property inspection in a pond in the backyard and it's illegal to both sell it and to have it okay and worse worse still it was passed between neighbors right so what else did you find I came across some water hyacinth so this is just as bad as frog bed so what should people do if they think they've got Mountain City Council and on four seven eight zero five three four three and a biosecurity weed officer will come out and discuss it with them yeah and of course people can go to get general weed information from the council website so that's just BMCC nsw go to a youth board snack foods thank you thank you
Hello my name is laurel papworth and in this video series we'll be covering social media during difficult times for the businesses and organizations of the beautiful blue mountains in new south wales australia welcome to the tutorials in this video we're going to be looking at a special kind of post that facebook has called the kovid19 post and if you mark your post as a covid19 post facebook makes sure that more people will see that content including people in the local community of the blue mountains there's also a special kind of second post bonus post called a pinned post that we'll be covering in this video as well I hope you enjoyed this tutorial we need to do a special facebook post that is both a coveted 19 post which is a category of posts that facebook has created and we need to do a pinned post it's actually the same post but we're going to mark it as coveted 19 and we're going to mark it as a pinned post and this is how we do it we's special for the business pages and you know you're on a business page if it says like there instead of friend or something else click on create a post that's where your market is a coveted 19 post and we have to include we don't have to but it's a good idea to include certain key features so when I click on covet 19 updates it says if you use this kind of post we'll make sure that more people will see it which is always part of the battle on social media is to make sure that the algorithm or the platform or facebook puts our content in front of the right people at the right time so it can help you reach more people in your local community by appearing more visibly in different places on facebook so it's going to be marked in a different way they're giving you some recommendations here what to place so I'm just going to say yes I'm going to share a covet 19 update and these are the key features that put the I put the date so this is the 15th of july and I also like to use a hashtag even if nobody else is using the hashtag I know that the algorithm reads the hashtags the next thing to do I'm going to number them but it's just so that we can easily refer to them you don't need to number them is I would make a statement I would make a statement about whether you're open or not whether you have extended hours or shortened hours or um yeah that kind of thing so one is yes oh yes we are open and then I would say tuesday to sunday nine to five p.m remember you don't need the numbers I'm just doing that so I refer back to them later number two any changes to your products or services so whether you're um if you've got a set menu now instead of a buffet or you have takeaway only that kind of thing set menu or bundle of beauty products or new services limited services product delivery anything think suits your business I know that up here in the mountains in the blue mountains of new south wales everybody has a different idea at the moment about what is safe so it's a good idea for you to spell out what is safe for your venue and you might be at one extreme or another or somewhere in the middle and obviously things change a lot which is one of the reasons why we put the date at the top of the update so that people can see week by week day by day things are changing but let's say this is going to stay where it's at for a little while a statement again you don't need the numbers but I would say something like your safety is our concern and this is where I would talk about the restrictions and the changes that you've made due to covert 19 so you might say mars optional or you might say mandatory I know that some of the health services have made the mass mandatory I guess other places not so much at sanitizer some of the businesses in the blue mountains that I've walked into particularly health services they've stood at the door with the hand sanitizer in other words if you don't take the hand sanitizer and use it then you're not welcome or you're not able to come in and then obviously other businesses have other needs so that doesn't have to happen also let them know if there's limited seating no more no tables of 10 or more people have to sit 1.5 meters away you have to sit to eat and drink you're not allowed to stand anything that you've implemented like that for your blue mountains business number four could be specifically what your staff do so you may say our staff wear masks I know a few of the supermarkets and grocery store stores have implemented that here in the mountains and what sort of things could staff be doing so staff would have masks they would have wiped down surfaces after every client depending on the business and how feasible that is that sort of thing surface every single time but probably around the till they do and then other services like chiropractors do all the time wipe down everything I would say what I would expect from the customer or client so please do not visit if you are sick your member of your party are sick I did see that some venues have cancellation fees so people are ringing up to say they're sick and they're being told they have to pay a cancellation fee so they say we're coming anyway not sure you want that and then bookings only so don't walk in the door and expect to get a seat because we're only taking bookings at the moment and anything like that and I would then probably finish with please check back for more recent updates and remember we're going to pin this post at the top of our page so it is the first one that people see even if you do a post later on it will be the top of the page and it's marked as a coveted 19 update to let just because it's the pinned post and it's the one that people are going to share when somebody says hey is there an optometrist open or is there a bar open or is there a gardening center open or whatever kind of business you have in the blue mountains I would probably finish with just some a little bit of contact details be careful because some algorithms will penalize you if you put your contact details on every single post but in this case it is a special post so I would say please call and then you know oh for whatever your telephone number is um for latest information you're trying to stop the calls in a sense with your pinned post your coveted 19 post because they can see everything here but if there's anything that's not clear people should ring you and then the nice thing is you can always come back in and edit this to make it clearer if you get a lot of phone calls saying I didn't understand your opening time so I didn't understand whether their questions are you can always update this and then say let me see great western highway kitumba just to remind people they're already on your page so they know the company name but they may not remember exactly where you are or something like that so that would do once you've done this you can post it here and I'll show you what to do once you've posted your covet 19 update with all the information on it in a second so your post will look something like this and if you go to the dot dot on your laptop I think there's something similar in the apps there's a few different apps so depending which one you're using you can also mark as a kovite 19 post here and then you can pin to the top of the page so once you've hit post and you've posted it go to the dot dot com down pin to top of page and this will put a little blue and white pin next to the post and you can see that the page until you either unpin the post or you do a new pinned post so even though you may be posting photos and different things during the week this will stay at the top of the page as a important example of questions faqs that your customers and clients might have for you and they'll be

brought a few guitars along this evening just going to grab an electric it's a bit of a strange uh strange looking guitar this one I actually collected all the bits for it uh individually um and then I got I'm not very handy at putting things together though but uh thankfully one of my mates is vernon zamora and he um he put this together for me and uh yeah it's got some weird things on it the weirdest thing about it is this uh lap steel pickup um which raikuda put on his strat and so I was really I really wanted to do my own version of the of the cuda caster so um the songs I've been playing a lot of them are off my uh a new album which I've recorded um and will be released august 7th if you want to check that out if you like the songs um I'm recently new to the mountains actually uh thankful that uh thanks that I'm considered local to be able to do this uh previous to living in the mountains I lived in the inner west of sydney and uh I lived in glebe for a while and one of my favorite bars was barclay mr falcons and then uh there was always great music gone and um and there was like blues dancing and it was always a big vibe and I did a really good gig there with my band and everyone was having a good time and then like the next day we found it was shut down because some people moved in next door and complained about the noise so that was a real bummer so I wrote this song about that it's called greed point road mm-hmm I think it's been years since I walked down this whole road no one seems to come here anymore since they closed up all the bars raised the rent up to the start now it's just a real estate ghost as I turn off broadway where lights once lit the stream be back here so quiet after time cause everything was shut early on a friday night where did the music go songs of pain songs how come we don't hear them tell me when was sydney now we're living on now I'm walking to the corner where mr falcons was there was always something going on up there songwriters sharing choose on thursdays they had but that expensive taste moved in noise complaints came deafening but did they really know what they were killing where did the music go songs of hope unseen tell me when we're sydney hmm where did the music go songs of pain and songs of hope how come we don't hear them anymore when did the artist leave are they hiding unseen tell me when we're sydney now we're live ah cool I've got some comments thanks lee thanks adam hey jenny thanks for listening you guys thanks stephanie thanks for listening in gonna change guitars again now as I as I

song in that vein so here's my go at it I think we're heading somewhere different than the place we set out for there's a haze claw at the sky I know it's not what we expected but I suppose it's kinda nice the smell of freshly painted white lines a new black layer on the colors out pothole mess below and I think we're finding out the meaning of that old term being brave and I think it's time we

 hi I'm spindle and today I'm going to show you how to use poi so what a poi poi are basically a big strip of fabric with a ball down one is so if you don't have these kind of things at home you can make your own you can get a long sock like this and a ball put it down one end and it's pretty much got a toy don't have any spare balls at home well get that sock again get another sock roll it up into a ball put this one in there and we're gonna pull that sock over the first one give it a bit of a twist I'm gonna put my hand down the end again and pull it through again and instant POI now I'm just going to show you a few basic tricks that you can do with your poi now that you finish making up we're going to learn about play so when I'm spinning the poi in front that's in the front plane and we've you don't want to have to stop and then trance traction what you're going to do is you're gonna start in the front plane so you're facing the poi it's going around and we're going to step away from the poise so see I didn't move the poi it's still going in the same direction and in the same plane I've just moved away from it I can keep moving so it's going to the back of me in the backbone or we can flip it completely around and it's going in the other side plane so you can practice this on the other hand you can stop and go in the other direction you can go through all the different planes again and once you've got that any practiced in both hands we can do that with two so we'll start with the side planes I'm going forwards and stopping going backwards up make sure you got lots of space to do this now that you've practiced using both sides what we're going in our side planes poi are going forwards at the same time you can change direction so they're going backwards and let's go Paul it's again and now you can try something called split timing so when you do split timing your hands are going to move up and down just a little bit so that when one poi is up in the air the other poi will be down and then they'll swap instead of going at the same time so we've got at the same time and now I'm going to split them you can try this in the other direction as well now that you've got this we're going to try something even more tricky starting with one we're going to do what's called a weave so the poi is going to go round to the top cross to the other hip come around again to the top cross that down to the other hip so let's give this a try so round so crossing at the front so up cross cross so you've got crosses at the front once you get this in your favorite hand then you can practice in your honor hand and once you get that do both at the same time which will be lots and lots of practice so that's very tricky get one in each hand first and then go for both at the same time thanks for joining me I'm Suzy spindle and that was a few basic moves using poi so you can go practice these at home if you'd like to learn more circus skills like staff juggling flower sticks and balancing or even more things then I hope to see you soon in one of my circus classes okay bye for now

 hey guys thank you for tuning into an art session we pin on Picasso Kitumba my name's Brock we're locals the Kitumba community we're gonna run you through the oh honey three sisters painting today so we're gonna be using a pretty broad color palette we're gonna be using a festive colors the sunsets the three sisters themselves and then the hills behind it now if you have access to them at home I'm gonna be using three different brushes I've got my thick medium and a small one just the finer details I've got a napkin and I have a little wattage eye here as well just to give my brush of the mix as we go from color to color but I'm gonna take you through everything step by step so I'm gonna begin the painting today by just wetting the brush a little bit and then here's my thick brush I'm gonna start with the background and what is gonna be your best friend in this stage because it's gonna help mix your'm going to start right at the top with long horizontal strokes with a purple just evenly coating the top portion of the canvas don't forget to paint the top and the edges of the canvas so that you don't have any ugly white edges as you go down you are able to add in a little bit of white and that's just gonna help the paint itself spread and help you mix the colors in to each other as we come down a little bit more we can start already adding in our oranges to give nice here you'll see that mixing nicely with the purple you don't have to be too particular about this having our Reds down below and again always referring back to our light to help blend in the colors together in a key cone with the white right down until I get about one-third of the way down the canvas no during this stage just be careful to get the positioning right of the three sisters themselves take note of where the points are on the canvas so you a half a dozen centimeters in the second one isn't even halfway into the middle of the canvas and then your third one is probably just over halfway so it's a start I'm just going to make a dot at the top of the three sisters themselves about here the second one I'm going to come down a little bit lower and place around here and then the third one I'll come down lower again about this that gives you your your spacing and then we know where to move on from there so I'm using my medium brush for this step I'm just going to almost make it an ant hill line down the side remember guys these are these are rather formation so they don't need to be super smooth they don't need to be overly smooth and we can just blend them in together like so now once you're happy with the outline of three sisters and we're just going to use plain brown and fill in the three sisters themselves you'll notice with with need to spread your paint as thin as possible unless you have a lot of time for it to dry but you'll notice that I am I'm just making everything spread as much as possible I am keeping the paint layer fairly thin and just going over and over and over it and just mixing it all together I'm just making sure that there's no pools of pain okay now once we wait for the three sisters to dry we're going to move on to these mountain ranges in the background hopefully your sunset is Israel and nearly dry now for their next step I'm going to be using a purple and I can mix in a little bit of light with that like so just to give it that that kind of classic misty look of the blue mountains starting towards the the edge of the canvas and about in line with this top and you're just going to be making some wave formations you make it as obvious or subtle as you like and being careful as we get to the to be using a lighter blue again mixing it with some white I'm gonna stop with these mountain ranges and these valleys in the foreground I've got my dark green here and I'm gonna be using my thick brush I'll mix in a little bit of blue and then you can always go darker as you go setting on the edge nice big smooth strokes right over the top and carefully filling in these gaps between the three sisters if you do have small amounts of black gaps that's completely fine we're gonna be going over the edges again in black you'll notice on the right hand side here you can see that the valley kind of curving down into there kind of into the gap behind the the three sisters so to give it that look I'm gonna add in a little bit of black to my color and just starting with long smooth strokes and going down like so I'm gonna fill in the the foliage at the bottom of the three sisters now just roughly paint in the be able to mix in the lid of the brown still you'd like to add in a couple of highlights with a light green that's completely fun as well and you can come up the rock a little bit as well once you're happy with how everything's looking your paint may be a little bit dry I'm gonna take ten minutes just to let my canvas dry before I go on to the outlines of my three sisters now as you approach the last step if you think you're about ready to tackle the details of the three sisters a good way to check that you're ready to go is just by dabbing your finger on the canvas if you've got a little bit of paint on it it's okay you can kind of see some of the drier areas that are ready to go and so again don't be too particular about this just be confident and make some some rough strokes here and there it might look a little bit funny to start with but fear not it orange here and then finally I'm just gonna add a little bit of pink to the canvas rather we're now ready to move on to the black so using my thin brush I'm just going to wet that a little drag off I'm just gonna get black but you don't have to mix it with anything and then I'm gonna carefully outline some of the edges of the three sisters so starting at the top carefully and a little bit of black light so you only need two thin edges you don't have to go around the entire three sisters I'm gonna stick primarily to the left and then just to help distinguish each pillow from each other follow it down like so and once you're happy with that you can then go on to add these lines there's horizontal black lines again with your thin brush just to cross like that just to give it a little bit of texture you can kind of come in close to the colors here if you like your canvas should start to come to life now again we're just gonna let it dry for five ten minutes and then we're just gonna add these cloud formations over the top and then you'll be ready to sign it in the bottom corner and and sell it for any price you like alright the final step guys we're moving on to the cloud now to do so you want to grab your thick brush now I'm just going to wet it slightly just to give it a thinner more transparent look just very carefully dab the tip of the brush in the white there you don't even need that much to be honest so you can kind of scrape off a little and you'll you'll get used to this after a second or two and you just want to with the point of the brush dab it onto the canvas like so to give it that flabby effect and you can come right over the mountains and you can add these wherever you like as big or as small as you like do you have any you can cover them up with clouds all right I am satisfied with my painting hope you are as well hope you've picked up a skill or two along the way as well really appreciated you joining us today now if you'd like to find out any more information you can find the subpoena Picasso online or peanut Picasso's blue mountains on their social media and if you'd like to join us in the future in our studio for a night of wine and painting live some fun we'd really appreciate your company and we look forward to seeing you soon you
 hi I'm Suzy spindle and today we're going to look at juggling balls so you don't have a set of juggling balls at home well you can use anything you like around the house so it just has to be about the right size to go on one hand not too heavy and not anything that's too precious or fragile you can use socks as well they don't look like juggling balls so what we're gonna do is grab any linked sock that you have by the toy roll it down to the open end get the open end and wrap it around the lump that you just made and you've got a set of juggling balls I'm going to show you a standard juggling move called the Cascade this is probably one of the most flexible moves that you can use for juggling as you can throw a whole bunch of other tricks in with it once you get comfortable we're going to start with one ball so just grabbing one ball in your favorite hand going up and and down and you're not taking your hand up to catch like that the ball is supposed to come to your hand and you want your elbows bent so arms fairly relaxed hands pretty much open and straight out in front ball goes just around forwards or head height okay let's try the other hand great now we're going to try throwing from one side to the other so let's start with just throwing this ball to that hand and back so in a rainbow shape so see my hands are staying around the same height I'm not reaching up to catch the ball like that I'm waiting for the ball to come to the hand let's try two balls one ball in each hand we're going to throw both up and down at the same time so same that's what we're doing with two balls at some point you will drop the ball but that's okay because you can always pick it up again let's try this time with one ball going up and one coming down timing so one up one down okay now still sticking with two balls we're going to throw one over to the other side we're not going to worry about catching so much at this point we're just getting used to throwing the balls up and over so I'm going to throw the ball so it's going to go down on the ground to the other foot then I'm going to throw this ball up down to the ground to the other foot so up and down up and down this is the pattern that you want to use when you're using two balls so let's try that again up and down up and down let's try some catching so I'm throwing from my favorite hand to the other hand in the same direction as this ball is coming towards this hand I've got to get rid of the ball that's in this hand so I'm going to throw that to the other hand you might want to count this as you're doing it so one two rid of that second ball until I have to you might want to go and practice this for a while now we're going to try three balls so this is the ultimate challenge so two balls in one hand this is your favorite hand one ball in the other hand this at the front that is ball one this in the other hand is ball two this is ball three so we're going one two three as I throw this first ball I throw the second ball as the second balls coming to this hand on throwing ball three I know it sounds really complicated so just watch one two three this is something you'll probably want to practice a lot and you might find that you're dropping more than you're catching but that's fine it just takes time so we'll start with 1 2 3 stop 1 2 3 stop once you get the hang of that then we're going to go on to the next step which is juggling three balls continuously every time you do this count how many maybe you start from one or two or three catches and then drop it and eventually every time you do it you'll get more catcher so 1 2 3 4 5 that's one lot keep going so let's see how long you can throw the balls for before you drop alright once you get the hang of that and you can do maybe 20 or 30 catches sounds crazy but you'll get there then you can try some extra tricks so while you're juggling the balls you can try bouncing off your shoulder try throwing under your arm all sorts of stuff you can try throwing turning around catching whatever you want the sky's the limit and then once you've done all that you can try 4 balls 5 or 6 balls thanks for joining me I'm Susie spindle and that was your basics on how to juggle balls if you'd like to find out more juggling tricks or other circus tricks then come to my classes I hope I'll see you soon bye you

 hi my name is Misha Aloha and I'm the owner and chef of a small restaurant in Kitumba called 8 things and today we're going to prepare a very traditional French dish called birth bourguignon and it really translates beef Burgundy so first we need to start cutting the beef and the cut is called Chuck so once you've cut the pieces quite thick we need to marinate it overnight so we put this in a bowl to that we add 1 carrot that I've sliced really thick because we're going to cook it for a long time we add one brown onion we have here 500 mil of red wine Pinot Noir is the closest you can get to the burgundy wine so wine goes in there then we're gonna do a bouquet garni and we're gonna tie it up with a string and that's gonna also sit in the marination overnight and here we go so that basically helps for the leaves not being loose all over the place and then just give it a bit of a massage it at this stage then we're gonna add the pepper it's about a tablespoon of all black pepper and lastly we're going to use our garlic which is also gonna be marinated I just show you a little trick on how to remove the skin of a garlic this ends you need to cut off this is no good to you then you just give it a bit of a push with your knife nice and flat and you'll see it just falls off the flesh so that's two and a half garlic goes in there as well so we're gonna marinate this for a good 12 hours in the fridge to give it maximum flavor we're gonna wrap it up with some glad wrap and we'll see you tomorrow I've just picked this up from the fridge now we're gonna do the cooking process of it and it's very simple once it's really hot we're gonna add olive oil it's fuming and now we put our meat in it very important is you leave it if you're moving it around then it's not gonna get a chance to caramelize so once you get to then the first side down of your beef you're gonna season it with a nice generous pinch of salt so because I have a small pan I decided to do it in two Lots because you don't want to overcrowd the surface and that will give it too much liquid and then again it won't then fry and color the me this is the right caramelization you're looking for nice and brown and then we're ready to turn so while your meat some frying up what we need to do is we need to separate the vegetables from the liquid because we're gonna fry those vegetables in the same pan that's pretty much ready we put it aside now we introduce the vegetables and fry the vegetables in the same trend so we're coating the vegetables with all that meaty goodness so once the onions are translucent or just about that means that they have been cooked that means that we go and then we got some beautiful juices can go on top don't throw that out that's probably some of the best flavoring you can get the next step is introducing the flour to this we're gonna turn it down what the flour is gonna do is gonna thicken your sauce so we're going to grab the flour and we'll just spread that flour on top and now we give it a nice stir and we cook that for about a minute or two so it's almost like toasting that flour so now that we floured the beef we're gonna introduce the marinated liquid so the liquid that's been marinating the beef overnight so we're gonna put it back on high heat we're gonna grab our stock and we're going to pour this all the way up to cover just up to this level so still meat is popping out but you know it will give you a good amount of liquid so two options from this point on option one is you can put a lid on and a half three hours the other option is you can put on your oven at 220 and then you can shove this dish in there and have it in there for two and a half three ours as well alright now we have our beef stew on the heat now we're going to do the garnishes that traditionally served with that dish in France we have very hot pan and we're going to start frying our bacon and you want it really sizzling and hot what we want to do is we want to use one pan to do all those together so we need to fry this bacon until the oil seeps out and crisp and then we're going to put the bacon away keep the oil in there to do the rest so while we're frying the bacon I'm going to show you how to remove the skin from the baby onions what you do to get them peeled whole is you take the top off and then you take this bottom part off as well then what you do is you the skin off all right bacon is crisping up nicely with a slotted spoon we're going to remove the bacon and keep all that fat in the pan I like to use locally smoked bacon from the butcher here up in Laura he makes his own all right so now we've removed the bacon and we're gonna toss those through the fat we're gonna grab a little pot this way and what we're gonna do we're gonna place the onion inside that little pot we keep some of that fat for the mushrooms some of that beautiful beef stock that we had fill it up before we're gonna cover it up and we're gonna put it on low heat now we still got some of that beautiful bacon fat in the pan we're gonna put butter and our mushrooms all right so mushrooms are being fried until Brown don't forget to season with a nice pinch of salt not too much but just a nice little now and when the mushroom gets to that sort of color what you want which means stop the frying process so we're adding liquid and we're using the stop again just to keep it in the field and those mushrooms are done we'll just set them aside so once you've done that we're gonna concentrate on getting our third side dish which is the potatoes and that's what you're gonna eat it with and it is gonna very important some people use sourdough to just soak up the bread in that beautiful sauce there is a great bakery up here and katoomba called black cockatoo they bake in Lawson and that's where I usually get my bread now we're gonna boil the potatoes so just a pot with lukewarm water you don't want to boil the water and then put your potatoes in because what will happen is it will split the skin you want to add some salt for a generous pinch of salt in there because you want the potatoes to be seasoned and then you bring this to a boil all right now our potatoes are cooked now that we drain you don't want to burn your fingers so I've used chat for this recipe because I like small potatoes to go with it but what I would always recommend is when you boil your potato always boil them with the skin on because it prevents from the potato to suck a lot of moisture in while cooking for this recipe we're gonna keep it old-school and we're gonna remove the skin because we want the butter to coats so very simple to peel a potato that's been cooked you make a tiny little incision in the skin and you just peel that skin off and it should come off really easily so now we're gonna finish the potatoes once you've peeled them we're gonna put in a hot pan some oil and some butter while I use oil and butter is because the oil is gonna make sure that the butter doesn't burn then we're gonna add the garlic then once the butter is melted and we've cooked the garlic half way through we're gonna introduce the freshly fry that herb you can see garlic is brown this frying and now we put it on really low all right now we're gonna put those potatoes in it reduce a little bit of salt remember you've cooked the potatoes with salt so they've sucked in some salt through the skins and we're gonna coat those potatoes with this beautiful butter and then you can put it if you want in the oven for a little bit to warm the potatoes through or keep it on the stove gently cooking okay this is it now look at this beautiful beef stew beef bourguignon now we're gonna garnish it so what I usually do is I put the mushrooms on the beautiful soft caramelized onions and then some of that crispy bacon on top and to go on the side our beautiful garlic potatoes okay we've just cooked at birth bourguignon beef Burgundy we have many other dishes from around the world here at eight things in Kitumba and if you want to come around and try them we're here seven days a week turn that into a beef pie the next day if you have leftovers don't forget
Now that we can all head back outside wanna take a road trip up to where the Sun sets and stay over where adventures big and small the wait where you'll find stuff you can't find anywhere else where you can treat yourself and where memories are made that's the thing about the Blue Mountains there's an entire range of possibilities a short drive but a whole world away so go blue stay a night or two
Now that we can all head back outside wanna take a road trip up to where the Sun sets and stay over where the folk are friendly with a food and drink as something else where art and culture thrive and with a star line is so bright you'll need shades of night that's the thing about the Blue Mountains there's an entire range of possibilities a short drive or a whole world away go blue stay a night or two
Hi I'm Suzy spindle and I'm going to take you through the foundations of hula hooping so we're going to start with waist hooping right so I don't know if you have a whole hoop and if you do do you know if it's the right size well there's a easy way to find out this hoop is the right size for me so I'm just going to put it on the ground in front of me and I want the top to come up to around the height of my bellybutton because if it's too small it's going to be really tough to hoop with and if it's too big it might be too heavy so it's important to find the right hoop for you before you get started so now that you've got your hoop you're going to put it around hip height and you're going to put one hand at three o'clock one hand at nine o'clock we're going to stand nice and tall feet around just a bit more floor so I'm just going to tuck my tailbone under and I'm going to look straight ahead if I look down the hoops gonna drop so I placed the hoop flat against your back and it's going to stick out nice and flat so you go to a big hoop belly I'm going to push the hoop around in this direction so my opposite hand is going to come around towards my belly and push that hoop off to the side so we're going to start with the easiest way to do this first I'm going to spin around in the same direction as the hoop and then we're going to stop we're going to let the hoop drop and standing nice and tall pushing this hand around and spinning around and stop and the hoots gonna fall down so let's try that again so hoop out in front nice and flat turning around and great okay this time we're going to try standing still so you'll need to give the hoop a bit more power you're going're just going to let the hoop drop to the ground we're not going to try and keep it up and we're going to see how long it goes around the waist before it goes on the ground so pushing one two three out drops let's try that again one two three and drops you want the hoop to go around your way three or four times before it falls to the ground so if it goes to the ground after maybe one or two turns try pushing the hoop a bit harder next time so I'll just show you what happens if I don't push it hard enough so see it just goes down straight away this time we're going back to our nice tall stance and we're going to try and keep the hoop from falling to the ground so we can move our hips side to side as the hoop goes around so side to side like that or push your tummy forwards and backwards without falling over and keeping your knees fairly straight and keeping your feet flat on hoop is just going to go crazy so let's give that a try remember standing nice and tall give it a good push let go and if the hoop pulls down pick it up and start again let's have another try so big pushes with the hips or with the belly keep that hoop up great now this is a bit of a challenge we're going to go in the opposite direction so this time I'm going to go this way this hand is going to come round push the hoop towards my belly and I'm gonna let go so are you ready and go you might have to push it a bit harder great okay so what do you do if the hoop falls to the ground because at some stage it probably will there's a few ways that we can stop the hoop from dropping so one way is to go that two-hour turn that we did at the start so pushing the hoop hoops starting to drop and spinning around it comes back up again so one thing you around it's just push that hoop a little bit harder as well so let's try that again so poop is going around the weight starts to drop so spinning around give it a push and it's back on the waist this time what we're going to do is try and push the hoop a bit harder and a bit faster if it starts to drop because that's one of the reasons why your hula hoop can fall to the ground it might be going too slow you may not be pushing it hard enough or you might have forgotten and started to bend your knees so the hoop starts to go towards them or you might start looking down and the hoop just drops so let's give that a try so who is starting to drop get it as soon as it starts to drop and I'm going to go harder faster tip comes back up so try that again waist chipping hit starting to drop and going slower I'm going to go faster faster faster faster faster and stop let's hooping this time we're going to go super far so ready in 3 2 1 and faster hey fast as you can and 3 2 1 back to normal waist to thing are you ready to try it again and 3 2 1 fast fast fast fast fast can you go even faster this time see how you can keep that up for it's a bit of a workout and 3 2 1 back to normal way to thing whew the last way that you can try and keep the hoop up is a little bit tricky so we'll just practice this without the hoop so the hoop is going anyways starts to drop we're going to get the waist to meet the hoop by just bobbing down so bending those knees not bending forwards keeping your back nice and straight we're just doing a little mini squat and then if the hoops going around in that direction I'm just going to use my opposite hip to bump it up again so just doing mini squat bump it up alright we'll try that always work this one's going to take a little bit of practice and we have to get that squat and bump as soon as we feel the hoop starting to drop so we're stripping hoop is starting to go down and scoop it up try that again hoop is dropping and scooping it up okay so that's a few ways just stop your hoop from dropping lastly we're just going to do a couple of cool things when your hoop does drop so firstly this is fairly easy one waist hooping it's gonna drop oh boy hah that was the end of my performance I meant that to fall on the ground alright again let's do another pose so here starting to drop Oh tada okay now there's a few other tricks that I can show you so one it takes a little bit of practice it's not too hard but I'm just gonna talk you through this so who has fallen down on the ground Oh No what do we do I'm gonna put one of my feet on that's closest to me I'm gonna press and I'm gonna roll the hoop back up I've got the hoop again how cool is that so again I'm using my heel you might find it better if you use the front part of your foot it it's really up to you so foot on the hip rolling it back towards you pip comes up we can try a bit of a variation on this and turn it into a bit of a magic trick so I'm going to go to the side so it looks extra cool and I'm gonna roll up and use my magic string invisible string to pull it up to me all right that's one that you can practice another one is hoop is on the ground this time I'm putting my foot under the hoop now your foot is going to come up towards your face and the hoop is going to come up towards your face so you're gonna have to as you're lifting your foot and tucking your knee into your chest come flying up into your face because nobody wants a hoop in the face so let's just try that first a couple of times without the hoop so ready and tuck and ready and tuck okay are you ready to try with the hoop so who is sitting on the top of the foot and it doesn't always work so be prepared for it to just fly off in all sorts of directions if it does that's fine pose you meant it to fly off over there into the bush of course you did so are we ready and tuck tada okay let's try one more time and ready and tuck and we can go back to our waist whooping thanks for joining me I'm Suzy spindle and that was one of the foundational moves with hula hooping waist hooping if you'd like to learn more hopeless

everyone I'm gonna get mission wings the world's done with all I can do that fly like an eagle it's something razzle now watch over you I'm gonna give me some wings some done paying my dues and I've done my best to try and keep grounded guess my best just didn't do I don't wanna leave here I don't wanna stay I've been trying to get home mom be stuck it's not hope my heart fans away I'm gonna get me some wings sickened him now bring spending they'll do just fine let this slap a man and I'm proud that I had to me I don't wanna leave don't wanna stay I've been trying to get home on this Turkish night off my heart fans away well I'm gonna shoes I call off the search what I am worth and I won't need a damn thing from you there's some dumb clicking heels making bad deal under the rainbow so I'll give this guitar a little bit of a cheer in Isaac the guys are working very hard here in the studio it's a really great setup it's fantastic and charity's got the rug underneath me here that she keeps fixing because it's got crease I told her that she's got a CD so this next song it's about those times in life where everything's crashing around you and there's there's no light not even a silver lining as such and the people and the circumstances trying to get the best of you in causing destruction I guess and havoc sometimes they're not really smart wood thinking and perhaps in their own Furion and madness that instead of leaving this havoc and destruction what they actually do is um make new paths and leave an another road for you without realizing it and we've's been that hard but if I wasn't there I wouldn't be here now and that's kind of what these songs about and I do make reference to my children in this song and it's all about the journey and this one's called avalanche he no man said avalanche I dig is sad it don't stand a chance it's tracks in the snow and we have been but the undergrowth is aware and Sam ain't no matter devilish a digger Souder don't stand chance so thank you for the way shame but it's gonna damn these loves mine and all the fear in my world and crash upon me now I learned with a love never be afraid cuz he avalanche stupid me left a path in its rage here it comes a devilish have come to know and understand if you cover your ears not your eyes you can face it all when the earth is quite feel it coming that evolution I've gotta stand tall make stance wants to shake baby in my soul toll and know the feeling in my world and crash upon me now I learn with a love never be free cause he abolition stupid left a path in its rage suck it older and I look back a fearless that oft math we must grow strong and take a chance never fear that ever I'm sorry for the times ice cream nothing else is gonna shatter land-speed it's just a rumble of the past let go zoom my work can crash upon me now hi learn with a love never be afraid and of the fear I have for him in the darkness where I've nailed Who I am today and that ever lived stupid left a path in its rage hey Karen Karina I should say what colors you here tonight Corrine mm-hmm she's one of the fittest people I know so this next one I got to thinking how much credit we actually give to those so-called demons that we're chasing I say chasing I think we give them too much credit I don are memories and scents and feelings and things like that and I had an old friend or a good good friend recently say to me that he believes that it's some old residual pain and stuff that we inherit and then we store up and I thought that's great so I use that tonight as a result of those feelings and memories and things and triggers like triggers for me you just move away from it you know you don't read the book or if you're watching a movie you don't you know you don't watch the movie or you don't associate with people who triggers you for some people those feelings and triggers do manifest into real tangible demons and that might be you know alcohol or drugs or violence and everybody does handle their demons differently I guess but thing is I don't think they're anywhere near as strong as us and the reason why I say that is because they are just thoughts and and we are thoughts and ultimately I think we're much stronger than we to stop identifying as the victim and serving it so um that's what these songs about and it is a bit cliche it's called demons and angels I know that's been done before but it lends itself to that so this is pretty new this one damage comb demon school you phase the fight in you take the blows man hell your story goes Dimas command demons go damage command demons go I credits rolling on a picture show and raw the souls that have been sold then the end if the truth be told demons would make good angels if we only set them free his demons are no strangers they're just a part of me demons come and fade away little rainbows and bakeries let the youthful will of a renegade demons come and fade away damn strap over your might to bake you we can lose a face they will reap what you have not sown and then the end if the truth be demons would make good angels if they're just a part of me Lane just come the names you'll stay but freckle cheeks and their honest ways they love away the shame final light on darkest so my friends if you wanna free your soul you gotta let those demons go Payne the thoughts and days gone by won't you let those demon thank you Steve thank you my friend actually Steve I was telling a story before how when used to record me when I was younger I had really bad siblings and that time where you said then do you pop too much when you're recording of course when I came in as a young young teenager I wanted to record a song called pink balloons so that was quite funny because you sure got some pops out of that one thank you Karen thinks Louise thinks Michelina thank you so much thank you Karen okay so I'm actually going to do this next when I just chin up a little bit again this next one I'm actually going to do for Willem I hope song over the years of mine and I thought I'd do it tonight I don't have a spoon player unfortunately this song is all about the Australian psychiatrist dr. Harry Bailey he headed up the chums food Hospital horrors we call them and between the years of 1962 and 1979 about 26 was 26 patients died under his care and a lot of others were severely damaged on my journey over the years back in 2005 I think it was I met some amazing people and I met this some this incredible credible man who had been deeply impacted by dr. Harry Bailey and funny enough I can't believe this but he was on Facebook last night and I haven't spoken to you for a couple of years and I was actually talking to him on the phone last night so that was love really lovely to speak to Michael look he was deeply impacted by Bailey I'm Bailey practiced something called DST which is deep sleep therapy and psychosurgery and ECT metric shock therapy and when Michael was 14 he had something that was days and his mother didn't know what to do and so they sent him to Bailey and people were going there you know for alcoholism and and drugs depression you know they were like guinea pigs I guess so Michael was 14 one morning someone came in and said how do you feel about your brain operation and that was it he had to learn to talk and walk and everything again so he's just the most impute aful spirit beautiful man he was telling me jokes all night so anyway I didn't like they specifically thought for Michael but for a lot of people that were impacted by him by Bailey and it scored mr. Bailey he will mr. bathing what the hell are you doing who keeps making house cuts fit in all our heart with fear hey there mr. Bailey where's your scalpel friend go does it ever do you like it did a little boy all those years ago mr. Bailey there mister baby who the hell gave you the right to muddle up the patience of the puns who you a troubled child with your PhD and your big leather chair we poured out of your mind mr. Bailey mr. vain thank you was for your glory and for those of you who are unaware it is a little story miss Polly had a dolly that was sick sick sick so she called for the doctor to come quick quick quick so Harry came with a pad on his back and knocked on the door a crack he looked at the girl and he gave her some ins prescribe some VST but the next day she was dead so Polly called the lawyer and the lawyers had a fight the people were outraged when water came to light so Harry grabbed some pills I mean a cocktail of defeat and said best to get my own eternal sleep retreat and the voices of their owner said he practice what he preached he practiced what he preached he practice what he preached he practice what he preached well mr. baby what the hell are you when he beuse keeps making house calls Finland all our heart will freaking insane doesn't see him shrink the pain in his eyes but someone speaks your name mr.

guitar again this sir next song keeping me thumb writing for girlfriends when she was memores my best friend but she's another good friend of mine this one that I'm about to talk about her name is a sherry Capobianco and I wrote this song for her daughter Madison Capobianco and she were her daughter Madison was that tragically killed 12 months ago in a car accident we two of her friends and they were my daughter's age about 18 and this was in Salem in the United States and here was a drunk driver and I met met sherry years ago sherry was had a book out called La Bella mafia and it was later on Tice would read titled no more crying angels and I got to sort of put some music one of the her poems for the book which was pretty exciting so that's how we met but that's a historian itself La Bella mafia and she was also very good friends with he was actually like a father figure to her Tony Napoli his book my father my Don don't know if anyone's read that book um but that that's an amazing read also so that's the way these songs entwined because Tony died damn not long before it wasn't too long before Madison did and I toyed with the idea that he was looking after her in heaven for sherry so that's how I got the idea this song and it's called sweet Angelo in Angelo in Italian means angel something tells me Tony despite that film a few top to the man they auntie shed an enormous countin on me you Salem's a long way and we're and you see a damn cherry staring up at the stars screaming Tony Taylor from a a mama wishes she was home today tell her from me always stay with the group and don't have a fly alone em see your prayers dry your wings so you don't catch a cold boy and I'm not there sweet angel down at the Parkway where the shop toes in the Reese catchy Berrien County and ever gonna be insane those Sunset Strip one last hit is ever gonna ease the pain she's screaming toning tell her from de mama wishes she was home a tailor from me always stay where

see you play Estrella waves so you don't catch a cold buona notte they're sweet Anjali thank you I think so I've Tina hello hey Maggie hey Aurora hey Jane hi oh I'm just getting a set this thing so before I do this next one I have a little sip of water first this one I would like to give a big shout I've worked with and continue to work with in my music family over the years and like I said continue to I'm a songwriter that's what I do I I love writing lyrics and melodies and you know I bash around on this guitar and hit a few chords here and there but ultimately I'm I am a songwriter I'm not a proficient musician I'm not putting myself down it's just is what it is but anyone who's worked with me there's a bit of an inside joke anyone who's worked with me will know that I am that I'll use 500k Pro positions to find the right key for the song and the right sound anything to avoid doing a single bar chord simply because I can't_''_3178.89 so it is what it is but a shout-out to my music family for believing in me and always um you know being the wings really because I can sit here and display these songs but they arrange them and give my songs wings and I'm very lucky to to work with it somehow Billy and hey Billy I'm going to do your song you're not one of my songs so I'd like to thank them very much for always being there for me and believing me and also thinking them that I can actually do this tonight and stand up here and do these songs raw and know they're still worth something you know without the bells and whistles so thank you guys I'm this next one's all about you know those people that you know the people that say oh this one's going to make it or that one's going to make it and and you know you hear them all the time while she's gonna make it and he's gonna make it and I just think we'll make what as we all know there's no money to be made in Fame or like to know that comes and goes doesn't it really so I still want to know define what make it means you know I'm just trying to make me and I've always done you know and you know to the to the people of the past you know um that a bit misguided maybe I was never out there to try and be a rock star or such or anything like that I just just wanted to write some songs and sing them and share some stuff with people so I'm just trying to really make make me you know and that's what these songs called it's called making me and two of those misguided people I'm not too sure what they'll be doing in thirty years time but I know that I'll be he's still writing songs and still singing and playing music till I've died so this is cord making me so somewhere I'm sorry in a heart that is content prefer whether accomplices that hold it with content freedom with good intentions every single day my penance and call of duty when I play I've never been good with numbers don't know the reason why pick a name my strong point but I be a star but I know my inner shine I've seen it's often madness and some very tortured eyes I don't want to make something of it I just wanna make some ground making others happy you're making any prayer making any difference or making something long I just make the toast I make the beds and I make my children warm I make coffee I make love make three nights and make ends meet make the sign of the Cross and I make a lousy cheat I'm making min away sometimes and I wait patiently but say she's trying to make it Lord without just making me never hooked up with strangers or ever shares my skin I kept a kind of reverence with boundaries deep within and the journey ain't for others in theirs not for me we all walk such different roles symmetry had a different spirit among my family tree I knew I had to set my free surprises like a phoenix some rides through mystery but I just rose above the stones and cast some Timothy just wanna make some ground I'ma makin others happy home making any prayer making any difference so making something long I just make the toast I'll make the beds and I'll make my children won't make copy I make love make green lights and make ends meet I make the sign of the Cross and I'll make a lousy cheat making little

 okay this is a u.s. Turkish australasia NZers you can tell by it's got three spines on the carpus three little spines here one two three it's found with another crayfish species us Turkish spinner further looks very similar but the spinner FERS will have more spines along their back here more thoracic splines and more abdominal spine so greater spy nation along here and they'll only have two spines on this Maciel car pool surface it's a burrowing species so really likes good water high oxygen cool temperatures and it lives in creeks and streams all through the Blue Mountains and the Sydney region it's a relatively robust Hardy species tolerates the far bush fires we have and the droughts because it builds a burrow it lives in this burrow system which is like a little fortress that protects it and being a very long-lived species 20 or more years these little animals all dig their burrow system for 20 or more years so they're updating and renovating their burrows for 20 years so massive sort of barrow systems which just riddled a year the the girls and it takes about six months for the young to actually hatch out so they breed around May and release around about December each year into the streams little babies
If to president Avenue Allah Kagura when completed in 2025 the toll road will slash eight minutes off the drive from kagra to the city we have had our first look at plans for the shiny new five billion dollar Western Sydney Airport but instead of a warm welcome the design has been met with anger from locals the only thing they want to see is the flight paths that will impact their homes flying into the future and landing at the Western Sydney Airport in 2026 the federal government today turned the clock forward to show off the designs for the new terminal with soaring timber ceilings landscape gardens and flanked by two runways a design that nearly maximizes the customer experience a true 21st century Airport for one of the two winning architectural firms it's a far cry from Beijing's so-called starfish terminal it completed just a month ago what I would say is that it's horses for courses and the designers insist the terminal is not just for the 10 million travelers who will pass through the doors but for locals to come and is the center of the new city that is as a community place fundamentally absolutely construction is charging ahead we now have a name for the airport and a fair idea of what the terminal will look like but there is still one great unknown the flight path for this 24-hour airport and who will be impacted on the ground 2021 was a date previously given by the government to announce an early draft on flight paths well before the airport opens before the airport opens and that has people living in the heritage-listed Blue Mountains as nervous as ever my fear is that you know the airport will be done and dusted before we see the flight paths and they'll say it's too late for us Damien Ryan 9 news three days out from the Halloween deadline and brexit has been delayed yet again
Entertainment today saying it will not make any comment at this stage about redundancies changing times in DG Remington thank you we can show you tonight what the Westin said the airport will look like when it finally opens in 2026 and while the fight continues over flight paths the government today made a rather remarkable claim that the new airport won't just be for travelers but a destination in its own rush a peek seven years into Western Sydney's future the new airport perhaps plane on the outside but indoors travelers will bustle under a canopy of sunlit timber the architects muse we're told tree bark we dreamt what it would be like to walk underneath an Australian forest and to see that Great Australian light coming down the winning terminal design they say won't just be a place to board an aircraft a place that people can come to people can feel they belong to it I'm talking about residents a destination in itself absolutely I mean Changi in Singapore is interesting because many people go there just for dinner at a port the Blue Mountains although the mayor there hardly felt inspired today the issue people really want to know about are the flight paths that's what residents are most concerned about they remain shrouded in secrecy and while construction here is ramping up the government revealed today those residents who have concerns won't be given any answers anytime soon the next draft will be in the next two or three years then the final conclusions will be made well before the airport opens it will start small the size of Adelaide Airport but with room to grow to perhaps the size of LA Airport by 2060 Daniel Sutton 410 news first staying with this after the break to drive a charged driver 13
 project planted is our way of connecting with younger kids and helping them learn about the importance of nature and trees and our environment around us here in the Blue Mountains trees are important because they're big staples of the environment and they also take in the harmful co2 in our atmosphere and put out oxygen and co2 is what's warming the planet so they're also really helpful for climate change experienced at youth council was given me is one of sort of a platform to go from and to be able to have the connections of speaking the schools and people inside the community that have can have a real impact I mean the people here today with the bush care programs here in Dai reserve it's pretty incredible and it's um it's really amazing to learn the history and the culture that we have here so I'm really grateful for that this I love kids and I wanted to encourage them to get involved with nature and planting trees and the future of our planet because climate change is me because they really are the lifeline of our planet and they're really what is keeping this one alive and producing everything we need know she allows us to get away from city or town where we live in away from cars away from airplane noise who just allows us to enjoy nature and life without all the stuff that has come since that council supports youth council because we want to give young people in our area of high-school age of voice young people can find opportunities in existing council projects they can develop their own projects they can develop leadership skills event management and project management with the support of council staff and other professionals within our area children really enjoy days out like today we we had some really encouraging expressions of that with some of the kids saying that they were having a wonderful time how much fun they were having one little girl even said that she had had the most fun she's had in years and their energy is really important for the local volunteers too because that really energizes them and know that the young people are interested in looking after the environment of caring for the bushland in the same way that they are so this was an opportunity for us to particularly if we could work with the schools and young people in the mountains is to to really get them out there so anything we can do to get children outside and connecting back reconnecting with nature is one of the reasons why we did it and the other thing of course is that it's great to support young people in the mountains in any way we can and to and so in this project when the team the Youth Council team came up with the project it was like well why wouldn't we support it one we're really concerned about the loss of biodiversity in mountains and so to be putting local provenance plants back into some of these really special areas is so important to us I likes planting plants it felt fun because I like planting plants with my family and with other people when we went on the bush walk so hugged a tree before my favorite part was going on the bush walk we learned that to dig off like foot water and I hold them plant the plant of mint cover the plant back up and then put water over it again I'm planning all the prints I like getting dirty so what I enjoyed most about today was seeing the smiles on my students faces if they're engaged in learning in the outdoors and finding an important meaningful learning to move forward into the future so thank you to project plant it my students have had a great time learning today and being in the outdoors we're Emily public school really appreciate being part of your project thank you Youth Council has been really important for me personally because I've been able to connect with so many other kids who are like me and I really want to see change in the Blue Mountains and a better future for youth so the bigger part of Youth Council has helped me develop my leadership skills it's enabled me to connect with other people fed the nature can have on our lives being a part of Youth Council has given me a lot of confidence it's allowed me to kind of grow as a person and it's given me skills in project planning and event planning and it's also made me grow a lot you

There's a little slice of the Blue Mountains where time has Stood Still along the eastern escarpment with its towering gum trees and its sandstone gorges now the local council is opening it up making an historic trail accessible to just about everyone beneath the treetops and through the high walls of sandstone cuttings this is a part of the Blue Mountains you don't see in the tourist brochure right now if you're a fit cyclist or bush walker you can access those walkways but we want to make this area accessible to everyone the lights turn zigzag walking track on the eastern escarpment isn't just a bush walk it's a piece of history the picturesque sandstone walls were blasted away way back in the 1860s to build the exact railway and traverse what was otherwise an insurmountable area along the walk you even pass an old railway station the platform is what remains lucasville train station and it was actually designed as a zigzag to help move things up and down through this area and at the end siding look out views over the now the walk is about to get a two million dollar facelift the path will be concreted to make it accessible for everyone even wheelchairs but the concrete has been controversial among local users I don't think concreting is way to go I think the people that use the track the only people they enjoy walking down and on a bit of broken ground and all the rest of it this particular track was chosen for an accessibility upgrade partly because it's relatively short and flat it's also close to Sydney just a 5-minute drive from Penrith and less than an hour from the CBD has this been a bit of a local secret look I think it has been I think for people that live here they know it they know how beautiful it is they know the history of the area and this is an opportunity now to show everybody just how special this is consultation on the upgrade begins this month Jana's a party 9 news
Today we're heating along the subject of the aeroplanes flying over the Blue Mountains we had decided to interview some kids on this subject to see what they think about the whole thing hello I hope you like about mountains they're growing that's a good thing about my office and well the loads of bushland which is fantastic for doing stuff so yeah the bush line is great ok well the armored vehicle organizing said and also the quiet of the mountains and all the bird noises and the natural habitat would be this worked and that would be terrible and also that would be every 12 minutes you won't get a break from no no we wouldn't not even a knife which would be what hello what excuse me what do you like about the mountains well I like the fact that I can sleep the air isn't polluted like it is in the city or there's lots of animals and plants and we have lots of space to run around and yeah this is peaceful and nice so what would you head every day well that none of that stuff would still be here all the animals will have run a runaway the air would be horrible and I couldn't sleep I do you think that will interrupt your learning in any way as I've heard that it's going to go right over schools yes I think it would make it very very hard to concentrate some people also have concerns on the following issues the effects of continuous noise pollution on children's learning and health the effects of toxic aircraft emissions on children's health the effects of deep deprivation on children's health and well-being the loss of a manatee in our local community the lack of mid mitigation strategies or compensation to schools under the fright flight path other people also have general concerns about EIS in particular the lack of clear evidence given for the need of a second Airport in Sydney the lack of reasoning and explanation for the one point merge system and lack of alternatives offered the lack of maximum levels to minimize community disturbance the risk of public safety services not properly addressed and if a viral arm is not heard that could be bad of course people have suggested things that we can do instead many people have suggested a curve flu consistent with the curve flew in a place for Kingsford Smith Airport restricting the types of aircraft and operations allow between 11pm and 6pm a.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays particularly regarding the older and noisier aircraft use and now that concludes our news session on the battery creeper you
But kids love a day out of the classroom we don't even sometimes realizing it they've taken on board a whole lot of information that they wouldn't have been able to get in the classroom or online the Blue Mountain City Council has run a bio blitz day for us the students are involved in a series of activities that look at turbidity at the pH of the water at the types of animals that live in it and then they're heading down into the bush at the back of our school these ones are the ones that even um very clean water because they will probably die if they didn't because they're very sensitive to pollution these ones aren't that as sensitive so they can even a teeny bit put a little took water I find it it's something that I have a real passion for because I think that children really need to have a sense of place and that's what that encourages there's lots really well into the new geography syllabus the Earth's environment it also science and the maths the whole positioning of mapping and location and place and those sorts of things which is excellent as well being outside in the bush allows children with learning difficulties such as not being able to read or with short attention spans to really achieve by getting in there and experiencing something in a in a way that we can't normally cater for I love seeing that light bulb moment when kids go on and find something that they suddenly say oh look what I found look what I found and I love that in this sort of that's that's that's why I teach you
Hi I'm Mark Green Hill and mayor of the Blue Mountain City Council and with me is David White Secretary of the Kitumba RSL sub-branch now we felt that it was important that our community is aware that Anzac Day marches and the Blue Mountains are going ahead in 2017 credibly recent reports in the Sydney media relating to the cancellation of anzac day marches and the Blue Mountains got it wrong on a number of fronts importantly it is not the case that Blue Mountains new council cancelled local Anzac Day marches the threat of canceling local Anzac Day marches was a direct result of the cost of new south wales government requirements for anti-terrorism security measures the possibility of local Anzac Day marks has been cancelled is just unacceptable to me and it's unacceptable to my community so put simply Council and our local RS or branches have work together with the New South Wales Government to overcome the challenges of conducting the Anzac Day marchers in a changing world so we're very pleased to say that local and duc de markets will go ahead had a great relationship with council over the years and we've had invaluable assistance in delivering previous Anzac Day commemorations it's a great relief that we can proceed with Oakland Zach dome oxygen 2017 and we're sure that we can continue to work together to preserve the proud heritage of ANZAC in the mountains what we need though is a co-ordinated approach to the management of future Anzac Day activities and importantly a sustainable funding source going forward and I agree with David completely he's right we need a coordinated approach between all levels of government uncertainly can't go on every year well we hope you can attend one of the Anzac Day Services and marches in the Blue Mountains on 25 April to honor our local heroes have served and continue to serve our nation and of course our fallen heroes thanks very much for listening
The prince henry cliff walk was one of the first walk systems created the prince henry cliff walk is part of a wider track network that councils hoping to create where we link existing tracks so we will have to build some new tracks but they will only be sections that link existing tracks the scenic southern US government is the southern escarpment of the Blue Mountains tourist precinct and we're wanting to brand it as such to not only taking an echo point but other destinations such as katoomba falls and cars look out and Gordon Falls area the button short bridge is a very important link in the Prince Henry report which is a state Heritage listed walking track the button shop bridge is a complex piece of infrastructure in a natural area of the city and the button Shore bridge behind us here it was closed for three years created a missing link in the track complex here it's across a 30 meter deep canyon with two big overhangs on either side and this required seam geotech work to work out the distances that we unique location on the edge of a cliff within the Blue Mountains World Heritage listed national park with the environmental branch getting the the funding and the geotech reports then we had water services completely fabricated the bridge off site and then just brought in as they had jigsaw you know well the biggest challenge of the bridge was removing the old existing porting concrete built in 1935 bridge it required some Tyrolean cables across the bridge to hang the workers off once the bridge was removed the concrete footings report on the edge of the cliff and once this was done we helicoptered a bridge in that was built off-site by Dean and Scott formerly services this bridge was designed with the mesh floor so that it gave the walker that feeling of looking straight down over the canyon the visitors experience has been enhanced with you cringe so the upgraded renewal works from katoomba falls reserved out too quickly look out we've incorporated some fairly innovative features within the walking track so we've incorporated under Al lighting so people can enjoy accessing the view at any under our lighting but there are big bulky boxes that used a lot of power so we investigated the use of LEDs in the hand rail and we found a very small event of proof fitting they can have only low-voltage running through the hand rail rather than high voltage it's more energy efficient and a lot safer and it's been designed so that if there's any damage to it a panel can be removed and replaced quite easily and that the system can't_''_175.03 be vandalized in between regard to the design we obviously want things to comply with high safety standards and be safe for people and provide opportunities that people might not otherwise have in order to access natural areas we saved a significant amount of money by having an in-house design management and delivery team clean design so that it's easy to to build easy to maintain and will have a long life span the castle guard is actually the westernmost extremity of the scenic southern escarpment the westernmost lookout it overlooks mega long and can Imbler valley so in late 2014 we closed the reserve so that prompted us to look at the way we were potentially going to redesign so we've provided for greater access to people through removing steps that we previously had in reserve and providing a ramp pathway that comes down to the new Boar's Head lookout that looks out over narrow neck plateau as well as bores him it broadens opportunities for visitors to access this point part of the precinct upgrade he has included access to some of our really popular climbing and abseiling sites previously as an earth track we had a lot of problems with erosion and soil loss so the opportunity to upgrade it and stall stone steps and manage that sediment and erosion has made it have less impact on the environment and be a lot safer for people to the grapefruit man's trial come right past Kyle's lookout and a great place to stop em just survey the wonderful grand clifftop walk as a product will certainly offer a world-class experience to visit it as close to Sydney so it's an accessible product and really of people to visit the mountains and maybe stay a little longer the upgrade of the walking track network also benefits local residents it's a significant investment over a number of years to upgrade these tracks the project and design and delivery team has been quite an integral part that counts as managed to have that in-house expertise in order to deliver the program at works other results fantastic you and you have to just come down for a walk yourself to see it you
Hiya mark Greene he'll marry the blue mountains next Saturday the 15th of October Council will be holding a community meeting here in glenville park the purpose of that meeting is to discuss our community's response to the federal government's environmental impact statement for an airport at Badgerys Creek this is the biggest single environmental issue confronting the Blue Mountains right now and perhaps for a generation it's really important that we know the community's view about where to from here and the messages we need to be sending to the federal government I'd really appreciate it if you could come to glenbrook park on the fifteenth of October to tell us what you think about how we should take this issue forward
What type of change would you like to see in your community I'd like to see more activities for youth in the mountains I'd really like for youth to be more actively involved in the community I would like to see a community with more support networks for youth I'd like to see less youth homelessness to attract grants for sustainable projects I'd like a sustainable and clean environment how would you like to see this change happen through volunteer work and community service start a campaign a more open discussion about issues that matter start a petition for things you're passionate about by supporting green projects in schools participate in project now project now is an opportunity for young people to develop projects related to sustainability and social justice that will improve their community three projects will be selected to receive a share in six thousand dollars with the projects being presented in early 2017. blue mountain city council and youth council are hosting the project now youth congress between the 22nd and the 24th of september at the blue mountains theatre and community hub at springwood you
Blue mountains is a city that it's classified as part of Western Sydney and it's a ribbon of townships that is quite unique in that it's bordered by world heritage goodness the council has a history of supporting creatives but as far as an outdoor gallery goes this was fairly unique particularly given that it was in the center of katoomba which has a lot of focus on its history the 1930s architecture its identity is based around the historical nature of its architecture so to propose an outdoor a spray art gallery space spraying directly onto walls was quite a big initiative to undertake we sat down and we talked quite extensively about a bit of a communication plan we have a lot of young artists in the Blue Mountains but also we had great contacts with internationally based artists that could come over and act as role models for those younger artists all artists can go on to our website and download the very simple application form street art walk will be an ever-changing gallery space and hopefully that will encourage people to continually come the street art walk is it gives yet another thing to try and hold people a little bit longer in Katoomba so they can experience the town and experience all the unique things that we have in the town street art walk very soon within six months after it being completed already registered four and a half stars on tripadvisor it pops up as one of the top ten things to see in the Blue Mountains we think that this the awards is a great way of maybe encouraging other councils to look at ways in which using the arts using the creatives within their community to stimulate their economies and to stimulate pride within their communities is a great no now we're really proud of what we've done so the whole community is behind it
Screwed up as a place here as well with one of Australia's biggest street art collections now some might call this graffiti but Marvin's youth services manager Damien Cooper sees this as pure art so David this is quite something of what these old buildings to life and he did it all in one weekend well it was there was a lot of work leading up to that weekend but indeed they are all 34 walls painted over the course of one very big weekend have you fluent artists from what sao paulo in brazil that's right we had a number of international artists come in we had artists coming from around australia sydney melbourne and then we had a number of local young artists as well so you think of what was probably a very drab backstreet here in Canberra transform but I think most people probably would have felt uncomfortable walking down here on their own before we painted it is about that urban renewal and it's a very exciting place we hope to see some coffee shops opening up down here you know of the area
I'd like to share the fact that our people have have a beautiful reputation and tradition of looking after the country the country was pristine up to 227 years ago and it's been a struggle for us to continue our our role in looking after the country that's how our now regardless what the law courts and all that say we still hold very strongly that we have a an obligation to look after this country it's as you can imagine it's a very hard job we've been made quite powerless and we're a minority and in fact five percent of the the mothers traditional country is is natural the rest of it's been destroyed now most of a whole lot of us my family have moved up to the mountains because this is the most western area of my mother's country where we can live with trees we've and it's done as well with vermin we've got World Heritage Area all around us where we've actually up here we have one of the strongest Aboriginal communities strength we look after each other and we've begun to connect with the country again we have camps out in the bush where and the way we connect with country we sit with it instilled us and we listen to the country now heaven those planes go overhead that just trashes everything it was the last wild river the gross value for us we thought it had protection for national parks we thought it had protection from the World Heritage Area but it seems that this proposal goes ahead it's just trashed the last bit of our country now where the people that showed governor phillip where the damn water was yeah what a mistake that was and now they took this country office because according to them we weren't looking after it properly well my goodness time to take it back I think but we don't want to do that we want to share the country one I have a beautiful healthy country that's that's going to be passed on to our our generations as we've done for thousands and thousands of we need our natural areas where I'm gosh I in the gross value at govern sleep I I tell an important dreaming story there so I call it a white fellas dreaming story but it's an important one it's the most important one in that Valley for me and it's where the birth of the conservation or the environmental consciousness happened down there in the blue gum forest that's how I present it to people well aren't I going silly telling that story when this plant when I have to stop as I did when I was being interviewed up at my camp when a plane passed overhead we have to stop the interview wait till it passed well I'm going to quite stupid telling us how Australians have woken up to their responsibilities in it and they're sorry but it's no worries times expired but LSU you will recall that world heritage was declared over the greater Blue Mountains area in two thousand and that just a couple of weeks ago we celebrated the 15th anniversary you will know that blue mountains including the fact that large amounts of it our wilderness you will know that a development affecting a World Heritage Area must receive the approval of the federal minister for the environment under the environment protection biodiversity conservation act this is a consequence of our treaty obligations under the world heritage convention you may know that the major management document for the World Heritage Area at the moment is a strategic plan signed off by state and federal environment ministers and I just want to read you one paragraph it says the undisturbed natural environment is one of the important qualities that attract residents to live in areas are joining the Great Creator Blue Mounds area potential threats to the appreciation of the area's aesthetic values include inappropriate lighting as well as overflights by helicopters low flying jets and other aircraft a fly neighborly program has previously been established in the Blue Mountains National Park to minimize the impact of aircraft but this needs to be reviewed and made stronger and more extensive controls applied that was written into a plan a formal government supported plan in existing arrangements we've got to make them better what we now have as an is an environmental impact statement that suggests that we will crisscross the whole blue mountains including large areas of wilderness with commercial jet flights and they haven't even measured or predicted the noise impacts against a natural background they've done it on the basis of a noise measurement you might take in an urban area this e is is most extraordinarily botched and disappointing and utterly unsatisfactory I just want to add this two years ago the Abbott government went out of its way to attack the idea of world heritage you may recall that world heritage had been declared over the tall you could forests of Tasmania three years ago and two years ago the Abbott government tried to undo that declaration they were rebuffed by the world heritage committee of UNESCO amid really it was an ignominious end for the government's attempt to undermine world heritage but here it is essentially beginning to happen again and I would like to ask really if the Turnbull government is as is as government has been in the past take you very much our children can expect a plane every eight minutes during the day and every 18 minutes throughout the night this increases to a plane every four to six minutes 24-7 only 1,500 meters above homes in 2050 research has shown that aircraft noise differs from train and traffic noise as it is unpredictable and it varies this has a greater effect on children's reading and cannot be compared to traffic noise the point merger system places an unfair noise burden on our children causing disruption at school sleep deprivation which is also linked to negative health and social outcomes our group is demanding the same treatment and legislation for all communities and vulnerable groups in western Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport has a cap on the number of claims per hour and a curfew they use the ocean so only forty-five percent of planes go over the land they spread the noise by implementing a star system where flight paths are rotated so no said new school or sydney home has to endure planes every four to six minutes twenty class system couldn't be used for a second Sydney Airport research shows a direct link between noise pollution and it's negative impact on learning it can cause children to read more slowly reduces their performance in tests like the HSC causes developmental delays and it interferes with children's motivation memory language attentiveness concentration and speech in particular aircraft noise also causes children to have elevated blood pressure increased stress hormones strokes and heart disease children are more at risk from air pollutants and breathing double the amount of air from adults we already have high asthmatic rates and toxic aircraft emissions will cause increased lung and respiratory problems our educational environments are quieter compared to other urban settings we require a more rigorous study into the EIS and implementation of best practice flight paths they must consider the unique topography the effect this has on noise distribution and accurate the estimate aircraft noise especially for freight planes our prime minister has stated he has a lifetime commitment to supporting education we call on the government to live up to their word and ensure that no child in funded development our group seeks best practice and advocates for a change including fully engaging Kingsford Smith Airport to one-hundred percent capacity and considering fast rail removing the point merger system equitable sharing of plane noise like the star system used in Sydney limiting and setting noise limits and air pollution limits moving the second Airport to a place which will not send large volumes of flights over our world heritage and community areas speakers top all nicely done I'm a retired scientist and I have worked in the field of industrial health for over 30 years I'm here to talk about the noise aspect from the planes the draft noisy is uses noise contour charts for noise x.x packed acceptability as defining in Australian standards yes 2021 if you go to the Western Sydney Airport website and click on to the noise modeling tool tool you can find out the ANS the noise contour for your home there are three different types of aircraft noise contour charts refer to the standard the anif a NEC and a nei of these the standard states that the ane f is which is intended to have status in noise in land use planning decisions the EIS s are using a NEC modeling contours which are estimated guesses I call them guesstimates from the noise modeling tool some people will think that they will not be affected by noise for example for the year 2030 springwood public school is given an a a NEC value of less than 20 which the EIS considers acceptable in spite of the fact that there will be 30 to 40 planes flying overhead during brigade the a NEC value for our home in valley heights for the year 2030 is also less than 20 but we will have 30 to 40 planes flying overhead during the day 10 to 20 during the evening and 10 to 20 during the night all this is considered acceptable by the e is the use of a nes contour charts in this man is contrary to the requirements of historian standard and people can be misguided use them however a major problem also lies with the Australian standard it does not address noise contour in outdoor spaces and it is a guideline and is he irrelevant for the Blue Mountains which has ambient noise levels of role below that bat of cities our bedroom has a noise level of about 25 DB I the standard considers 5th ed ba to be adequate for bedrooms this is this is about 256 times higher than our current noise level in the bedroom please be aware that for each 3 DB increase the noise level doubles like thank you thank you Thank You Christian knows momentarily nervous there we had talked about noise levels in the bedroom the next speaker is mr. Keith Muir the foundation is the original proponent of the World Heritage Area and we've had a lot to do with the national parks and wilderness areas in New South Wales and in particular in the Blue Mountains we urge the council to continue its opposition of this terrible proposal which will seriously impact upon the World Heritage Area you have done a fantastic job we urge you to bring the community groups that are opposing this airport together and together we can build an even stronger Alliance towards the noise impacts I know that from way back in the dark ages when we were opposing helicopter noise in the seven in the 90s that background is 23 to 25 DBA out there in the blue mountains national parks so a to oil twin-engine airplane which carries 250 people will omit between five and six thousand feet about 63 267 DBA and that's about two orders of magnitude at least louder than background so you're really getting a significant amount of noise for those 10 seconds that error plane passes overhead and that has not been considered in any way mitigated by the e is there are ways of doing it they didn't even consider it and I think that from what I'm hearing the the world heritage area is where noise is going to be shifted to and I I really oppose that and the colon foundation will fight it to the end now the other key issue is air quality in western Sydney people will die as a result of this Airport in fact it's in the e is the mortality rates years exceedances of air quality standards for fine dust particles and nitrous oxide that's a small fraction of what this Airport will generate and it is generating those impacts mainly from vehicular traffic that is just unacceptable and yet they could think about bringing a train in it's not there there are no criteria or triggers in this proposal to do anything to protect the health of Western Sydney it's been known for many years that has got air quality pollution problems and that is I think fatal to the location of the airport in western Sydney it's absolutely apparent that a proposal kills people and I think the Blue Mountains Conservation Society submission makes that point very strongly so together we are more stronger than individuals this council has done a fantastic job anybody who's desperate to get a submission in we've got a web form on our site if you've got people that are half half keen and don't you know will click on something but do nothing else point on our way we've got a forum for them forward and stop this thing I'm speaking tonight because I support environmentally responsible infrastructure development which means I have to be against these flight paths and the building of a second Sydney Airport tonight I want to talk about strategy and how we can give ourselves a chance of winning this campaign to win the campaign needs to be much more than a Blue Mountains campaign it needs to be much more than a Western Sydney campaign it needs to become a national campaign and an election issue for the next federal election so how do we make this campaign a national issue it's not hard the case against the second airport in western Sydney is about much more than noisy flight paths and protecting the environment it is about what sort of a society want Australia to be what is our vision for the future are we to be a modern forward-looking society taking advantage of innovative new technology and new transport systems such as high-speed rail to reduce our carbon footprint or are we to continue to rely on last century fossil fuel driven technology and the world that is the question that this campaign asks and that is the question that will take the blue mountains from an iconic Australian attraction on the tourist map and put a center stage on the political map as we take this issue to the Australian people will the lucky country become the stupid country that misses the boat when it comes to the new employment opportunities that are opening up as the rest of the world charges ahead with innovative schemes to replace fossil fuel and transport networks with alternative sources of energy production and transportation will will be known is the country that trashes a World Heritage Area by building an airport and an unnecessary airport at that on its doorstep the campaign to protect the environment and preserve the quality of life and the Blue Mountains artists a very big question it asked where is Australia heading when it comes to creating a dynamic and productive low-carbon economy and a healthy environment for us all to live this is the same question that's being asked by the campaigns against coal seam gas and the campaigns do we want environmental and economic mayhem and disaster caused by backward-looking policies or a brightly Korean future for our children and grandchildren based on innovative green technology high-speed rail is part of that bright clean future let's put high-speed rail on the political agenda as part of this campaign to protect our mountains let's put environmentally responsible infrastructure development on the political agenda as we fight to preserve our way of life in this very special part of the world I think the case has been so strongly put that there is no need for this Airport Sydney Airport has the capacity the case is being put on health grounds on environmental grounds how great strength and it's what I would like to really concentrate on is there so many people here bob davis and I am sure would agree that when you're sitting parliament you know you can get so much more done when there is a strong public voice we're coming into christmas and I imagine you all have relatives across the state across the country we need to start the conversation's dumping on the people of Western Sydney and must not go ahead the points just be made it can be a key issue in this election campaign it's robbie money from infrastructure but is badly needed we do not need this project under any circumstances having the vision having the vision for transport for the 21st century high-speed rail it is there it is ready to go this is where that seed money from the airport should be directed and I did just want to concentrate on the World Heritage listing I'm so pleased to see he's me over here and deeply congratulate him for all that worker went over decades to get this listing and the howler government was warned warned about the threat to the World Heritage listing if this proposal Badgerys Creek Airport went ahead so we knew that the country knew that this should project should never have been put up and it's not just a matter of flight paths whatever the flight paths are very serious in the way they are structured but whichever way the planes come in they park and it's World Heritage listing we can't risk that remember where you live where I visit this area is a second most visited area in New South Wales and the Blue Mountains National Park is the most visited park in Australia that reputation would to be trashed overnight if this Airport goes ahead these planes would be dumping fuel the particular put pollution would simply be unacceptable the noise pollution would turn your lives in a misery and all those unique species that habitat in the Blue Mountains National Park would be trashed in a way that we have never seen before in a national park in this country the evidence is in our job now is to go forward start those conversations over your Christmas dinner you can start this conversation I'm not one for injecting politics into Christmas but seriously this is the time we've got the case we've got the evidence you've heard about what would happen to school children you know about your own lives you know what would happen to the reputation of this area it cannot happen actions show my deep concerns about this e is for the last two months I've stood on railway stations handing out flyers organised public forums in the lower and upper mountains written to PNC's and how wonderfully they've responded door knocked at weekends lobbied lagger colleagues alongside senator doug cameron who sends his apologies tonight is on parliamentary business interstate and I've stored with my community to raise people's awareness about the horrifying prospect that has been put to us but in case there is any doubt let me make it clear I am opposed to this Airport and Chinese it's not just the fly which surely must be an ambit claimed by government don't it's not just the lack of curfew it's not just the threat to world heritage which as a state and nation with pledge chills protector now it's not the lack of a railing from day one and some weird belief at the end for the guitar will cope with the traffic it's not just the lack of detail in the EIS which means sewing is the way in which the Turnbull government tried to slip this under the radar as we head towards Christmas holidays to promise community consultation and then to offer none to refuse to extend deadlines in spite of the thousands of people who have signed my petition and other community activists petitions pleading for that that they seriously thought they would get away with one single to our information session providing glossy brochures staffed by under-equipped marketing people who really you just had to feel sorry for and I bet they'd wished for Dave urged the danger money when they decided to come up to the mountains contrast this to Labour's approach when there was consideration of opening the RAF base at Richmond to civilian flights before an EIS was even thought of there was a large public meeting at Windsor in which senior bureaucrats from the department came and wait for it answered people's questions they sat in a big room and took as many questions as needed to be asked and provide what answers they could at that very early stage of a process that our concerns got dismissed as a community I believe that our actions over the last two months and our response to the EIS show that no government can take us for granted those of you who were here tonight you've been involved in the campaign today you know what you've done and if this government thinks that the deadline for the ER e is marks the end of our opposition they don't know us they don't know the blue mountains thank you most of the comments regarding flight paths and merge points and impact are solely related to the lower mountains the upper Blue Mountains flight path is horrific it will impact the upper mountains it doesn't kick in until the second runway comes into being but it needs to be in the draft EIS it really does and also in sorry I've lost my place here on the same vein in on page 15 under de recommendations and point six of the with the proposal editor the Minister for infrastructure and regional development were in trust in these business papers seeking assurance that above the lower Blue Mountains shown in the short term flight plan of flight paths will be ruled out it does not include the upper mountains flight paths and it must include those because these flight paths if this is is approved with those flight paths those flight paths can be used and if it rules out the lower mountains then it can use the upper mountains and I do acknowledge they are indicative only but they still will be available to be used thank look I want to address the whole issue of the people which is community is being held or the federal government in their bottoms 50 years ago that's all 15 years ago or knock on the head the hell again for a house degrees and set was very good on that 50 in their 50 years the boffins they gave us a set on the edge they put them now creates illusions about Cindy's western cities transport problems now if you choose to think of our high-speed rail they sat on their hands and waited for the propitious and let me go moment it's in front of us it's inevitable as soon as I'm done houses the berghoff media you know is limited you want the truth or you're in use limited they have known ed pocket of help you or 11 any of the equators I'm a one- down there in western sydney by if they have done nothing but cheap swap nazir for as high as you nibble you can't stop you have no power it's coming suckering too bad you people if we decided an ill or was up their side oh we're going to actually yeah we need to consumption we got a consumption when they say is they're going we're going to hear now well I'm going to consult I'm ganache Cara want your answer left we do you accept this airport as it is presently configured we got the people of interest rate me clear up if they food and they might they are being a project and the the black box and I cook them out of the heritage site or down out of is is why see her time because that's what she's fighting for supporting put them somewhere else because you click again to watch a mercy to mention asleep let me shine I'll play there this consultation this consultation is going to send it right back but what I want I want to quote something bromley is and it's on it called in gray hair of guesses and it's a wireless Prince printer this whole thing and that is this Airport hardly has any a absolutely wishes water with no point one percent of carbon emissions company table of course that only counts step one and two missions what happens on natural granite or digitally it's going to be a year quite right now for any more now this is about the emission kilogram but if you count placing 2.5 million times on this you do it to me a reasonable you may recall at the last Blue Mountain City Council extraordinary meeting on Thursday the fifth of November 2015 I spoke in opposition to the then agenda number two recommendations to three and five voted for all the recommendations at that meeting it was as I expected and that's fine by me I'm here tonight again to speak in opposition to the council's proposed submission as it currently stands the council's proposed mission is missing a key and compelling argument against the proposed Western Sydney Airport I know council could and should do better at prosecuting its case on the thirtieth of november I sent my own hard copy submission to the Australian Government Department of infrastructure and regional development Western Sydney unit and a few days later confirmed where the staff member it had been received the key point I made in my own submission is as follows the success of the proposed Western Sydney Airport is critically dependent upon the aviation industry continuing to access abundant and affordable aviation fuels evidence shown in my submission indicates this is unlikely to be maintained much beyond this decade perhaps sooner unless new effective affordable abundant sources of compatible aviation fuels and or alternate energy fuel propulsion technologies are developed and deployed extensively before 20 30 diamonds scale of task constraints globalpost peak oil regime high-speed rail like the one proposed by beyond zero missions has a far greater potential to thrive and prosper whereas aviation as it is currently configured is likely to wither substantially unless new effective technologies are urgently developed and deployed last time I address council I recommended you look at my submission number 36 to the Australian Senate inquiry into Australia's transporting g resilience and sustainability and my april nine public hearing testimony recorded enhancer on the australian parliament website to gain an overview of the looming energy security challenges it seems many politicians including counselors here appear to me I'm willing to acknowledge our looming energy security challenges it's perhaps why councils proposed submission is less compelling than I believe it could be last Thursday I emailed to me a green hill and council a copy of my draft submission concerning the proposed Western Sydney Airport I believe the information contained therein should be employed to supercharge councils proposed submission I think we all agree that the proposed Western Sydney Airport is an inappropriate enormously costly mistake that is highly unlikely to arguments I urge all councillors here to read this information presented and amend council submissions accordingly they compose the westerns in the airport thank you support high speed rail initiatives you know it makes sense all right I really am under qualified to add much too many of the people who've already spoken tonight so I'm going to keep it very short just to say that the Greens commit to through the election campaign and to every other means available to us supporting this council and this this movement to prevent the building of this Airport I just want to make a couple of points one is I wholeheartedly endorse Chris Tobin's first speech I work with indigenous students at worse in Sydney University many of them there are people and I know that that the boro people have a word for this country for their country which is in Laura and Nora means not just your camp or your home but your spiritual home and that Badgerys Creek area Christine mentioned this that Badgerys Creek area is full of indigenous sites and relics and these are I also want to just raise a little little word of caution or alarm if you like and that is that I've also like Susan been handing out literature on railway stations lately and I'm getting an overwhelming support from most people of vast majority of people very little dissent from the idea that this Airport should be stopped but what I am getting is quite a lot of pessimism from people people saying oh it's a done deal we can't do anything about it and I think that's the thing that we really need to tackle in this campaign we need to convince people that it is not a nun deal and this gathering here tonight indicates very clearly that we can do something about it and I just want to finish by saying I am against this Airport and so is my party as a community we have a moral obligation to protect and preserve our societal values environment health and amenity actually that's the role of government but they have a history of making pretty bad decisions and this one's people to stop them frankly being downed it was community to stop the destruction of the rocks precinct in Sydney Cove and it was community that stopped the Badgers Creek Airport in 1998 the Southwest Sydney basin has got to be the dumbest place in the world for an airport but more than that a second Airport is just not needed even with an hourly cap and a curfew Sydney operates the day with forty percent excess capacity Sydney Airport will not reach a perceived maximum capacity for another two decades yes I would Justice I'd like to say imagine if we had an innovative and smart government one that was thinking beyond planes and couldn't embrace trains that argument we put forward more eloquently me earlier on the Western Sydney Airport is designed to cater for 82 million passengers a year and that's nice to see the size of Sydney Airport and today that would make it to third largest airport on the planet it will it will be the largest earthmoving project since its snowy mountain scheme not sure people realize that it will take hills of the South Western Sydney basin this is an absolute destruction waiting to happen can we trust the government on flight path sure mr. trust tells us they are only indicative but he'll get back to us in 2025 with airport with airspace to the east already occupied by Sydney the West is the only way to go there was no avoiding fly pass over our communities our drinking water catchment areas in our world heritage National Park but don't despair my friends in 1998 EIS failed the professional and public scrutiny test and the current tendentious and shabby is is heading in the very same direction the idea is fundamentally unsound and no amount of marketing material can dress it up we the community are rising and we will be heard buckle up friends this is a long campaign and failure is not an option talk to family talk to friends contact your local elected representatives and federal and state but above all act and act now have your voice heard write your submission do it and do it now for our community thank you I I've read the environmental impact statement and other fact sheets spruiking the benefits of the airport at Badgerys Creek unlike mascot where the flights approach in all different directions distributing the noise amongst everyone the and I only arrived between 6am and 11pm every flight coming into Badgerys Creek will merge 24 hours a day just 1,300 meters about Blaxland there will be a virtual airport just 1300 less than one kilometer or just they won't let me write about Blaxland the report claims that this will result in a noise level of 60 decibels over Blaxland however it gives no indication of where this fear comes from or what it means it has literally been plucked out of the air I have been investigating some facts about noise levels myself I found that the consensus is that a Boeing 737 at 1850 not 1318 50 meters produces 90 decibels of sound not 60 but 90 not much of a difference only fifty percent difference no because of the log scale that difference will be eight times louder than they're claiming it will be rather than conversational seven and a half meters or a lawnmower believe me when a plane comes over you won't hear your neighbor mowing their lawn these numbers are literally pie in the sky so at the moment we have no idea what to expect no one knows what to expect the first indication of what the noise will be like will be 3 a.m. one morning in 20-25 when the first flight arrives by that time it will actually be a bit too late to stop the airport now why hasn't someone chartered a 747 and flown it over the proposed flight paths at 3am of course this will enable the voters of the marginal seats of Western Sydney to have a chance to hear what we're in for and what is the government trying to hide there's also talk of improving tourism I don't know whether they're planning on having the businessman who arrives at eight at 5am on his way to a city all the way Circa meeting in the center of Sydney I don't know whether they're expecting him to pop quietness and wonder what it used to be like or are they expecting the family of four people just arrived from a 24 hour flight from North America or Europe to lug all their luggage up to the top of the Blue Mountains just for the fun of it despite jet lag and everything else I'll be suffering thank you very much thank you I was having a cup of tea this afternoon thinking about all of this and for very loud noisy disruptive horrible planes flew over about within a space of twenty minutes I had to close that we know it's a hot day I didn't want to do that this is about our lives our everyday lives this is happening now imagine what's to come you see this is about people this is about you and me this is about our futures I not only move to the Blue Mountains five years ago for a life a quality of life a beautiful quality of life I also invested in a livelihood I had the temerity to invest and to make plans to have the city and enjoy serenity and quietness in the beautiful Blue Mountains bush let me tell you a little retreat on the weekend in Laura about 150 200 people had come from all over New South Wales we were outside enjoying the bush and of course the comment inevitably came what is it with these planes and then over our organic vegetarian lunch that day a few people made the comment or one person made the common you know what I've heard there's another retreat place in so-and-so of town it's really quiet someone said could you give me the name of that this is now imagine what's to come I'm hosting friends at the moment a young fellow from Sweden a lovely girl from America young energetic they went into wentworth falls I said give us the hardest walk you can find though and all the way down to the bottom not know not just have all the way down they camped overnight good on them they survived they had a great time and they came back how was it they said we've it was the most beautiful we've ever done I was as pleased as punch I was so proud they said but what is it with those planes we couldn't see anything but beautiful bush we came for serenity we wanted to get away and yet they were there they've cut short their visit they'll go somewhere else to hike this is now imagine what's to come I've got a proposal for that this is going to affect everyone not just us small people but it's going to affect everyone I want to invite the tourism industry to get on board we wear as it began to town here were the big players the hojo majestic and their friends will be impacted the fairmont resort all of those big resorts those local people now putting in their money to get posters and printing done out of their own money we need these big corporate organizations who will also be impacted we've also made huge investments we need them to get on board we need them to get on board now and put their so they need to be end it together with us all together speaking of which if this does happen we need to go down to Beaudry's Creek when the bulldozers come Chris can help us set up a camp and when to sit there we like to camp we're used to the cold and we'll sit there and camp out and make sure that this doesn't happen and stop those bulldozers just for the benefit of everyone here Ross Costa has been driving our response and each of us were given a different section of the EIS to comment on the section that I was given was a preliminary bird and bat strike assessment and this forms the hazards and risk and the biodiversity assessment components of the draft EIS now I'm speaking directly from the biologist report here why bird and bat strike is an issue since nineteen twelve 120 aircraft having been destroyed due to both bird strike incidents with 60 of those incidents leading to the deaths of 297 people bird strikes costume commercial aviation industry and an estimated us 1.2 billion to the Convention on International Civil Aviation Australia has international obligations regarding a regulation and management of aviation safety Australians evil asian nations safety legislation includes provisions to meet Australia's international obligations under the civil aviation safety regulations Act of nineteen ninety eight imposes an obligation on airports to reduce the risk of wildlife strikes they had some consultant biologists involved they were only given in three days to do their scope survey they did a desktop review of legislation requirements and other information they were given one day to survey birds and bats and flying foxes at the airport site then under international standards they also surveyed two days in the surrounding 25 kilometer radius of the airport site which they required to do their preliminary finding they did actually bind birds that are higher risk you're being sued birds like angle ours and Magpies and so forth birds that flock or a high risk they did find those bird species in the in the surveys that they did and they considered it would be a high risk of obstructive escape the airport side and that the certain extent throughout their report they have lathe layered at with further assessment required to confirm their to confirm their findings so it's very limited data they only did that data in a collection in March there was no seasonal data known nocturnal data there was a significant gap in this so they did not survey the war again birdemic catchment area Lake Bergeron areas of the greater Blue Mountains National Park order each area and parts Olympian river that refill within that 25 kilometer radius area the mitigation strategies they said they weren't able to give any details for that because there wasn't in enough details about the airport design and construction flight paths it's elves 93% of bird strikes occur below three thousand three hundred fifty feet were again madam is at 2,250 feet so so the flight path as it's currently designed would being planes very low down there so there's a very big risk there also biodiversity risk in those areas so there's a series of Judea care issue here by the Australian Government and they should not improve the biologists also grid further inflate this x x x I'm a an engineer and specializing in aerospace noise the good professor here pretty much hit thing on the head I just like to say the government's EIS is dishonest with respect to noise in so many ways I'll go into details not in this about here anybody wants I'll tell them the actual probable noise levels are going to would be a hundred times larger than what they are reporting in the EIS I'll leave it at that I moved to glenbrook 32 years ago to bring up my children in a quiet environment one that you didn't have to smell the fumes of where my parents still live and I thought that I would be able to live here in a quiet and environment and non smelly one so I'm disappointed that they've already started building this airport and the transport there's no forward thinking at all as to putting this Airport in no forward thinking as to the health of the people of the Blue Mountains and the can mean we're starting to hear them now and it hasn't even really been fully impacted so I'm really disappointed and like everybody else I think we should get together and just keep fighting so that's all I have to say thank you if it does go ahead I will end up being a former resident of the blue mountains and essentially would like to know from the federal government where I can send the the check for my moving expenses and that's pretty much it there's been plenty of data given out but I just wanted to sort of say from a long-term blue mountains resident how it used to be in 1972 when I moved here I was a little girl I was seven and there were no brown or dark flies there were bright winged creatures that used to flying through the screen door 25 or 30 of them in 30 seconds flat mom used to yell at me to shut the door really quickly because of all the beautiful creatures that used to come in my brother used to say wake me up in morning at 5am there was 500 parrots out the front you know we used to be used to sit there and laugh at their green frogs in in the in the inner drains and the strange noises that they made at night and it wasn't just the green frogs there was about ten different species I used to look at all the beautiful cockatoos that we had in the myriad of species and and we've spent our lives running barefoot through out clear streams and beautiful country we had yabbies we had trout we had everything now even without the airport I'm already broken hearted as a stolen generation to send it to see the damage has been already done to the blue mountains we are already struggling to keep this place as it should be we've lost fifty percent of our wildlife across the world in the last forty years people this kind of development is not sustainable we need to keep some precious places for people to be able to commune with nature both first nations and and pen and home we need to have that Center and I think that that should be preserved thank you very much I'm not going to say anything that's much different from that's already been said but I'll just come from the position that I came from marrickville in Sydney the fly path was more than evident albeit there was a curfew at eleven o'clock but I used to tell people that when the planes flew over my house when the wheels went down flies used to catch a lift to mascot that's how close it was my whole house shook it woke my children at night and woke me at night there was problems with the air quality and all these things that you've heard from better more expert people than myself I'm saying to myself here we go again and I'm absolutely despairing but I'm not giving up either so on urging all of you to keep on with the good fight this project if it goes ahead will impact on social quality environmental quality the Penrith basin and all the all of Australia imagine what's going to happen if this goes ahead and that's just one of the issues the issues are multiple and it's no good saying 20 years down the track oh let's see what we can do about mitigating these problems that have happened let's not mitigate let's just stop it now keep fighting I came here I was living in bryn jelly which is quite close to the Badgerys Creek Airport and I lived on a five acre bush bak and the birds there were amazing you wouldn't you wouldn't believe how many birds were in such a residential area and this is part of the Cumberland planes bushland which is endangered and it's known that it's endangered and this Airport will just continue to destroy the column planes bushland um also being a resident of spring would of course destroy all of our lives in the AIS they talk about numbers and impacts of Norreys compared to background noise but I don't think they take into account context and the difference between a background background of noise that consists of city traffic I think it's vastly different and I don't think that he is takes that into account at all and so I human tlie oppose this Airport thank you there's been so really eloquent speakers tonight expressing the concerns and raising a lot of facts and validated research about the e is so I've decided not to go there tonight I don't think my knowledge would match their knowledge so I'm speaking off the cuff I want to tell you a little bit about how I'm feeling because maybe that'll resonate with a lot of you and the reason why I'm telling you this is because I'm sure what I'm feeling in my heart is probably also what's feeling in your heart as well so bear with me if I bore you and this isn't about myself but it's about how I feel and I think how you feel I'm a different person and I was six weeks ago I was pretty carefree happy you're going about because when you've been here for so long you just accept that's the part of of what you're you're living in so I sort of don't like how I've become because the happy carefree person is becoming a person that's full of anxiety a little bit of depression and very scared snappy at the children at the family because I'm just engulfed in in this feeling that I'm losing something something very precious to me and I want to let you all know that probably what I'm feeling is what you're feeling and I'm really empathize with how all of you must be going through and the community that are not here tonight when something is threatened whether it's your health or someone's sick in the family or your lifestyle it's very frightening and you have a lot of fear and you do you become a different person so I think probably to overcome back is for all of us to to realize that we're not alone in this and that we all support counsel have your back and I'm just blown away to think that there's so many people up here tonight different political affiliations but they're coming together and they're putting that aside and they're up there empathizing with us too and they're saying let's get together as a community let's fight this and let's let's put whether you want the airport or not want the airport aside and just rally together to to come together to say this is wrong community is only becomes community I think when you unite usually we're quite individual but I just wanna say one more thing just one more little thing I want to apologize to the indigenous people because for the very first time in my life I have a little taste of what it feels like to have something taken away from you you
As you all know the australian government released that draft eis in mid-october and as you all know that draft EIS is supposed to look at potential impacts on the community and the environment the problem is it doesn't it simply doesn't do what it was meant to do instead as Bob Davis said tonight it reads as a catalogue of errors the most glaring of which I bring to your attention and the attention of the council as I've said publicly previously there is nothing but uncertainty at every turn when it comes to the CIS and quite frankly the lack of detail in the document is outs town is astounding you would not let us get away with something like that with some of the decisions we have to make if we presented a report to you with a lack of detail that's in this you would not let us get away with it key issues little things that might be relevant to an airport like aircraft noise flight paths because they're indicative only traffic maybe should write a bit of an analysis the environment might be something that perhaps the government could have turned its mind to potentially negative economic impacts might have registered a thought but all of these have been either ill-considered or poorly addressed in that joke of a document we refer to as a draft EIS that draft that draft is nothing but a rush job a con job and a shankh job and it does not even meet the government's own guidelines for an EIS did you know it was done in just eight months when the last one took two and a half years does that indicate that maybe it was done according to a political timeline rather than in the is timeline is this just another captain's call that should go the way of knights and dames I wonder we knew it was vast tract and this has now been proven by the joke of a document that we've been handed and by the independent review that was undertaken by where's rock and by this council and which is before you tonight both have identified numerous blatant omissions some of which you folks the council also believes that 60 days to respond to an EIS is not long enough it is not long enough to consider such a complex document that can have such dramatic impacts on our community and as Council of Phil said memorably at our last meeting we gave you more with green bins this is sloppy and it shows frankly a complete disregard for you and for the rest of the people in western Sydney I don't support any airport at Badgerys Creek and I never will I came here how long ago Daniel all right long long time ago a cut I was elected a long long time ago I think it must be 16 years ago and we opposed it then we oppose it now lock stock and barrel it's a bad idea and it should never happen as has been said tonight there's been no attempt at all to model or test different flight path options which get this the australian government's own guidelines say annie is should do they didn't do it they should have done it according wonders why and we know that noise impacts were not even taken into consideration when they plan the current flight paths or they wouldn't have them sitting 4,000 feet above our community residential impacts not discussed mitigation measures not quantified the merge point a new term places an unfair burden on the people of the Blue Mountains and must be not reviewed eradicated we just cannot have an airport operating like this one 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year placing a burden on you and our environment it is not on and I want to ask you this question why should one Sydney Airport bear the burden of a curfew and not another as counselor luchetti said last time we were here is it that the bogans don't deserve a curfew is that what it's about I'd prefer to say the hippies but that's just me I feel more like a hippie than a bogan if you get that on one of my three phones Robert the experts also tell us that the entire review of all flight movements conducted you'd think that was pretty obvious didn't happen we also know the ISS based as Libby said and this is where the upper mountains come into it and she's dead right there based on the first five years of operation stage one only have a look at stage two when they put in that second runway and that second more hideous merge point appears above the upper mountains and that's why we say in this submission no way is can be properly considered when it only deals with stage one because what it does is it ignores I'd say deliberately the impacts on the upper Blue Mountains not on these government officials focus on the predicted passenger levels when they're at their lowest in the first five years equal to an airport the size of Townsville but and Libby made the point when the second runner when the second runway and passenger numbers are at their peak around 80 million passenger movements annually 80 million passenger movements annually we're dealing with an airport busier than Heathrow and more like Dubai not analyzed a mega Airport to our doorstep without giving us the facts that we need to make a proper assessment of its likely impacts now the Deputy Prime Minister and I want to spend some time on him if I may I'm not a fan I shan't vote for him the Deputy Prime Minister argues that these flight paths are only preliminary and indicative he has said that there will be an opportunity as has been said tonight to review these flight paths in eight years time just before the airport scheduled to start operations go back to the barricades don't campaign it's ok just before the planes start flying and after it's built then we'll look at these flight paths and then we'll make an assessment about whether or not they're just indicative or real don't know about you but I'm not feeling too comfortable now everybody I'm not one to treat with rumors anybody who knows me knows I hate gossip shut up councillors but if the rumors are right and sometimes they are the Deputy Prime Minister looking to announce his retirement from politics in January how can someone in the departure lounge of Parliament guarantee there'll be another opportunity for comment I'm not feeling confident ladies and gentlemen and there is no such statement in the is either about his retirement or indeed about the fact that we get another say just before the planes start flying not in the e is not feeling confident so can you imagine the time ax built the buildings are constructed the lights and everything of dazzling away planes are humming on the tarmac getting ready for that first day of operations and then they're going to consult with about it flight paths are not thinking that is something we should accept tourism surprisingly one operator thinks that I'm a socialist and they're right is one of our largest industries and it is the economic powerhouse of this region it is the lifeblood of our small businesses to in the year 2 jun 2015 we had three and a half million visitors to our mountains and they spent over half a billion dollars here the is estimated to be at over 195 million dollars with thirteen percent of our jobs thirteen percent based on tourism with other key sectors such as retail trade being dependent on tourism millions of people from across the planet come here to Australia to visit our special and unique place with its outstanding values we are one of only two cities in the world two cities in the whole world within a world listed area and the Blue Mountains National Park has the highest visitation of any national park in Australia our towns our community depend on tourism and whether it's visiting a health spa whether it's bushwalking whether it's camping people will be forced to choose people will be forced to choose whether they pursue these activities under a flight path or select a quieter location elsewhere you and I go back away a long way and I'm going to take your point because you are right as you often are always are who will come and camp under a flight path that operates 24 7 we know that the number of visitors to this we were here we know it will decrease if we lose it the EIS states that there will be no real impacts on the visitors to the greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area that is a lie I'm getting a cogs my voice keeps going up in a punch out there right that is a lie and that's a lie based on the DBA noise levels alone but this assertion does not consider the way in which people use the National Park we know you all know it's the natural quiet that people expect to experience when they visit an international research shows what we already know that recreational park users value than actual quiet and as a result are more sensitive to noise intrusion experiencing the natural natural quiet is part of the visitor experience to the Blue Mountains and a 2011 us study found that ninety-five percent of respondents thought providing a natural quiet environment where the sounds of nature were dominant was the important factor in visiting a national park one of the greatest experiences I've had as mayor was to spend time of the key reasons our city was treated was chosen for a retreat for advanced Buddha's teaching by His Holiness was in recognition of this special beauty and tranquility you know that fact speaks to the value placed on the blue mountains globally that when the Dalai Lama was looking for somewhere to come for that retreat he picked here would he pick here with planes 24-7_._906.109 we can't afford to put this at risk and that's why I wonder when that person said that I shouldn't be doing this these people shouldn't all be doing this what they're talking about because this is their businesses to now noise impacts weren't really looked at as part of the is should have been may have occurred to the government to have a little look at that an additional research commissioned by your counsel suggests that when assessing aircraft noise intrusion in natural settings it is not appropriate to do this on the basis of noise levels alone noising quiet settings such as ours need to be understood in the context of that quiet soundscape the soundscape is different and we get the low level the low level noise because the planes are landing and frequent low-level noise occurrences and natural settings also need to be taken into consideration were not the e is found or has been found to wanting when it comes to the impacts on wildlife the EIS has claimed that wildlife will become desensitized to noise the calls won't mind the wallabies will not worry after a couple of months nor will the bird life we've had a look and we've identified more recent research actually research than that which was laughably used in the e is and what it shows is that an increase in noise levels leads to changes in animal behavior and changes in animal distribution guess what it also shows it also shows that rises in background noise for animals can lead to an impact on the masking of signals for communication navigation prey detection predator avoidance and environmental monitoring it is just rubbish to say that the animals will get used to it it would be wrong of a mare to say publicly reckon air quality is important but the EIS doesn't air quality at both the local and regional level in a long term was identified in the draft EIS as a concern but something that all be passed over but levels exceed acceptable standards for nitrogen dioxide PM 2.5 PM 10 which is particulate matter and I'm very worried with some phd's in the room when I say this and ozone for example air quality as has been said tonight is already a major concern for Western Sydney this Airport is going to impact on that it's going to impact on that dramatically and to pass it over and gloss it over actually puts people's health at risk as has been said tonight and that is inexcusable in 1999 whether it was last talk of an airport at Badgerys Creek the World Heritage listing nomination did you know was deferred as a direct result did you know that we ought we know that UNESCO had very serious concerns about the potential impacts of an airport on what is now the greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area draft EIS and they pose a real threat they did then they will now the natural quiet the visual spectacle are important characteristics of our region and UNESCO cited both of these as important when a granted World Heritage status the draft the is states at noise levels below 50 DPA and the greater world heritage National Park are not significant well colleagues well we think otherwise we think this statement is rubbish we think this Dame it has not been sufficiently justified and in fact it represents significant and widespread impact on the world heritage area its kado and unesco thought so in 1999 as bob davis said tonight only two years ago we celebrated the 15-year anniversary of the World Heritage listing I hope we get to celebrate it in 15 years time council last week welcomed the news that the new south wales government is in the final stage of approving the blue mountains local environment plan a blueprint document that guides land use across the city we didn't think we'd get there but we did and the new LEP and the staff over there put together that nearly didn't get there the new LEP will continue to protect and manage many of the special characteristics of the natural and built environment of the Blue Mountains which are clearly valued by all of you only to be threatened by this airport why do we bother one glad be bothered well every one of you here tonight each person knows and understands what an exceptionally beautiful place the Blue Mountains is you know and understand why it needs to be preserved and protected for everyone to enjoy every one of you knows that but equally important this is also our place in which we live in which we work it's a place of economic enterprise it's a place where ordinary people families and community go about their daily lives and it is the place of our first peoples as a council we say this the draft EIS is grossly inadequate considering that the Western Sydney Airport is the most significant proposal affecting the livability of Western Sydney for the next century we say this the minister for the environment should reject the draft approved we say this that we will be assessing our opposition to the significant and irreversible impacts on the Blue Mountains environment and on our community that will occur if this thing goes ahead and we will not stop fighting we say this that the Minister for the environment the Honorable Greg Hunt needs to seek advice from UNESCO now regarding the potential impacts of this proposition on our world heritage area and we say this we will be endorsing the submission made by the first peoples of the city of blue mountains through the aboriginal advisory council and supporting it fully and we say this isn't good enough and quite frankly both the Blue Mountains and although some councils in western Sydney don't want to speak up for their communities we will Western Sydney should not have this Airport thank you Western Sydney Airport will have no curfew unlike mascot which means the old and nausea freight planes were using this Airport 24 hours 7 days a week 365 days a year if Western Sydney Airport cannot be built without its flight paths impacting over the Blue Sydney airports then this site is not really suitable for an airport much has been said about the lack of rail transport in western Sydney Airport initially ever rail can play an important role in reducing demand for air transport a present Melbourne Canberra and Brisbane are the only interstate destinations that can be conveniently reached by rail from Sydney however a4ai a.m. arrival timing Brisbane is not really user-friendly while the whom the hume federal and now the pacific highways have seen major reconstruction projects the corresponding rail routes to these cities have only have only seen minor improvements and still follow steam age alignments with speed restrictions the rail line from maitland of Brisbane is largest single track of passing alerts when the hume highway between macarthur and meadow gan and Goulburn and yes were tree rooted opportunities were missed also reroute parts of the Sydney Melbourne rail line and these new new alignments and quite actually the line between Goulburn and Goldman yes actually is good for Lawrence or photographers course if it's lovely curves you can be really nice shots of trains most Kurds okay travelers over the last 30 years there have been proposals for a very fast train from city in the Melbourne my camera which would slash the travel time through in Sydney and Melbourne to a little over three hours Herbert the peace process is not about the drawing board as successive governments are taken fright at the high cost of providing this technology however there is an alternative which is tilt trying technology this technology has been braced by the queensland government for its north coast railway line from brisbane de cannes if a tilt train technology couple of track and alignment improvements was used on a sydney melbourne route the trouble time could be reduced to a little over six hours instead of almost eleven that you can actually drive to melbourne with breaks in nine and a half hours from glenbrook another another thing to consider is what we got no guarantee what a future government made dual Kingsford Smith I mean the site's worth a lot of money actually what's to stop a future government actually closing Kingsford Smith and moving all air operations at Kingsford Smith could easily be adapted to other users that's something we're going to consider there's no guarantee what a future government may do with Kingsford Smith airport in conclusion a 24 24 hour seven airport at Badgerys Creek will have a negative impact on Blue Mountains residents through noise pollution effects on sleep and the effects of aircraft emissions as we know this Airport is planned to be right next door to us and our world heritage area I might actually wait a moment just stop at one o'clock back to five if we would the seconder has the call Thank You mr. mayor I will start from the beginning thanks for all your for your attendance tonight and thanks for all the wonderful speeches that we've heard already I don't think I can really add much but I do want to talk about a couple of things first the airport as we all know is right next door to us and our world heritage area for me the box that says will not adversely affect a World Heritage Area is the first all know the draft EIS does not kick that box it pays lip service to that box as we also know people work very hard over a very long period to gain world heritage status for us that listing is not lightly bestowed and as we know it can be lost it can be removed from us so that that listing here should be treated in the Cavalier manner in which it has been treated by the e is I think is simply outrageous outrageous we have it is our responsibility we've been given the responsibility to look after that land to care for it to maintain it and that responsibility is right at the top of our list of responsibilities it's not the only thing at the top but it's at the top and there is no development that is so important that that responsibility can be ignored or downgraded so for me that is straight off an automatic no to the draft EIS and no to the airport my second point is a little diversion I'd like to take a short tour through the is based I I suspect like many of you have quite a deep instinctive distrust of predictions that stretch out for anything more than about 10 years call me cynical anyway and now I have to thank jeff bennett who is I believe still in the room for providing me with a deal of the following information now the draft EIS uses the Sydney Airport master plan from 2009 and the 2012 joint study on aviation capacity in the sydney region that's the basis it uses to tell us that we are going to need another airport the master plan that is done in 2015 which is in fact the latest much more recent master plan has a different has different figures altogether for instance its prediction of growth by 2029 which is the same point that the 2009 master plan went to its prediction is fifteen fifteen percent lower in terms of aircraft movements than the 2009 master plan was it says this is made primarily because of the GFC it forecasts an annual aircraft movement growth of one-point-four percent and it concludes that Sydney Airport does in a reality check on that the latest passenger aircraft movement figures this is the sum of arrivals and departures at Sydney between jun 2014 and jun 2015 grew by 0.1 percent 0.1 this is even with the 2015 master plan saying it predicted one-point-four percent the previous one predicted about three-point-four percent so even with a lower prediction of 1.4 the facts are still 0.1 you will not be surprised that I remain distrustful of the predictions for Sydney Airport that or the predictions that Sydney Airport will be full and there will be no possibility of growth and we will need another airport no not going for it and that's without discussing whether there will be any you know increase in oil prices or recessions or any other things like that that might affect it so I think I will in fact pretty much stopped there on the for me amongst all the other things that people have said all of with all of which I agree with the World Heritage Area being something non is entirely non-negotiable for me the need for a second Airport is very those two things from me you get no Airport Thank You mr. mayor we are a community of individuals and it is we the people that we are able to make a difference throughout this entire process our community has been United and we have stood firm despite despite the different political banners mcfly this is the only way that we will receive any outcome I've said this before and I'll say it again the Blue Mounds community has been let down by the bureaucrats of the Department of infrastructure and regional development dick the cambro machines planned flight paths merging over Blaxland are complete betrayal and we shouldn't accept this and judging by tonight's Senate mr. mayor we don't I don't believe that the current EIS satisfies the need of the Blue Mounds community and in particular my residence award for the residents of Ward 4 will bear the brunt of this burden and it is unacceptable it is unacceptable that the Canberra machine believes that it can just dump this e is in our laps and will accept it it is unacceptable do it's unfortunate to read the deputy prime minister's statement about our concerns on this issue it looks good to begin with it reads well says nice promising things then slowly evolves from a promising story about addressing our concerns and changing flight paths to taking a more Stephen King approach thank you the mayor the main issue I have with the Deputy Prime Minister statement is just one line one line ruined it all and I quote I canna shoot assure you that the government will work with the community and listen to its concerns before settling the flight paths and a spate airspace management arrangements which will occur nearer to when the airport commences services mr. mayor this is a statement from a Nationals MP that is contemplating his retirement he won't be here when the flight path will be determined again instead the Deputy Prime Minister should instruct his bureaucrats in his department to fix this mess that they created and he can retire with a clear conscience and I conclude mr. man that bad government caused this to happen bad government will continue like those that have thrust the sea is upon us have failed to stand up for the interests of their own people and it is up to us the community to stop the camera machine because Marcus said everything can I totally agree with what he said in he's an elegant squeaker I'm going to go change that my tactical a little bit and I want to talk about the airport layout and what indicative means when you read through the report on you read through the e is everything is indicative the draft EIS yarn for stage 1 and when the government or the bureaucrats decide who the ALC is the airport least company's going to be is it going to be the present operators of the Kingsford Smith air port macquarie bank and what impact will they have because not only are the flight paths indicative also the runways that we've only got one at the present moment the south west north east runway layout what are they going to do what input will the a or c have through this whole process we Minister and I was at that meeting when he virtually said that to me that we will look at the do a complete newly is for the flight paths and I have since been informed that they do that on a regular basis about every five years the flight paths are looked at 44 Kingsford Smith but in this whole process you've got four airports got a military one you've got bangs down you've got Camden you got Kingsford Smith the flight paths were just made to see whether the airport would work and this concerns me because they haven't looked the whole of the Sydney basin we are going to become 24 Badgerys Creek is going to become 24-7 and at a meeting in Sydney of Sydney sorry the Sydney Airport forum a question was asked and I didn't know this of the people from Air Services who look after the flight paths about the airport curfew did you know that the airport curfew is in legislation and that legislation says when Badgers Creek is open that Kingsford Smith will no longer take any anything like that they all have to go to Bajor escape that's what the legislation says so this is unfair to the rhythms of the of the Blue Mountains look Marcus basically said everything I am opposed to it I will be forever in a day I move to the mountains in the early 70s I have raised my family here and I have lived here and I've run my business here this is my home a quiet part of the world I moved out of Parramatta to come here I want to keep it that way and I will do everything in my power to carry on doing it that way good afternoon ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking we are approaching the blackfin merge point and we'll be touching down at Western Sydney Airport in less than five minutes on disembarking the aircraft you may be surprised to learn that there is in fact no rail link to the sydney CBD and you'll need to make that 65 kilometers Ernie viroid as best you can never mind the guy the government is can more efficiently congest the motorways as you compete with the thousands of extra fuel tankers and now as we pass over Blaxland do continue to enjoy the breathtaking views of the former world heritage-listed blue mountains for those on the right-hand side of the aircraft you will be enjoying iconic views of the blue labyrinth and beyond to the sandstone cliffs of the jamison escarpment on the left-hand side of the aircraft you would normally have a perfect view of the once popular yoga clearing although it tends to be a little smoggy these days and now as we make our final turn over Sydney's once pristine water catchment area a timely reminder to stock up on bottled water cabin crew please be seated for landing mr. Muir what is proposed in this EIS is a disgrace we want birds not Boeing's over Blaxland we want fresh we want fresh air not Airbus's over our national park and we want quietness not conscious in our mountains whether we grew up in the mountains or choose to move here like I did most of us have a if we were living in the city and generally we expect to be able to enjoy a certain level of tranquility in and around our homes at all times of the day because we live within a national park it's known as amenity mr. Muir amenity in fact the draft eia has mentions the word amenity 321 times and also concedes that an airport would change the amenity of our communities and our recreational areas and that aircraft noise is one of the most sensitive issues well thank you captain obvious I'll conclude with a quick look at some of the reasons why other airport sites have been rejected in the past and proposed the question why then Badgerys Creek Tara point in Botany Bay ruled out environmental difficulties galston ruled out not environmentally feasible duffy's virus ruled out potential negative impact on Korean go chase National Park holsworthy ruled out possibility of contaminating woronora catchment area well guess what folks battery Creek site achieves the quinella close proximity to National Park and closer proximity to a water catchment area then then holsworthy add to this the environmental disaster make no mistake whatever proposal is chosen for flight paths that track over any part of the mountains we all lose residents tourists businesses the environment we will all be negatively impacted this is a mountains white issue and as such we must remain galvanized and United in opposing twenty-four-seven aircraft flight paths over the Blue Mountains and let Canberra no loud and clear this Airport won't fly so if it's not entirely obviously by now I support the motion let me begin by saying how stunned I am by the timing of this whole charade firstly we get a camera call of who's who announcing what great builders of infrastructure they are by announcing they're going to build an airport at Badgerys Creek the cart is now before the horse the horse being the EIS but we can't put back into champagne bottles can we so the area is is completed in record time and surprises no one by reporting that everything is awesome just to make sure that no one finds any problems with this warp speed endorsement the community is by my reckoning 4290 eight pages of a times highly technical information oh and do it in the lead-up to christmas and no we won't give you an extension even if this is a really significant development that as dramatic lifestyle ramifications for whole towns villages suburbs indeed a city do you get the feeling that they do not want any white noise that they are actively discouraging scrutiny we are alert and alarmed this is like having to read four volumes of Game of Thrones in two months without the sex and violence although there was plenty of horror there was plenty of horror and the violence will arrive as an assault on areas if this proposal proceeds in its current form our community has machine gun holes in the document it has been amended whilst under exhibition because of the Gunners in our ranks without question it should be revised and re exhibited our home is on unesco's world heritage list because if its outstanding universal value for its unique habitats and plant communities and recreation tourism wilderness scenic and aesthetic values the draft EIS concluded blue mountains World Heritage Area and it's world heritage values and at the airport in its operation would not result in attributes of the World Heritage Area being lost degraded damaged or notably altered modified obscured or diminished further that it would have no significant impact on recreation or tourism values this is creative writing pure fiction the authors clearly have no affinity for wilderness experiences or perhaps perhaps they live with Darryl Kerrigan such as their enthusiasm to diminish the impact of aircraft and aircraft noise on a landscape further it is suggested that 50 to 60 decibels is acceptable background noise in a wilderness area really a clifftop solitude at dawn and an Airbus at 1500 meters how gloriously meditative and here is the thing the lower mountains which is going to cop the brunt of the audiovisual assault and stage one was not even used in modeling of the impacts on sensitive areas in being told that everything will be fine in the Blue Mountains all the sights used to assess and model impacts are in the upper mountains it clearly escapes the authors that the ability to enjoy all the grandeur and beauty of the lower mountains has been completely overlooked this affects tourism to think glenbrook on a saturday all the bike riders returning from riding the woodford to glenbrook fire trail all the families who come up to enjoy a gathering at yer acre clearing think of all the trail runners bushwalkers picnickers and campers both local and tourists alike who loved the tranquility and beauty of the law mountains nature experience ruined and not even acknowledged or mentioned in the ais here's another gem there is little potential for the proposed airport to directly affect the aboriginal cultural values of the greater Blue Mountains area contrast sister Kristy burns views contrast this to the views of all the Daragon Gundam Garrett traditional owners of the land and the extent of the problems with this ticker box document truly start to emerge they found this is the traditional owners that the impacts of this proposal on both culture and country to be both distressing and disconcerting and they they 13 significant issues that they have with what is planned and they're concept reportedly best practice in Airways architecture tell that to the people who will be living underneath it on paper it looks like a water slide at wet and wild it if it comes into being over Blaxland the people will be deaf and wild or maybe deaf and tired councillors time has expired who conclude the flaws in this document have been well exposed our communities in our world heritage wilderness status are gravely threatened by the subjective conclusions drawn in the a is the test now lies with Minister hunt and Deputy Prime Minister trust who will receive this document they acknowledge those weaknesses and fundamental shortcomings and thus rejected outright thank you it's just absolutely appalling and the situation where these planes are going to be coming over here coming over Blaxland hitting that merge point at such a low altitude only 4,000 feet above the ground here supported by this incredible EIS which just has to be seen as an absolute farrago of fictions and that's the view not just of people who feel directly affected and who could be accused of some degree view and I speak as a director of the Western Sydney regional organization of councils which I'm a director of along with the counselor miles that organization employed a company to do a peer review of the EIS the company employed was Parsons Brinckerhoff and they had to of course provide information back to the two where's rock in a very short period of time where's rock then provided that information to the local councils the Constituent councils and that's now available to the public at various meetings employees of persons Brinkerhoff and associated consultants have just expressed absolute amazement the shortcomings have been quoted chapter and verse here I'm not going to go through them again we'd ask them a question you know what do they say about this and parsons brinckerhoff would say well they say this but it's really funny because we can't find out how it's supported there are no agreed modeling procedures have gone through the the models they've used have not necessarily been peer-reviewed they're not they don't have the approval throughout people most of us have been speaking of been saying that that's absolutely true Parsons Brinckerhoff are not some rank outsiders Parsons Brinckerhoff did the original D is for the in the late 90s for the the original proposal they did it over a course of two and a half years of course they didn't try to get it all done in eight months but they just cannot believe that this e is is being used to support such a potentially disastrous in disastrous ly impacting proposal the eight weeks submission periods been referred to it was mentioned that we less time than we gave people to comment on the green bins that's true it is however refreshingly two weeks longer than we give people to comment on a carport so there you go it fits somewhere into that that range of things I mean this is only going to bring all the incoming flights over the mountains going to merge them over Blaxland and what my mother-in-law has done to deserve that I don't know that she's going to cop it and the other 24 7 24 7 airport no curfew and this is the impact that this is going to have is just enormous we're talking about an airport which is not some minor airport this is an airport that's going to be bigger than Dubai eventually 80 million passenger movements per annum and all of that is going to be thrust upon us with this EIS is the only thing underpinning it and we're told well don't worry too much the flight paths for instance or a proof of concept that's fine they may not be the paths that are eventually put in place okay I can accept that I'll tell you when I'll accept it when Greg Hunt Warren truss and Louise Marcus come out and say that they are totally off the table that's when I believe it and I will not believe it before then and even then I would have some so just don't support the airport at all but I don't see why we can't have at least those assurances right now with no argument whatsoever to early 2013 January 2013 and I received a invitation to attend a meeting in Parramatta I was the mayor at the time and I consulted with my deputy who was the esteemed mayor now and I said guess what I've got an invitation to go to Parramatta to the Western Sydney Business Chamber they want to talk to us about an airport and he said go so I did and they said some very interesting things the Western Sydney Business Chamber they said don't worry about this Wilton thing that's happening at the moment and it was the wiltern EIS was out and there was discussion about whether Wilton should be certain he's second Airport as don't worry about that they said this is the business chamber and they had senior bureaucrats from the Department of infrastructure and regional development in the room with them while I said these things so I thought this is a little bit strange these bureaucrats are outwardly gunning for an airport and they wanted a Badgerys Creek and they're saying not to worry about the is that at this very time this is a strange circumstance the same bureaucrats are the ones that you're giving your submissions to at this very minute this process is dodgy this process lacks political scrutiny this process is counselor Christie says is being run by a Canberra machine and this process is not being given the scrutiny by the relevant minister being the deputy prime minister of this country Warren truss who I didn't realize may be on the verge of retirement but whether is or isn't this process is not being looked at by the people that are supposed to the elected officials who are supposed to take care of take care of us so I call on the Deputy Prime Minister to take charge of this situation because it is unacceptable for all the reasons that we have heard and as much has been said it still only basically touches on all of the problems that the CIS has because wherever you look in it where ever you know something about an issue and you look in the u.s. to see how it's been investigated that so the meeting about the EOS happened EAS was released in october and we had an invitation to go to Parramatta to have a briefing on it same building same room and I think I might actually have sat in the same seat as I had a couple of years previously trying to find out what was going on you know you can say that it's rigged and you'd be right um councillor Vander Klai raised the issue having knowledge of bushfire matters and he said well what about if we're doing hazard reductions by fire what about if there's a bushfire how will that affect the impact on the airport we can't find anything in your EOS about that don't worry they said the planes will fly over the smoke and councillor Vander Klai said no no no no what I'm saying is what about if we want to do hazard reduction too because when the most hazard for own place in the world what if we want to do has a reduction at the RFS and they still didn't will fly over the smoke I kid you not I promise you then Chris was there and representatives other councils as well then finally they got it they said I'll look don't worry about it you know Windsor if it rips up I said well the prevailing winds are from the west so it'll push said smoke towards your airport how's this going to work we can't find it in your ears don't worry about other we'll take it on board taken on board tokhon book and in fact I think the the same Minister Deputy Prime Minister has written back and said that those concerns and his view are unfounded I forget the wording he used but he certainly said that it wasn't something we should worry about that's not good enough either briefly this won't talk about tourism I'd posit to you a question you had dying of the death of a thousand cats which one is the fatal one this is the death of a thousand cuts for the Blue Mountains tourism industry in mark I made that anyone in the tourism industry would think that this is a good thing with planes going over currently and think that more is a positive thing for the industry I think they're kidding themselves and one day they'll look up and say you know what all these planes we're not getting the visitation we used to it must be some other reason we'll go and look for some other it'll be all too late all too late it is the death of a thousand cut so that death of a thousand planes or the deaths of death of a thousand whatever you want to talk about but at the end of it all this is the biggest threat to our quality of life in this region's history in this city's history and if we don't stand together and all fight common cause and we are certainly on this council and we are in this community then we're going to get the body black and gold version of an airport the cheapest and nastiest airport that these federal bureaucrats can 20 30 years building for themselves then that's what we're going to get so far up
The principles of landscaping in a bush fire prone area are to reduce the impact of fire directly onto your home minimize the impact of embers attacking your home to give you a defendable space and to create an area where there's less opportunity for direct contact to flame to your home landscapes very important in a bush fire prone area cuz it allows you to have a nice area around your house but also provide an area of safety should have bushfire come and impact on your house there's no such thing as a bush fire proof garden unless you go to the extent of making your garden to sahara desert landscaping is important in a bush fire prone area to give you and your family and your property the greatest protection should a bushfire occur certainly you can have a garden that's bush fire resistant and livable it needs to be designed well it needs to be structured in such a way that there's no ladder fuels and there's no continuance of fire spread across the garden so the type of plants the very important when it comes to planning in a bush fire resistant garden you need to consider using plants that have less oil possibly retain greater water so succulents for example or lilly pilly those types of plants would be useful in a bush fire prone garden some of the plants that should be avoided the things like turpentine trees and some of the gum trees with fibrous bark they're not a particularly good species to have around asset protection zone get plants that are actually consistent with the plan for a well developed and landscape garden a bush fire prone area the landscaping materials you should use in a bush fire resistant garden should effectively be non combustible material so when it comes to mulch use things like pebbles or crushed brick or crash terracotta particularly very close to the proximity of the home when you're building and designing a bush fire resistant garden it's important to look at it holistically things like even the fencing where you've got metal water tanks and static water supplies using rock and crushed pebble and river stones what should really be set out so there's no continuance of fire across from one zone to another we need to have natural breaks we can have lawn in between or rock and pebbles so there's no continuous fire coming from the bushland interface India asset protection zone an asset protection zone is the area immediately around your home that provides protection and greater safety sugar bush fire occur within the asset protection zone there is an inner protection area in an added protection area the inner protection area is designed to be a defendable space so we request that you reduce as much fuels in that area as possible the outer protection area can be landscaped to a point but it's a clear area around your house or a buffer zone that allows some form of protection and a discontinuation of the fuel from where the the bushes and where the house is located asset protection zones are different for each house it looks at things like slope topography how close you are to the bushland interface go onto the RFS website and have a look there your asset protection zone for your property looking after your property in a bush fire prone area is a all year round task but we like to look at it as a preseason cleanup and certainly in early spring it's good to carry out and conduct maintenance around the house trim your garden and make sure that come the onset of the fire season you're in a position to defend the fire property maintenance in a bushfire area is a year-round experience but as we move into the bushfire season it's important to do those things that make your home a defendable space clearing gutters trimming trees mowing lawns removing clipping and it must start at least in early spring because when the fire comes that's often too late for more information go to the Rural Fire Service website or go to Fire and Rescue New South Wales website you
After a fire goes through what happens is you have the ash bed of the fire this is a nutrient rich bed that can be susceptible to weed invasion if you haven't got the weed invasion the native plants will regenerate just from a seed that's been thrown out of capsules and follicles that'll they'll regenerate naturally the australian bush is is designed to cope with fire and actually indeed needs it to maintain its health and genetic diversity this is fleabane that'll come up after the fire so they're wind dispersed they produce a lot of seed the wild tobacco it's in fruit now this is cobblers pegs or farmer's friend and I think a lot of people know this plant it is a big deal that the weeds grow because different weeds like the scotch broom have the capacity to be ecosystem transformers so I've got some scotch broom here it's a noxious weed if you have it on your property you have to eradicate it this is a major weed of the blue mountains and the seed so it needs the fire to actually scarify or crack the seed for it to germinate other plants like the small leaf and large leaf privet they can get up to a size where they crowd out the native plants there's a number of ways that those weeds can then be spread further through the bush either by birds or by water or by wind dispersal those different methods of transportation of the weeds when you're looking at a fertile ash bed in the bush where the canopy covers been taken out and then there's a whole lot of valuable sunlight coming down makes an ideal place for weeds to establish it's the uh the mount morgan waddle uh acacia padala folia you can see this has actually all come up after the fire they're only young now haven't flowered no seed very good time to uh to eradicate it here you've got uh classic edge effects on the side of the road you have some uh some australian natives like this kangaroo grass here you also have introduced species like the african it's important to know which ones are which so if you're if you're looking at spraying weeds then then you wouldn't want to just spray this whole area then if you did that you'd be you'd be killing a lot of the natives when you have large areas affected by weeds it's important to be strategic prioritize areas where you will be most effective target persistent weeds like broom before they get a chance to set seed some short-lived weeds fleabane for example can be useful in the short term to hold soils and wild tobacco can shelter regenerating seedlings plan for several follow-up sessions a single treatment is never effective plan for more activity when weeds are flowering whenever we have bushfires it opens up this the possibility for these weeds to really travel into the bush and impact on it but if you can actually deal with the weeds in your local area and stomp on them after a bush fire then that makes life a lot easier for all involved the best advice you can get is from your local blue mountains they list all the different noxious weeds you can also contact the council and a weed officer will come out and help you identify the problem weeds they'll also work out a bit of a plan of attack
When people have had to rebuild often the last thing that they can think about is the landscape the tafe students have helped the residents by designing their landscapes for them and it's good for our students because they deal with real people in real situations so what they've done is they come out meet with the residents find out what they want the garden used for whether they want an entertaining area or a seating area or children's play area all those sorts of things and then from there they find out what sort of plants they like colors that they like what sort of style of garden they like and they design the garden for them we're here today the team of presenting their landscape designs they came out and and did a quick site inspection a couple of months ago so we're here to grab some ideas going forwards managing the landscaping design in the last part of our rebuild I found that this design brief was interesting because it was an eclectic design brief with a solution that needs to bring native gardens and also your contemporary lifestyle I wanted to maintain large areas of lawn but also include that english cottage style sort of garden beds throughout the site 300 metre square that's good for play or something I suppose I'm little bit excited because I thought I'd have a yard full of cactuses so to see so many different varieties of natives and plants that can attract birds and have color I think that's exciting well I knew nothing about gardening but I wanted a garden that attracted birds I wanted to be and that's what I put to the students and their design was just uh fantastic it really helps people to think about what they want to use their yard for because often people think they if they go and buy a plant they don't necessarily put the plant in the right spot and they don't necessarily get the plant that's best suited for what they want it for so the best thing that they can do is actually plan ahead it helps them to plan for budget as landscape for them so they're not wasting money that they could use otherwise and also means that they can plan it to get low maintenance because if we don't plan sometimes we create maintenance for ourselves it was very important for the garden to be a place that we wanted to spend a lot of time in the house is almost ready and the garden is there is the last bit the most important thing for me to get out of the garden is to have a safe garden for the kids and to protect the house the most important thing for me is having a comfortable setting that's manageable but I've obviously been having been through what we've been through we want to look to the future and make sure that you know prevention is a key for us
Hi my name is Christy and we're rebuilding our garden after the fires the home was completely destroyed Gardens trees backyard pretty much a disaster zone I guess as I called it we do feel that the garden is very important for making the house a home I think when Bronwyn started her garden it was really good to see the transformation from I guess a patch of dirt so yeah it's just a really nice space after the fire the first bit of regrowth was definitely weeds so we often came over just to keep it sort of Tidy at the beginning of the design process we were unsure we didn't know where to look and we wanted it similar to what we had with our old house you can build a bush fire resistant gardener make it look good and you can find many types of different plants and flowers and shrubs that have the color and are perfect for your bushfire attack level rating thinking about losing the house and if we do have plants that retain the water well it's going to we've used and if there was a fire to ever come through again we'd know that the property was prepared and ready I guess to handle it my name is Margaret and in the 2013 bushfires I didn't lose my home but I lost my award-winning garden my gardens all burnt across the front and the whole garden was all burnt everything was blackened statues were blackened I was grateful that I didn't lose my home but quite upsetting to the extent that my husband and I built the garden together and created it so all those holes that he dug were there and now they've all gone my garden consists mostly of European plants because I like the softness and the flower of those although I do have I have put in a few natives yes no I don't put mulch around the house no we'd met or anything that'll catch fire and also keeping bigger trees are away from the house keeping everything fairly clear as possible and keeping everything well prune the house beside me had gone the one I felt that if I could mow their lawn so that when they come back they could at least see something that look nice their place and I said to them that it's time now gardening is therapy to start doing it now and they did they found out that that was quite good therapeutic for them to be able to do that nothing like getting your hands in the soil the garden keeps me active as a healing process for me I enjoy it a great deal hi I'm Karina and I'm cliff we're rebuilding our guard enough the bushfires the gardens being really important like when we first moved in it just looked like a dust bowl and even though you try to make the house the new home you'd always look out and it was dusty and there's nowhere for Sam to play when you turn in the street you'd see your house but then you just look and think of all the work that still had to be done and it still didn't look like a home when way one of the things we wanted to do in the garden was get it to feel like it's us and make it ours there's been so many people to build the house and that's been so much their control that it finally feels like we're up to the stage where we can have some control and we can start at exactly two home yeah making it homely and make it more about who we are I use some of a so I think there's some redbox so that that's that's our next phase we're moving into is looking more into the plants we've definitely looked at you know we don't want to put large trees that are close with canopies to the house itself so we've sort of started planting plants that are more green and a lower in height the crosswords closer to the to the edges of the house and we're we're sort of looking into different plants and trees for further down the yard away from the house so the planning of the has helped us to make it feel like a tome here
Come on Barry one of these well I've written a petitioner kids petition against the Badgerys Creek Airport because well it's just going to effectively mountains in a lot of ways and the kids are going to be the ones who are going to be living with the effects and no they haven't done any research on how it's going to affect us health wise and environmentally and it's just not a good idea Western see the airport is going to bring terrible lives to all the residents here we'll have pollution water pollution air pollution noise pollution 24 hours a day seven days a week chicken thank you starter work together to protect the way of life for this community a community that acceptable outcome can be achieved in finalizing the western sydney airport flight paths to attend tonight's meeting I made a long-standing commitment at a local schools of water by a grave concerns the impacts on welfare inclusive national party that distress identity it's the last one is a strategic plan respective aircraft but this needs to be reviewed world heritage as the epic cover the spread of the past now heaven those planes go overhead that just trashes everything it was the last wild river the gross value for us we thought it had protection for national parks you thought it had protection from the World Heritage Area but it seems that this proposal goes ahead it's just trashed the last bit of our country now where the people that showed governor phillip where the damn water was yeah what a mistake that was and this is is most extraordinarily botched and disappointing and utterly unsatisfactory research shows a direct link between noise pollution and its negative impact on learning it can cause children to read more slowly reduces their performance in tests like the HSC causes developmental delays and it interferes with children's motivation memory language attentiveness concentration and speech in particular aircraft noise also causes children to have elevated blood pressure increased stress hormones strokes and heart disease children are more at risk from air pollutants and breathing double the amount of air from adults we already have high asthmatic rates and toxic aircraft're really getting a significant amount of noise for those 10 seconds that error plane passes overhead and that has not been considered in any way mitigated by the e is the case against the second airport in western Sydney is about much more than noisy flight path and protecting the environment it is about what sort of a society want Australia to be what is our vision for the future are we to be a modern forward-looking society taking advantage of innovative new technology and new transport systems such as high-speed rail to reduce our carbon footprint or are we to continue to rely on last century fossil fuel driven technology and transport which will leave us lagging behind the rest of the world that is the question that this campaign asks and that is the question that will take the blue mountains from an iconic Australian attraction on the tourist map and put a center stage on the political map as we take this issue to the Australian people will the lucky country become the stupid country that misses the boat when it comes to the new employment world charges ahead with innovative schemes to replace fossil fuel and transport networks with alternative sources of energy production and transportation will we be known as the country that trash is a World Heritage Area by building an airport and an unnecessary airport that on its doorstep the campaign to protect the environment and preserve the quality of life in the Blue Mountains artists a very big question it asked where is Australia heading when it comes to creating a dynamic and productive low-carbon economy and a healthy environment for us all to live but this Airport is dumping on the Blue Mountains he's dumping on the people of Western Sydney and must not go ahead the points just be made it can be a key issue in this election campaign it's robbie money from infrastructure that is badly needed we do not need this project under any circumstances have as a community I believe that our actions over the last two months and our response to the EIS show that no government can take us for granted those of you who are here tonight you've been done and if this government thinks that the deadline for the ER e is marks the end of our opposition they don't know us they don't know the blue mountains thank you the upper Blue Mountains flight path is horrific it will impact the upper mountains it doesn't kick in to look folks are going to address the whole issue of the content of which this community has been held by the federal government and their boffins 15 years ago that's all 15 years ago it was knocked on the head the Herod Gavin for a host of reasons so it was no good on that 15 in that 15 years the boffins and the government's have sat on their hands they thought of no creative solutions about Sydney's western cities transport problems no future which stick leaves or park high speed rail they sat in their hands and waited for the propitious political moment to come along and now all of a sudden they're saying oh we're going to actually we need to consult you we're going to consult you hear you now well I'm going to consult you right now I'm going to ask you and I want your answer loud and clear do you accept this Airport as it is presently configured began to be boarded Badgerys Creek can you be be clear I think we all agree that the proposed Western Sydney Airport is an inappropriate enormously costly mistake that is highly unlikely to succeed make councils obligate objections count by highlighting all compelling arguments I urge all councillors here to read this information presented and amend council submissions accordingly they compose the Western Sydney Airport Thank You support high speed rail initiatives you know it makes sense I love our Blue Mountains community and it is under siege as a community we have a moral obligation to protect and preserve our societal values environment health and amenity actually that's the role of government but they have a history of making pretty bad decisions and this one's an absolute whopper don't forget the community with the people to stop the Franklin from being downed it was community to stop the destruction of that stopped the Badgers Creek Airport in 1998 the Southwest Sydney basin has got to be the dumbest place in the world for an airport I found that the consensus is that a Boeing 737 at 1850 not 1318 50 meters produces 90 decibels of sound not 60 but 90 not much of a difference only fifty percent difference no because of the log scale that difference will be eight times louder than they're claiming it will be rather than conversational level it will be as loud as a motorcycle at seven and a half meters or a lawnmower believe me when a plane comes over you won't hear your neighbor mowing their lawn and what is the government trying to hide our governments EIS is dishonest to respect a noise in so many ways I'll go in the details mountains right here the actual probable noise levels are going to would be a hundred times larger than what they are reporting in the EIS as you all know the australian government released that draft EIS in mid-october and as you all know that draft EIS is the environment the problem is it doesn't it simply doesn't do what it was meant to do instead as Bob Davis said tonight it reads as a catalogue of errors is this just another captain's call that should go the way of knights and dames I wonder this is sloppy and it shows frankly a complete disregard for you and for the rest of the people in western Sydney why should one Sydney Airport bear the burden of a curfew and not another tourism surprisingly one operator thinks that I'm a socialist and they're right is one of our largest industries and it is the economic powerhouse of this region is the lifeblood of our small businesses to the draft EIS is grossly inadequate considering that the Western Sydney Airport is the most significant proposal affecting the livability of Western Sydney for the next century we say this the minister for the environment should reject the draft EIS and as a result this Airport should not be approved look the emotion in the room tonight was far beyond what I expected the the feeling was is concerned about the World Heritage Area the public speakers were magnificent I've I'm so proud of this community but far beyond what I expected big message to government that they're going to have a fight on their hand they would a huge fight on their hands one of the things about the people of the Blue Mountains is that we're very good at fighting we're very good at coming together you know concentrating those flights over us was picking the wrong town to have a blue with you can't fight city hall you can't fight this city hall we're not going to take it yes and the standard of the a is as far as you're concerned it's not up to it it's sloppy it's simply a sloppy document that mrs. all of the key points you would expect an EIS to cover for an airport not acceptable not respectful of the community of the blue mountains in western Sydney it just you could not base a decision on that document just going to have to lump the bottom line unfortunately this battle won't be fought and won on the basis of logic it'll be fought and won on the basis of politics and the some marginal see dem please out here they're going to start getting very very nervous for the time we're finished with them
These are the words of trish doyle mp the federal government's new airport will have a huge impact on our lives the revelations so far are that there will be no curfew there will be a concentration of flight path merge points above the lower blue mountains and there will be no rail infrastructure links to alleviate the road congestion exacerbated by the new airport the prime minister malcolm turnbull must do a better job than he has so far in explaining to our community what the impacts of his airport will be on our area one information session is not enough moreover mr turnbull must take on board the concerns and criticisms raised through the public consultation process and he must act on them we need to have those who are making these plans and decisions turn up and answer questions at a range of public meetings our community must mobilize to ask these questions and demand straight answers over the past two years I've explained that an airport only had my conditional support if the abbott turnbull government would release a new and independent environmental impact and noise impacts guarantee rail infrastructure and permanent employment opportunities for people in the blue mountains in western sydney and provide protection for our world heritage listed national park area and surrounds preferably with a tick of approval from unesco on the question of 24 7 flight paths in my opinion I don't think there should be one rule for the city and one rule for the west if mascot is to retain its curfew then the turnbull government's new airport should also have a curfew the eis analysis says very little of any substance about the potential impact on the greater blue mountains world heritage area of aircraft overflight above our national parks substantial sections of the world heritage area and sydney's drinking water catchment uh will will be beneath the new flight paths so the eis must address uh what needs to be done to protect these areas instead of pretending that because the proposed bypass are indicative only it can it can't thoroughly analyze those impacts we should not have to wait until the airport is up and running to start looking at addressed now I would encourage concerned members of our community to contact our federal mp louise marcus and make her aware of your views we must let mrs marcus know what we think of the plan to build an airport on our doorstep as a proud as as a proud member for blue mountain sorry as a proud member of the blue mountains conservation society I would encourage people to you to also make use of the information provided on their website and facebook page and get involved in this campaign our next step is important work together as a community in the fight for changes to some of these ludicrous proposals let the voices of the blue mountains be heard so says the member for blue mountain stretch doyle thank you now I um have normally I accept six speakers on an item three four and three against um tonight I have 11 4 the council's proposition and three against it is my intention to admit all speakers tonight so that everybody gets to have a say and I think that is really important so if everyone will think it's important before I take speakers just to very quickly go through the resolution that you're all speaking to and that is before the council tonight because I know a lot of you for a lot of you this has come quickly and you may not have had a chance to properly digest it so if I can take a moment I'll walk you through the resolution that is before the council tonight the first part of the resolution is that council notes its previous position and resolutions on the proposal for a second airport at badgery's creek that the council asserts its opposition to the significant impacts identified in the draft eis arising from the proposed western sydney airport flight paths on the blue mountains local government area and greater blue mountains world heritage area that the council notes that the draft eis identifies that the western sydney airport flight paths will have detrimental impact on the blue mountains communities aspirations for a livable city with a high quality natural environment in particular extensive flight path activity over concentrated over the lower mountains over mountains world heritage area inadequate consideration and measures to address the negative impact on tourism recreational and ecological values of the lower blue mountains significant increase in noise impact estimated at 55 decibels across towns and villages as well as natural areas and continuous and increasing levels of aircraft uh movement through a 24-hour cycle including at night over the lower blue mountains resulting in approximately 200 flights a day by 2030 that the council writes to the commonwealth government to express its concerns with the inadequate time frame for public exhibition and community engagement and seeks an extension to the public exhibition period to allow a minimum of 90 days for formal consultation that the council endorses the preparation of a submission to the draft eis and that this submission be reported to the council at the ordinary meeting of 8 december 2015 that the council delegates the authority to the mayor and general manager that's dangerous to undertake appropriate action in support of council's position on the impacts identified the draft eis including authorizing the expenditure of up to fifty thousand dollars uh the authority to call a public meeting that the the council are kept regularly updated on issues as they arise during the public exhibition period and are consulted on the proposed actions during the preparation of council submission and actions proposed as part of any public initiatives that the council rights to seek an urgent meeting of the mayor deputy mayor with the honourable warren trust mp deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructural regional development and separately with the honourable greg hunt mp minister for the environment to discuss the location concentration and significant disproportional impact of the proposed flight paths in the city of blue mountains that the council rights to seek an urgent meeting with a federal member for macquarie mrs louise marcus mp to reiterate council's concerns regarding the impacts on the blue mountains of the airport proposal and to seek her views and support that the council extends invitations to participate in any subsequent meetings on this matter to representatives of our strategic alliance partner penrith city council as well as the adjoining federal member of parliament fiona scott mp member for lewin member for lindsay given both the blue mountains and penrith and that the council rights to the commonwealth department of infrastructure and regional development to express its concerns with the inadequate time frame for public exhibition and community engagement and requests that a letterbox drop with information about the proposed airport and draft is be completed to all blue mountains residents and that are further commute and that further further community information session be held in november that's what's before us um I will now turn to um public speakers um I have 11 in favor and three against I think we're all very fortunate that this council has sought specialist advice on such an elaborate eis it's really quite difficult to find out precisely what it's telling us and I make no claims to understand the detail but I have got a couple of real concerns one is that the eis is considering stage one only the single runway and we're promised that around about 2030 I believe there'll be a second runway we don't know anything about that and presumably if the first runway objecting to the second one I think that's a a fairly big issue and of course I'm also concerned about the relentlessness of the no curfew which is already in your motion but the specific uh fear that has led me to come and speak tonight is that as we're seeking to find a relief from the proposed flight paths if the council's first position can't_''_566.32 be achieved I fear an abominable choice may be offered do we relieve the decibels over the residential urban areas sorry move extension of time by a further two minutes move councillor fell second council I've been at all those in favor against carrick jones really sorry everybody no that's anyhow the abominable choice between the urban living areas or the protected native areas that are surrounding us the natural areas so it's almost like would you prefer to destroy the quality of life of your father or of your mother that's the sort of issue that I'm particularly concerned about so in this discussion I hope we can remember the amazing values of ago this month the greater blue mountains the all the 10 000 square kilometers were inscribed on the world heritage list and there's a question why and it's because of the story they tell us of australia's evolving eucalypt vegetation and sheltering habitats of a country with breathtaking views table ants cliff faces valleys waterfalls swamps teeming with life and great tracts of wilderness for the human experience of solitude as much as anything else and of course with our much loved string of towns threaded through so this the antiquity and that fragile diversity of forms of life and the beauty are what are at risk here they're vital to our cultural and economic life and this is a place which has great strength but also enormous vulnerability in 2000 australia promised the world to protect the outstanding quality of this area forever that's what the world heritage convention says and so that was a formal commitment a formal international commitment to share the custodianship of the place with those who already cherish it like this council national parks rangers firefighters climbers everywhere indigenous be useful that the council remind the federal government that it is obliged to ensure that no environment home comes here thank you my name is jeff mile I'm a resident in lithgow and I'm here as an interested citizen I oppose recommendations two three and five I put to the blue mountain city council that time and resources expended on engaging with opposing the development proposal for the western sydney airport could be better spent elsewhere evidence I see suggests that the western sydney airport if it proceeds will probably be redundant before it even becomes operational that therefore council members will not need to be concerned about any environmental impacts within the blue mountains city council lga related to the proposed development as it is probable there will be no aircraft landing or taking off from this proposed airport the bad news for stakeholders includes potentially several billion dollars of capital investment squandered on a white elephant that could be better utilized and spent elsewhere and the consequences of a post oil world that our society is apparently ill-prepared for in 2009 dr fatiha birol as said quote one day we will run out of oil it is not today or tomorrow but one day we will run out of oil and we have to leave oil before oil leaves us and we have to prepare ourselves for that day end quote to me this is sound advice but it seems that many of our political and business leaders continue to willfully ignore it in december 2013 the world's oldest ongoing peer-reviewed scientific journal issued a special theme publication concerning the future of oil supply where the authors of the introduction paper stated quote we conclude that a sustained decline in global conventional production appears probable before 2030 and there is a significant risk of this beginning before 2020. the inclusion of title oil resources appears unlikely to significantly affect this conclusion end quote other energy analysts are also warning of impending and inevitable structural changes to our energy supply systems beginning in a time frame of the order of years perhaps months but not decades away yet many politicians and business leaders behave as if our fossil fuel supplies will remain affordable and abundant to the australian senate inquiry into australia's transport energy resilience and sustainability and my april 9 public hearing testimony recorded in hansard on the australian parliament website to gain an overview of the looming energy security challenges my presentation slides and script to the new south wales planning assessment commission public hearing concerning the early mine extension project review can be found at the pac website christopher webber at katembo explained succinctly on page 18 in the october 21st edition of the blue mountains gazette why the proposed airport is likely to become a quite a white elephant sooner than you think end quote instead of expanding time and resources on engaging with opposing the proposal for the western sydney airport at badgers creek in my informed opinion blue mountain city council should be considering how it will continue to perform and function in a post-peak oil ratio thank you yes my name is donna mulhern I'm from woodford and I support the recommendations an urgent addition regarding current excessive air point noise in the blue mountains that the excessive noise that we currently experience be investigated and that we are now experiencing I moved to woodford two years ago from the city to get away from noise I moved with plans on my nine acre beautiful bush property which was a significant investment to do meditation we built a labyrinth we invite people who are traumatized to come for healing in the peace and quiet of the blue mountains you can imagine how we feel let me give you an indication about what this the western sydney airport how it's going to impact because I've got a little bit of experience to share I can shed light on those noise levels which currently are just figures in the morning I'm woken up at 6 20 a.m every morning through my double glazed winds with thick curtains drawn from a deep sleep I'm woken up at night I'm a sensible girl I go to bed around 10 30. I'm woken up then at around 11 30 by the last planes going through again and all day every 10 minutes they go on and on and on I tested today on that little talking about ten thousand feet five thousand feet that must be what's going on here at woodford because it's so so very loud I'm going to check what it is so I went on it's a very funky little thing you look at the map and the airplane comes across you click on it and it tells you listen to what wakes me up at 6 20 and 11 20 pm 17 250 feet wakes me up from a deep sleep folks we are in trouble and we are in deep trouble I heard nineteen thousand and twenty thousand as well this is not they call it traffic noise this is not traffic noise this is noise pollution we moved here to get away from traffic noise some of us suffer from the highway traffic noise we don't want more traffic noise and those of us who don't have it don't want it and that's why we moved here eco-tourism is the future of the blue mountains eco-tourism will suffer the most western sydney airport will not bring tourism to the blue anecdotal evidence I'm a bit of a cheeky girl I approach tourists who are having their cafe and have to raise their voice when the noise when the planes come over it went were false I said what do you think about this they said well we decided last night we're not coming back here we'll try the central coast or the southern highlands I heard one person booked out of their bnb a day earlier they said we're going home to get some peace and quiet I grew up at west pinball underneath the north shore flight path we had converging flight paths at 5000 feet noise there was sufficient that when the plane started to come over at 10 to 6 in the morning when the curfew stopped you couldn't hear the radio the alarm went off you heard plane not talk we moved to some peters at the time when they were looking at building a third runway we did extensive uh study of the eis and we thought we were quite informed and made a decision based on that that we on the periphery of the flight path this is the government official document ended up with planes overhead about one day and three landing so no confidence in the veracity of the is's um now as far as the airport itself goes I suspect that's well and truly done deal the ship has sailed as far as that not going ahead flight paths there are three considerations that we take into account safe ops minimising the affected number of residents and maximizing the movements guess where the minimum number of resins are I don't have much luck in having a big impact on the actual flight path plans curfew hopefully we can do something uh curfew and night noise I worked at the gore bay shipping terminal for shell for many years that's a site that was responsible for bringing in 40 of the state's fuel so you know it's not a small thing when the ship engine noise exceeded 50 decibels we were forced to shut down this is for a few hundred residents around the lower north shore on the harbour I the ambient background noise is about 43 decibels so 50 decibels was a grand total of seven above the night time background noise I'll leave your draw your own conclusions on what will happen here uh the documentation that's been supplied to us by the government contains a wonderful selection of words might may projected predicted planned potential my name is tony adamski and I live where that green dot is and where the convergence of all the arrivals to come to the airport there I live there so I'm only the flights are only 20 k's away from me and they're all coming into blackstone right there so that's where I live and that's where I'm coming from what I'd like to do is to absolutely congratulate the blue mountain city council the mayor the general manager officers and staff and all the councillors for this excellent um uh addendum that that's that's included a few other additional points of meeting with the the deputy prime minister and louise marcus and fiona scott for council to come in tremendous because without without the support without the support of yourself mr mayor the general manager and the officers uh we here as the community would find it rather heavy going to try and combat what's what's proposed down at badgery's creek so thank you very much thank you all the councillors thanks for the great effort that's been put into this into this document here I absolutely love the um the consultation that that that is proposed in terms of meeting with mr truss he needs to be met with pretty quickly and um and and and and some of the other people that need to be talked to I would encourage also that the the prime minister somehow get into the into the scheme of things because he needs to be uh to told what's uh what's happening around here and I would encourage everyone that's here to write not only to to the local member for macquarie but also right to the prime minister and just let him know what's going on and what our feelings are and just the lower mountains now there was a speaker there earlier on the speaker at woodford I think she came from woodford and there's the flight tracker now there's a there is a flight going from from kingston smith flying over glenbrook at 5 10 pm on the 30th of october flying at 11 600 feet now all of this stuff that's in the eis and there's 50 000 pages or whatever it is it's very difficult to um to negotiate but there are diagrams in there that that all comes from the eis and I do encourage everyone to to make a submission to the eis write to louise marcus write to the prime minister write to everybody and and become engaged with uh with the council in terms of how they're moving forward with the uh public forum community engagement because this can this can be stopped thank you tony and thank you very much as can you thank you very much thank you tony well done susan templeman hazelbrook but my heart's in windmilly I'm speaking in support of the that bushfire poses to our community but I see the plans for arriving aircraft at western sydney airport as the biggest single threat to what makes this place unique the eis puts a bullseye directly above blackstone glenbrook and waramu sending planes through our skies 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year something that no other part of sydney is subjected to there's no curfew no noise sharing these flight paths are simply unacceptable I spoke to many people prior to the eis being released some accepted that some planes would fly overhead others didn't but no one anticipated that 100 of arrivals would fly at the volume and the height you've heard the figures for blackstone but people haven't yet looked at other suburbs like windmilly where twenty to thirty flights a day at six to seven thousand feet and fifteen to thirty in the evenings and overnight to start with increasing over time to 145 over 25 period by 2050 to city dwellers who always knew that ksa was in their basin it may seem like not a big mountains are the same reason we chose to live here peace and quiet that will go we don't live here because we like bushfires and we certainly don't live here because we like getting up at 5am to commute to the city for a day's work but we deal with those things because we absolutely love this place and the idea that we will never be able to sit on a summer evening on our verandas not accompanied by aircraft noise rumbling from above absolutely devastates me the abs data recently showed that once people move to the mountains we don't leave you actually have to carry us out in a box uh so you can expect our community to to fight to preserve as much as we can I'm angered by what's in the ees by the lack of time this community has been given to digest it it shows a total lack of respect by the federal government for us and we're being given just one three hour opportunity to attend an information session was an absolute disgrace at the very those who live in the north shore in the east to have a curfew and noise sharing at the very least that's good enough for us for yeah if that makes sense um this is one of those issues that I get really emotional about any attack on our way of life now this needs to be above party politics whether you love the idea of an airport on your doorstep whether you accept it as something that's inevitable whether you loathe the idea of planes flying relentlessly through our skies this is the time to come together and fight against this eis the council can lead by example on that score by voting unanimously in favor of this motion my name is bob treasure I've lived at warren since 1973. in that time in the name of progress I've seen many developments some good some not so good some bad but this is the greatest abomination I've ever come across in my whole time in the mountains I'm here to say that you people are going to be charged with being limbies not for trying to protect your way of life but I'm here to say I am a niabe not in anybody's backyard I'm here to say that we can oppose this airport and we can win we are in exactly the same position as they were in 1998 when the eis was distributed and circulated people responded to that there were 15 950 responses to that submission 99 of them were against can we emulate that can we spread this whole word not only to the mountains but to the people of western sydney as well can we do that we can stop this airport and I'll tell you why we can stop it because it's not even necessary it is unnecessary it's one of the great con jobs of the last decade it was thought up by a failed prime minister who needed to say something about infrastructure it is a con job let me illustrate why most of you know that sydney mascot already even with the curfew only operates at 60 capacity that's the truth you may not know or you in 1999 it's only increased its usage by three percent why because more people are packed into bigger planes that process is going to go on into the future as well you may not know that the management of sydney airport has been quoted as saying and I will quote that they can handle the doubling of passengers to 74.3 million by 2033. that's not me that's saying that it's sydney airport corporation trust me they don't want this airport really they've been dragged to the table on it and they know why it's not going to be profitable the only way it can be profitable is if it has a that it's the only way we need to remember that could I just say this oh my god do I just say this the main argument in the the need for western sydney airport has been international tourism I want you to see this this bar graph of passenger movements in the last year at mascot do you think this is dubai or singapore or anything like that does anybody make one on the left eight million movements is to melbourne the next one is the brisbane then the next one is gold coast adelaide perth it's only when we get to auckland that we get to a foreign climb the other ones the ones that I mentioned are down here dubai singapore etc 60 of the passenger movements moving out of mascot are domestic ladies and gentlemen domestic ones not international ones this whole thing about the pressure of international tourism is a lot of codswallop and we are going to be batteries creek is going to be predominantly a domestic airport and I'm here to say I'm here to say uh please could you give me an extension just a few minutes as afraid as afraid as I am to say it bob I think your passion speaks a million words and that was a corker thank you very much jay fernando and I'm definitely for the the um what's been proposed and how can I follow that your act now really three three minutes is not enough to say how I feel violated in this room also feels violated about what has occurred what's been put upon us only one week ago has not given us enough time to really get out there publicly nationally to say what an absolute disgrace this is upon the people of the blue mountains I'm not of any political affiliation I'm a resident of blackstone and as I said we feel violated everyone in the mountains feels violated we're coming together as a community not for a political party not for any other sort of affiliation group we are here to fight as a community when we come together to help the fieries whenever it's a bushfire what what gets us through what gets us all through it's the spirit of the blue mountains and we need to call upon everyone within the blue mountains to come ahead and fight together for this I am absolutely disgusted at the proposal and the detrimental effect this is going to have on the community but on all level levels the repercussions are for you know not just environmental but for tourism for ecological been happened to us and excuse me for for saying this word but I feel like it's been a rape of the people of the blue mountains it's taken away choices from us it's been inflicted upon us without our knowledge without our consultation and that's what violation is violation is a form of rape and that's what's happened here we have been the sacrificial lambs out west for far too long we need to get together and fight I have I have emailed um world heritage organization and I got a reply from the director and I said about the urgency for them to get involved with this as well I have also emailed many other conservation groups wildlife organizations national parks and wildlife and what they told me is that everyone needs to get onto their facebook pages to send them an email as well because it's the voice of the people the voice of the blue mountains that is going to get us through this no other public out there will not those affected people don't want it in here tonight use any form of media social media talk to friends about it and get people to use these websites I've also given mark a list of all the different type of conservation groups wildlife groups national park groups maybe mark that you can also post that group on the forum so those people are thinking who do I contact you've got a reference point to go and look at so please please and I know you're all here to fight together we can do this we did it for the bushfires every year when we have catastrophes we can do it for this as well thank you shea and I live on the same street uh we live in blackstone and um you know we overlook the national park it's beautiful it's spiritual it's revitalizing and it's surreal and I feel I live in the most beautiful spot in the world last week out of the blue it was brought to our attention what the proposed flight paths would be I was totally and utterly dismayed at the proposal I went saturday and I was in total shock at what was proposed in fact I had to be nearly carried out I was crying I was in tears I was absolutely in shock I phoned my husband and I told him get here now and see what they're proposing I was also disgusted that only one session in the blue mountains is scheduled and I can tell you shea and I have been walking around glen brook have been walking around our community and nobody knows about it no one and I think that is shocking there has been absolutely no inference in the last 20 years from the government federal and state that flight paths would come across the lower blue mountains my husband and I are professionals and we work extremely long hours and we travel two to four hours a day we don't mind making these sacrifices monday to friday because when we come home we have a beautiful home and an environment to come back to each day and know that we are revitalized by our surroundings at the weekend for the long week ahead the proposed plans were released we never saw this coming it's been an appalling shock I have been in tears every day since the proposed plans have been announced because I love the blue mountains I love it I love the blue mountains in all my years of life I have never witnessed such a violation upon a beautiful community such as ours what can we do to change this what can we do to stop it governments should not be allowed to violate and destroy a community in such a shocking deceitful manner I am absolutely distraught and so are many others in my community please please conserve the blue mountains please help thank you my name's floyd I'm a resident floyd chambers I'm a resident of falcon bridge I've heard a lot of emotion in the room tonight on on against the airport um when I first came here tonight I was asked to tick the box for and against so my position here tonight is to as as from my personal experience I was a pilot myself I worked near traffic control instrument approach procedure design I'm coming out here to speak on on one issue and that is the the wedge pattern that's actually been originated to that uh north west sector that could be positioned in another spot basically I think the airport's inevitable I think it will happen but it's a way we've got to work around it okay there's a more feasible area down to the south west and south of sydney um around the thermometer and picton area okay there are a couple issues there the 24 hours is another concern of mine you've got the environmental issues that's coming out of the mountains and I think the areas down to the south are not as going to be less impactive okay there's also the safety issue the less population down down towards that direction currently the modelling right now is 100 movements in that northwest sector okay basically what that means is that orientation of runway zero five two three it doesn't matter we're gonna get we're gonna cop the whole lot in that on the direction of the wind okay there are people are places in the world where there are numerous airports in close proximity to one another um for example in europe london catholic london heath rogers stands dead heathrow stat stands dead I believe that the current proposal should be reinvestigated further because either way we're going to have to live around work with it and live with it there are several options that that can be done from a procedural design point of view and they should be investigated by the powers above local government and not local government and state on a federal level thank you that's a pleasure uh there's a question for you from councillor vander clay floyd yes council thank you for um your comment was that the area around blackstone where I forgot what the word is the merger point is that it can be moved out my question to you is as an expert who's been flying planes can it be put over the over the sea on either the south or the other side of mascot and the gosford around that area out to sea yeah the issue you have with those patterns that you just suggested is sydney airport okay sydney will still be usable and it's the entry and exit points to that airport where you'll have confliction currently the currently what we have in the setup in in the proposal right now the departure routes are not the not the worst routes uh the departure routes is where you have maximum uh engine noise coming off that of that aircraft and the arrival routes are more required quite a segment coming in not not to say that they're not noisy but they are of of concern the the more proper area to put those entry points would be down in that south just south of camden you picked in the oaks as an entry point to come into that to the northerly runway and then an actual fly around pattern back to the to the south to the north to the southerly runway thank you areas like black town uh areas like panel will still be get affected thank you but on that enough yep floyd thank you for your time um I won't go over much of the information that's already been put forward by previous speakers particularly susan templeman um I i could have had the same speech I have a fairly simple point to make about this draft eis and just think of the words ladies and gentlemen this is a draft environmental impact statement and the flight paths proposed in this eis do not consider aircraft noise and called me old-fashioned but I would have thought that aircraft noise is an environmental impact so therefore how can we have in front of us a sufficient environmental impact statement to be taken forward for proper consideration I can bore you and lead you through page 25 of section 2 where it says it is important to note that the conceptual design did not consider potential noise abatement opportunities which will form an essential part of the formal airspace design process consultation with airlines and other stakeholders would be undertaken what is words this document this this is this is the draft airspace architecture and operation there is written by a bunch of propeller heads it has the regulatory context potential airspace parameters airspace control areas restricted areas defensive space operations danger areas and then it gets to preliminary assessment of airspace it says an important aspect to note that relevant to this draft eis is that a proof of concept design does not take into account other influences on air traffic movement such as consideration of noise impacts call me old-fashioned but I say the document is insufficient and I would request that the council make a strong representation such that this does not move beyond draft until a full assessment of those noise impacts has been made those that assessment has been made including noise abatement it is a fundamental failure in this document in my opinion thank you not my intention tonight to speak about my personal views for against the airport my focus is on addressing our concerns as volunteer firefighters in the lower mountains of the impact of the proposed flight paths in the exclusion zone that covers the lower blue mountains which is part of the most bushfire prone place on the there be any effect or restrictions on air support for firefighting operations on air support for hazard reductions um on our training that's critical to um people being able to do their jobs in establishing air bases how we do can we establish air bases under those flight paths and uh in those exclusion zones the flight paths in the lower blue mountains they'll be as low as 5 000 feet when you talk about the distance between the actual ground and it's actually 4 000 feet because the 5 5000 feet is at sea level with those flight paths being that low um are firefighting aircraft going to be able to work unrestricted below that height of 5000 feet and again we're talking about fires hazard reduction all of those kinds of things and in relation to hazard reductions without aircraft support will the smoke the particles both visible and not visible to the eye would they affect the aircraft will we be able to conduct hazard reduction programs under those flight paths and in those exclusion zones we already have a very narrow window able to continue to do that with additional imposition we're just not going to be able to get it done as effectively as we need to for the community thank you very much for your time during during fire incidents uh I believe the uh the instant controller is airborne in helicopter so that he can have vision over the whole of the fire ground is that right uh that's certainly true in some circumstances where time allows and depending upon the circumstances certainly the incident controller does do that it is not uncommon for divisional commanders the field based commanders are responsible to be up in the aircraft in some cases almost on a daily basis we sometimes deal with an enormous amount of aircraft I think available to the rfs across new south wales we have something in the vicinity of 300 aircraft and when you're talking about multiple aircraft you're not just talking about the ones that are dropping the water you're also talking about those aircraft that are up there doing the coordination as well and by virtue of that they aircraft that doing the water bombing and fire suppressing and and and greg how how how many days a year would you estimate that we usually get for hazard reductions oh that might as further than that and how often are they cancelled because of uh air pollution or an issue like that oh both very good questions to which I can't give you a a very good answer it really does vary from year to year um there have certainly been hazard reductions that have had to be put off because of air quality issues there's certainly no doubt about that and the department of health takes those things quite seriously of course but you know with the weather that we've had this year for example um we've had I would think no more than um four or five days where we've been able to do hazard reduction as part of the rfs program and obviously uh the national parks have been able to achieve some mud this year too but certainly it's been a lean year thank you thanks mr corrigan I been going through hell for such a long time with flights going overhead so I can imagine what it's going to be like when they bring this in or if they do but we can stop it I rang the pollution people at mascot and asked them why waramu was suddenly a flight path and they said because another area in the mountains had got together sensibly and got a whole lot of people signatures and they were able to stop change the flight path so we can I don't know how true that is but that's what I was told and um I won't mention the place that it was but I just think they're very sensible people the um the thing that got me most was I had to ring the fire brigade I saw this enormous ball going down across from my house and I thought my god are planes going down it wasn't a plane it was pollution and I got the fire brigade in the end they told me what it was I rang the police and the fire know if this is an effect or not there was a bushfire in that very area between two schools blackstone public and waramu public so I have no idea whether that was a cause of it or not but you know that was very dangerous because there were so many children that were involved that couldn't get out because they couldn't get the buses in to get them out we had one night I came home from I just nearly cried because in the air there were five planes and I know they were practicing for this airport there were five some going east some going west and they're flying right over our house so I beg everybody to get together and fight this we can do it we can stop it since the day I was elected in 1999 I have opposed any airport at badgers creek as president of wes rock I led that fight along with a lot of other people in the community uh trish and kieran mcnain are here in the audience they were in the sun herald with me the day they're feeling the same sense of deja vu that I am hearing now wes rock's changed its position on this but we have not and and while it is the case that some of us in the room like me might be opponents of an airport others of us in the room would countenance an airport but what unites us is this proposal what's before us now is this proposal and what needs to be fought is this proposal because what was before us 15 years ago was not as bad nowhere near as bad as this proposal because what we have right now is quite frankly simply summed up with one word it's unfair it's unfair because all of the convergence points are right here in the blue mountains above blackstone waramu down to the bottom it's unfair because there is no noise sharing it's unfair because it's 24 7. it's unfair because no one else cops this level of noise just us it's unfair because it happens 365 days a year at 5 000 feet in some points at all when you look at that and compare it to how the inner city is being treated it is no doubt that we are being treated as second-class citizens when john kaniha spoke before about his experience at saint peter's or at least there was some respite there's none for us none for us at all and this council with you will fight this proposal we will fight it because who wasn't shocked when it was released just a week ago whose breath wasn't taken away as a long-term activist against any airport I couldn't believe what was proposed never in my wildest dreams did I think it would impact the blue mountains this much and we will not let this go and we will not leave you unattended because whatever threatens the blue mountains as was said before by shea I think it was be it bushfires be it developers be it aeroplanes this council will not leave this city unattended whether it is getting the state government to do the right thing after 2013 whether it's asking them to accept our political flavor that this proposal is unacceptable this council will not leave you unattended there's a simple philosophy here it's not very ideological and it's this if it's bad for the blue mountains this mob will oppose it with vigor until we get a result when I mean this mob I don't mean us around the circular chair here I mean you too because we are nothing without you as I say when I was wesrock president 15 years ago I was extremely young we were told we'd never stop it we were told we had no chance at all and we stopped it didn't we bob and bob would agree with me when I say that we can stop it now we need to be as belligerent now as we were then and we need and we need we need to stick together that's when we're best whether it's fires or leps that's when we're best when we stick together that's what the blue mountains does really well we need to stick together as we do life in this room tonight fieries people who do all sorts of jobs sitting in this room tonight we all vote different ways with different religious views or none we're all different but there's one really unique thing about us when the blue mountains is threatened haven't you noticed how we stick together and we need to do it now I'm not going to kid you and say this isn't going to be a very big fight and I can't promise you victory but I can promise you this if we don't try it will happen thank you many people reside in the mountains as is relatively quiet and peaceful aircraft noise from planes approaching this proposed airport will have a detrimental and a severe effect on this peace and quiet this airport will not have a curfew which means planes will land 24 hours a day seven days a week and take off as well also if a plane that is intended to land at sydney's mascot airport cannot make the curve for you there guess where it's going to flying over the mountains at the moment like you do hear them they are noisy especially in the six o'clock in the morning sometimes wakes you up um however if planes are flying into badgery's creek or western sydney airport they're going to be flying a lot lower altitude because badgers creek is a lot closer the mascot and there'll be a lot more of them a lot more of them and they'll only be about 1.3 kilometres high I can't working feet totally out of that imperial measurements okay there has been an argument that planes getting quieter these days that may be the case that might I'm not I'm not an expert on aircraft noise or so I can't really qualify that'll comment on that okay older planes have been older planes such as 707 727s dc-10s nines earlier versions of air buses and 747s have been phased out and the noisy turbo props I won't mention the manufacturer of this plane case utter a swear word just think of the family and not meet the parents the friendship f-27 was a turbo prop it was a very noisy plane that's now been retired you get no real screaming you could really hear them okay however also many older planes when retired from passenger service are converted to air freight use so a lot of these noisy planes once the air that once they know we're used of passengers the use for freight okay the uis states that planes won't have to dump fuel although it's not dumping fuel is not common these days however if an aircraft has to dump fuel so they have to be a certain weight to land if they're too heavy they can't land so if an aircraft has to dump you where's it going to dump the fuel at the moment coming to mascot they usually dump it in the sea where they're going to dump fuel if they're landing at badgery's okay there have been certain things put forth arguments put forward for an airport such as job creation the claim of thousands of jobs may be maybe wildly optimistic up the majority of tourists still want to go to the city they still want to go the city they can easily come up by the mountains by train anyway which a lot of them do all that on driver convenience also stated as a another positive however driving to this proposed airport really will be an extra we're actually 25 minutes shorter than going to mascot at present and yeah we'll take 25 and 6 to go to mascot and badgers creek some roads from this papaya around this proposed year will be upgraded however in the case of wizards drive in the northern road these roads should have been upgraded without the need for an airport and the trouble is an airport without a rail access the ride's going to be congested the lack of the lack of rail access is definitely not convenient mascot will be much quicker by public transport on the topic right some array if some investments made it into interstate interstate rail was made there'd be less demand for an airport by investment and improving the existing infrastructure so 14 hours to get to brisbane four and a half hours to get the campbell roy rail and that president if you go to brisbane by uh right you get dumped at four in the morning which isn't hardly convenient okay it has been pushed for a very fast train but I think I think in the short term they should upgrade the existing infrastructure another 19 seconds okay in conclusion if the these flows flight paths cannot be altered without impacting on other airports in the sydney basin then perhaps this site is not really suitable for an airport this is just an isolated proposal this does not come as part of an overarching plan for the whole of western sydney this just comes as let's look at an airport we're going to build one and then there's a lot of stuff flows from that in terms of infrastructure that council von schulenberg's referred to I would like to see a total plan prepared that convinces me that there's a need for an airport in the first place because my belief is that major problem that we have in sydney is not getting to the place from somewhere else it's getting around the place once you're here so it's the travel within the base and not to it that's the the problem the the issue to be addressed that's our major infrastructure need at this time and that problem that we have in getting around is only going to be exacerbated by an isolated development of an airport with uh half thought out transport links leading to and from it that's my general opposition to it and I maintain that we have before us as you've pointed out a particular proposal and I have further objections to that particular proposal I have objections to a plan which brings all incoming flights up to 200 a day being projected over the inhabited part of the mountains of all the places in new south wales to fly the jets they're going to go down the great western highway these planes when they when they go over here where I live in uh in spring in big farm be closer to my house if they go at 5000 feet above sea level than the railway line is and I'm not far from the railway line if I want to catch a train I walk there um it's not not a big distance putting it another way and in the sporting metaphor much loved by uh by television commentators it's only 22 olympic swimming falls long that's the elevation and it starts to get scary my uh my other well I don't know if I have a love of swimming I have a love of afl and to put it in another uh framework it's less than 10 afl football fields long that's the elevation that they will be at and that scares me scares me absolutely quite deeply not just for myself but for everybody around me because that the impact is an impact not in a an already busy area which I know that has a heavy enough impact I have friends in places like leichhardt and merrickville I can't afford to live there but I can visit they hear airport noise against the background of busy streets and trains and whatever else I still hear those planes coming over and in an area like where we are in the lower mountains I'm going to hear that enormously it's the classic situation where in a busy environment you won't hear someone drop a hammer on into a tin bucket or something like that in a busy factory but if they do that outside my bedroom window at about three in the morning I'll hear it and my reaction will be one of some degree of shock as it will be if I get a plane going over my my place and more so if I get 200 of them coming over my place in which case I would probably think that all of them were actually the focker the brand that was referred to by by councillor von schulenburg just for the members of the audience he said focker okay it was not anything else okay there was no other word said I just and none was intended I'm not good at identifying aircraft a week 365 days a year but not around kingsford smith airport the equity argument that you referred to it's just not on it's just not fair and this is an issue that we've dealt with you know it's been dealt with several times in the past it's been put on back burners it's been around for decades now all of a sudden we have an eis that has to be commented on within 60 days I mean we give 30 days for an extension on a house for comments on honor development applications we gave five weeks for people to give feedback on whether or not we had green bins these are important issues but somehow I keep thinking of the 200 airplanes that are going to go pretty close to being over my house and I think 12 weeks just might not be enough time but firstly I'd like to thank the um speakers tonight and the people coming out tonight on this such a miserable night to come up here on such a very important issue like yourself I was 1999 and I had then long conversations with my friend and yours mr kerry bartlett who was the federal member from macquarie and I believe he's offered to give us a helping hand in in with this to facilitate meetings and so forth and we won the battle then but this is going to be a little bit hard because over the last year or so I've been going to every time this airport came up the council has had a briefing from the department and none of the runways were discussed when they broke the councils the proposed flight paths they came to speak to council and council officers only about community consultation and um it was only after I put up a matter of urgency that we got a consultation in spring because I had gone on to their web page and found that all the consultation that they were going to do was in the la in in on the plains there was none to be done in blue mountains until we kicked up a bit of a stink and then they came along and've I find that these people who prepared the eis and the department of planning they just can't get things right um for a prime example and if you read through the documents air services in new south wales or air services australia I should say I keep on making that mistake relating to flight paths are supposed to I repeat are supposed to when they develop these concepts for flight paths are supposed to consult with government that state and federal of course and councils and residents it's written in their documents have they spoken to blue mountain city council or the residents of the blue mountains no so there we go in councillor miles and myself a couple of weeks ago we went to parramatta on the invitation from the department to get a briefing on the eis and councillor miles and I walked out of that briefing no no would the wiser I wasn't anyway and um some of the issues that um the rural fire service mr corrigan raised here tonight I raised at that meeting and I spoke to and I've again because I don't think they really got what I was asking um because either had a conversation with david jones a royal fire service manager about what happens in the hawkery when there's a fire and they have all sorts of troubles for trying to get helicopters in when they've got a fire down the bottom there because of the rat base I asked that question how will that those flight paths affect the blue mountains they couldn't answer the question they had no idea you have to ask to air services and we couldn't even get a response out of our services you know but anyway the only good thing is that one of the staff read through the eis air services australia are supposed to consult because they say this is a draft I got my doubts but they're supposed to consult with the residents and the council but you know this might take more than 10 years before they start doing that you know so I've got a whole lot of concerns with this and I will do everything try to change the flight path because I believe that those flight paths can be put somewhere else not over our area the residents of the blue mountains moved here because this is a residential area the blue mountains is residential it shouldn't be something for flight paths because one of the things that in all the briefings that we had and even at west rock um council fell with me then that we were talking about the the runways and the flight paths and they were talking about flight paths going over the development areas of um uh and the rural areas of camden thank you thank you um I am not as eloquent as most of the speakers were tonight I will try not to repeat the things that you have all covered which I think are all the major issues I just wanted to say that from my perspective when I had a read through that eis I was extremely disappointed I'd been hoping for something that would actually answer the questions be sensible cover all the ground it needed to cover it did no all the rfs um and hazard reduction issues it's a huge thing where is it nowhere people have raised the curfew any discussion about that not really no um but the biggest one from my point of view the biggest thing that concerned me about it was the complete silence about the effect of all of a sudden having 200 planes a day you know or building up to 200 planes a day over your house there is like nothing there is nothing about that and I just think it's unconscionable of them to have produced a document that does not deal with one of our absolutely critical vital concerns is the effect that those planes will have on our way of life our homes our families our communities what we do every day where we live every day what we where we have chosen to live and why we have chosen that there's a fair amount of talk about the world heritage area I'm not sure that I trust anything they say they're either about plants water air but certainly there is nothing there planes a day might make a bit of a difference to how you live in your home and everything about your daily life um the only other thing is what counselor phil said that really annoyed me was that 60-day period that's beyond ludicrous um so that's all I want to say thank you all very much and we will we will fight for you for us for everybody else in the mountains thank you if you really listen you might hear crickets or my wife's snoring because that's the sound from my house in windmilly my front yard my backyard every night every day of the year that is the sound of silence now I'm being told by the boffins that hastily cobbled together this ticker box eis that 55 decibels that's 60 decibels in the occasional 70 decibel intrusion into what you've just heard is of minimal and acceptable impact so the experts suggest that 55 decibels is a conversation a bit of a vague description for mine is it a pub conversation at midnight come what may I don't five minutes at 60 decibels we have a busy office at 70 decibels of passenger car hour after hour increasing always increasing forever increasing to ultimately we read 85 flights an hour by 2063. read it and weep folks you are worthless your lifestyles mean nothing to the people who drew those lines on those maps mr mayor I came to this council fighting for what was a very important lifestyle issue in springwood at the time compared to the threat to our chosen way of life that has just hit the table that issue is an atom on a giant's fingernail this cuts to the fabric of who we are and why we choose to call the blue mountains home this issue is about our heart and soul let's be very clear we live in a world heritage listed wilderness area that is globally unique we live in the bush which is both spectacular and peaceful and now all that is threatened let's not beat around the bush this is all about politics colleagues this airport was a captain's pick by our former pm that you are to accept that this airport is going to be built we as a community must galvanize our collective wills into having these destructive flight paths changed the decision to send them over blackstone glenbrook waramu mount riv yellow rock springwood valley heights and windmilly is a political decision undoubtedly our lack of urban density put a target on our towns one can only conclude that the seat of macquarie is seen as expendable I put to you that is that a decision was made to concentrate all the pain on one area with a relatively small population let us be absolutely clear on this this will be a white hot election issue next year the absence of equity is further galling mr mayor we in the west have always known that our leaders have not seen us as being equal to those living in the east of course there will be no curfew for our airport after all the planes are quieter these days and us bogans are deep sleepers it is an insult to every resident of the blue mountains in greater western sydney he'll be around the clock we're now well held inner city colleagues here we go continue to be protected by a curfew this is unacceptable and cannot stand the lack of noise sharing for this airport is further evidence of the politics behind the decision ladies and gentlemen the draft eis concluded that among other things there is no significant impacts are expected to the greater blue mountains world heritage areas geodiversity biodiversity water catchment or recreation and tourism values I say nonsense to this and whoever wrote it clearly does not enjoy bush walking camping canyoning mountain bike riding trail running rock climbing or even the act of sitting on a ledge in quiet reflection for their recreation eco tourism and busy flight paths are uneasy bedfellows and this will have economic impacts put simply the whole point of these activities is to escape the world we have built not to look up and see the 307 qantas quite from jakarta is running five minutes late and look it's dumping fuel because in theory it will vaporize in the air before it hits us as long as the temperature martin's lookout and grosshead south falkenbridge point and sassafras gully swamp and birdwood gully and all of the secret water holes in hidden gems of my chosen home now stuff that mr mayor these places are all worth fighting for let's rise up against his madness and fight like we are on death row for our quality of life faces the gallows if we fail this eis is an intellectually lazy deceitful piece of garbage that has been cobbled together by some people who have betrayed those people who think the airport is a bad idea those people who think the airport is a good idea and those people who aren't sure and would like more information it is an absolute disgrace and whatever your view on this is the best way to advance your goals whatever they may be is to shoot down this shabby document and I like it enlighten some of the many ways that it is shabby and I actually won't have time even with the full five minutes um that we have here tonight so start with a little bit of to the same room in parramatta that we went to a few weeks ago uh to hear about why we needed an airport at badgery's creek this was a surprise it had been off the agenda for a long time and a number of people at the western sydney business chamber said this is how it has to be some people in fact some pretty senior people from the department of infrastructure and redevelopment were at that meeting tagging along those same people were at every single meeting that I went to afterwards and those people that department have been pushing this airport from that time to now and guess what they're the ones who put the eis out and they're the ones who are going to judge the submissions now we don't do that we don't do that in this council but imagine that we said to a developer you take all the submissions you determine whether they're right or wrong and you let us know and we'll just take that off and that is the expectation that the department has and going to be a very political issue and the deputy prime minister needs to take leadership on this because this eis is utterly unacceptable and we're going to explain for a very large number of reasons why and I think process even though it's about the planes it's about the noise but it's about the process that got us here how did this happen who made these decisions well what are those decisions we could talk about and this I'll table these documents for uh inclusion in our submission mr mayor but what are the baseline particle readings that we have in blackstone so we can understand what effect it might have these planes flying over there's nothing about that there's 158 sensitive receptors the eis tells us here's a map of them not one of them is west of the nepean river so you won't know the effect that these aircraft flying overhead will have on your area the second one which I was quite disturbed about is the issue of why are these flight paths like they are please the impact of kingsford smith we don't want to cross paths you wouldn't want these planes to bump into themselves councillor would you no of course I said no no no can I have a look at those flight paths please dear bureaucrat no we don't have them look on the uh sydney airport website well I did and they weren't there I ended up going to council vander clay's favorite uh group of people air services australia and kind of found something but as one pilot and councillor shrub informed me the flight paths are actually quite fluid they can go in a number of different locations so just going on what I know from personal observation and the fantastic apps that we have these days that tell you where every plane is and please get one flight tracker or plane finder 24. um it seems that they head south out of sydney and then they head for the beacon which is just over here at shell corner and then from wherever they may be or they may go north out of sydney and at what heights well there's no information whatsoever about that until you go to air services australia's and this is not the eis this is not information contained in the eis you've got to go to external sources to find information to inform your view of what the eis is about it turns out that the separation between aircraft must if they're under 29 000 feet must be how much thousand feet between aircraft one thousand feet it is one thousand feet three hundred and five meters is the standard for aircraft to be away from each other so they don't bang into each other councillor now I'm thinking that if they can get that high out of mascot they may not actually be going to impact on what happens there in badgery's creek I think the department should have told us these things I think they should have informed the public so the people could make an informed decision instead of having to go and research this stuff themselves this is a disgrace that people are expected to make full-on decisions about forever more and probably at all hours of the day without having the correct amount of information we don't know about pollution but they didn't even know an answer to council evander clay's question about the issue of uh bushfires I'll leave it there mr me because there will be so much more I hold a commercial pilot's license so um I'm not averse to a little aircraft knives per se but not over our world famous blue mountains not a holocaust of never ending aircraft noise 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year we want birds not boeings over blackstone we want fresh air not air buses in the mountains and not to labour the point too much mr mayor we want quietness not qantas listed noise is usually defined as unwanted sound and its perception can be characterized as a subjective reaction to a physical phenomenon so noise apart from being unwanted is highly subjective and there's an abundance of research worldwide on that subject in relation to noise under flight paths and around airports and that are used when assessing aircraft and airport noise for instance the day night average level descriptor is based on an average hourly ambient noise level over a 24 hour period however this is very interesting a plus 10 decibel penalty is applied to night time those hours between 10 pm and 7 am this night time penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as if they were subjectively twice as loud as daytime exposures the same sound level with increased evening and night time sensitivity is perceived as being twice the volume as during the day now if we've seen and heard the rhetoric coming out of the draft eis no need to worry it's okay as councillor lou ketty said it's just conversational level well I put it to you here tonight and considering the 10 plus 10 decibel penalty I've just mentioned would it be exceptional to you to have random people engage in conversation approach and pass your bedroom window at regular intervals throughout the night every night noise perception I would suggest is influenced by who either grew up here or chose to move here have a reasonable expectation that the nighttime hours would be quieter than if they were living in the city most of us who choose to live in the blue mountains and commute to sydney for work expect to be able to enjoy a certain a level of tranquility at home especially during the night time it's called amenity mr mayor amenity be described as the pleasantness or attractiveness of a place in fact the draft eis mentions the term amenity no less than 250 times the draft eis also concedes that long-term airport development would change the amenity of communities and recreational areas in proximity and under aircraft flight paths as a result of noise and visual impacts however in a separate section of the draft eis which ostensibly assesses the impacts on the greater blue mountains world heritage area the apparent findings are that the proposed airport would not have a significant impact on the area in particular it notes the indirect impacts of long-term airport operation would quote not result in an attribute of the property being diminished well I don't know how this assessment defines attribute of the property but if environmental and social amenity could be classed as attributes of a property and I argue they can then I call in to question their assessment and claim categorically that any plan for 24 7 flight paths over the mountain will result in amenity notably altered tick amenity damaged tick amenity degraded tick amenity lost tick this council and previous councils have worked hard and fought hard to ensure that certain provisions in our local environment plan or lep are maintained these provisions recognize and seek to protect the unique and sensitive natural environment and distinctive character of our built environment and its interface with the surrounding national park and we continue that fight presently so why should we not fight equally at heart as all or more or more to protect the airspace above us from a proposal that would render any secured lep provisions worthless we may as well concrete from lasting to lithgow so I'm going to run out of time I'm sorry so no matter where in the mountains united in opposing 24 7 aircraft flight paths over our mountains just want to say I'm absolutely impressed with the the community and that's why I'm very proud to represent it I share these concerns and I endorse what's been said here tonight but I'm right thing to speak tonight about the impact of the flight paths on our precious wilderness in the gross valley and I'm going to talk about it from a very personal perspective and I want us to remember at all times that the gross valley is part of the world heritage area that we've heard of tonight now some people like to say that things happen for a reason and in this instance maybe they do because just four days before the eis on the airport was released my friends managed to wean me off my mobile phone and take a two-day hike in the gross valley it was rather stressful being turning my phone off but what blows me away was that when I was walking there I had no inkling no thought ever entered my head beauty the majesty and uniqueness of the gross valley that it would be under threat that it would be potentially ripped apart by what I can only describe as a five-fingered claw of planes coming in over the gross valley 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days of the year during my walk as joan domicile eluded I saw many remarkable views cliff faces wildflowers snakes including two death adders kangaroos and a bright orange yabby I paid witness to australia's cultural heritage of our first peoples as I thought about the tracks I was walking on and how long they'd really been there along the edge of the gross river but what I remember most in the evening and going to sleep in my little tent in little blue gum forest and was my friends and I remarking on how quiet it was no highway noise no train noise just a chorus of frogs crickets and the boo book of an hour in a place where we felt like time stood still it never occurred to me on monday the 19th less than 36 to lockley's pylon that there would be a proposal before us to trash all of this having walked and slept in the gross valley and having looked at the flight paths I question and I quote the draft eis found that the construction and operation of the proposed airport would not result in the attributes of the world heritage area being lost degraded damaged or diminished whoever wrote this hasn't been to the gross valley I am not convinced as many others in this room tonight I am not convinced by these bureaucratic weasel words having walked in the gross valley I know that it will be impacted and our council report highlights that the experience of tourists and the impact on wildlife and the solitude of this unique area will be affected and people at the silly info session talked about they've been very proud puffy chess about how echo point isn't going to be impacted by planes flying overhead but the glossy brochures say nothing about blackheath and mount victoria let alone further down the mountains at falkenbridge point linden windmilly and woodford while not have to wait at echo point for a plane to move out of sight while you take your picture there's no such guarantees at govets leap lockley's pylon or fork and bridge point mr mayor I support this motion tonight because I cannot support the proposal for the flight paths for the second airport for sydney and if these are the only five viable flight paths that enable two airports in the sydney basin then I question the viability of a second airport located at badgery's creek and I want to emphasize that in closing that we are a city in a world heritage area and that we in the blue mountains are not just custodians and advocates for a piece of bushland that sits at the bottom of our street we are custodians and advocates for a stretch of wilderness that has a deep rich natural and current cultural heritage and that the world via its listing with unesco wants us to protect so thank you as you're no doubt painfully aware this continent that we're living on is the most bushfire continent most bushfire prone land in this country in this country and yet this eis does not address any of the concerns that mr carrigan has raised today and I think it's just um contemptible that they don't look at the the the how this uh this airport might impact and and hamper the activities of this fine body of men and women who defend our land on a regular basis on a regular basis it makes no mention how to manage the conflicting needs of commercial flights and airborne fire suppression activities particularly around the eastern merge points of the lo and the local government sections of the exclusion zone the draft acknowledges that much of the greater blue mountains world heritage area is currently impacted is currently impacted by up to 10 flights per day at much higher altitudes than the proposed outbound flights I can tell you and and we've heard testament today that residents all along the easterners garden the southern escarpment of the mountains particularly in my case in the in the top end have complained about the the uh the increase in that are inbound to kingsford smith airport and they're much higher than the outbound flights that will be coming up that that pathway those flights will be much noisier because the the planes are yeah they're flying upwards they're trying to escape the pool of the earth and so they'll be uh they'll be uh much noisier because they are ascending and they'll be operating day and night clearly the operators believe that the fauna and flora that like the fauna and flora of the world heritage area the residents of the blue mountains will become habituated to any elevation in noise in the long term they're quite this is the way that the uh the draft eis describes the high wilderness quality of the global blue the greater blue mountains world heritage area the wild and rugged landscapes diverse flora and fauna and opportunities for solitude self-reliant recreation and reflection are attributes that promote inspiration serenity and rejuvenation of the human mind and spirit such experiences are highly valued by both individuals and our society that's how they describe that thing going to be shattered that a great national asset will be squandered and that a world heritage a rare world heritage will be diminished by hundreds of aircraft thundering overhead day and night we don't we don't have to make that choice that jane domicile referred to between our mother and our father between the urban and the natural environment we don't have to make that choice we have to stop this airport I'm rising tonight to briefly speak against the flight path proposed in the draft eis for batteries creek airport over the years mr mayor we have to be debated badgers creek on three occasions and the vote has always ended the same way 11-1 against the airport with myself being the one voice in favour and that is still my view however that is not what tonight is about tonight mr mayor it's different tonight we as a community can come together the flight paths merging over blackstone is the ultimate betrayal by the bureaucrats from the ivory tower of the department of infrastructure and regional development a lot of people have included only to have this good faith thrown in our faces this is simply not good enough my response to the flight paths is not a case of nimbyism before last week no one could have predicted that the flight pass would have been placed where they are these indicted indicative flight paths defy logic of all the routes of all the locations they chose to cover the blue mountains they chose to put the merge point of five flight plus flight plus over blackstone in my f in my opinion these should be moved and the merge point should be shifted over on uninhabited land over the past three years I have consistently said that we need to be at the table the blue mountains needs to be front and center advocating for the best deal from badgers creek airport the current proposal isn't the best deal we got the short end of the stick if we do nothing but oppose the airport we will get nowhere supporters and opponents need to put their differences aside sit at the government's table and oppose these flight paths I forward to going and being able to grill the public servants responsible as to inflicting the lower blue mountains with these flight paths however I was greeted by nothing more than posters and fliers mr mayor I'll be submitting my own personal submission to the uh submission against the eis as well as this camp alongside this council's I'll be writing and lobbying the prop from the prime minister down I'll be standing with the community of the blue mountains fighting the proposal that the bureaucrats of the department have inflicted upon us
Very very exciting day today we're going to learn about water quality we're going to learn about water bugs we're going to learn about hanging swamps are going to learn about giant dragonflies because we've got some unique critters that live in this catchment that don't exist in very many places community so this is a very very important segment and we're delighted you're going to come today to help us solve a key Gnaeus aquatic crime so here's the story on the 7th of july 2012 over 1,000 dead and dying crayfish were found in jamison creek which is just over there so it was a catastrophe there was something had happened instantly to kill lots and lots of stuff in the water your job today is to find out why however here is the blue mountains swamp community this is a very rare community we've only got approximately 3,000 hectares of this in the entire Blue Mountains it looks like a green sort of grassy Valley but it's essentially just a huge sponge full of water the beauty and then instead of running off immediately down and and into the into the creek systems it holds it here up in the in the headwaters of the valleys and then releases it slowly over time what we're going to do now is just do a little bit of a soil testing on some of these samples and we'll just sort of see just how acidic this type of soil is compared to some normal soil of a port along as well this is this is the swamp one look at the difference in the color only below so there were down to four and a half and some of the higher some of them were lower depending on what he got them from yeah that was really interesting I didn't realize this swamp here was really really old 10 million or ten thousand years old and yeah it's really interesting to see all the old generations and everything it's been through like I wouldn't think it had that much history but it does we're going to spread out around the water bug as biological indicators of how healthy the lake is and they're also finding all sorts of good stuff for finding freshwater shrimp catus flies make flyers dragonflies damselflies all sorts of diversity in theirs but I have caught like three giant shrimp and then there's icollector the godfather of shrimp fish so this is just a nice simple but effective test of how cloudy or clear the water is so if it's really really dirty and cloudy we'll only be able to put a little bit into the tube and still see the three wavy lines on the bottom in the year 2000 there was a declaration made by UNESCO of the greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area some of the UNESCO delegates were worried about the impacts at our city being the only city in the southern hemisphere within a World Heritage Area on the water quality on the downstream world heritage area so the impacts of urban runoff were identified by UNESCO as a potential threat to the World Heritage listing so when the water flows out of the lake and it flows down it end up where's that big lake on the other side of Mount solitaire that all of the water in the upper it ends up in work and a damn now if you're down in Sydney in fact in you if you're in the lower mountains all the way up to falcon bridge you're drinking water from war again but damn dude you want to be drinking polluted water would you want to be drinking nice clean water nice clean water so it's up to us because we live at the headwaters of the catchment to look after the water quality wentworth falls like providing so old the water for sydney and all around that area ish rights home to thousands of different animals it is a place of great environmental and accordionist either all naked in here I crush it between your fingers and smell it yeah that little plant is a baronial if you so you have looked at the biodiversity in that little piece of course those how much again we can be out with 66 and which was where most common gorgeous says hot boronia has become but if I compare that with the biodiversity over there where all the weeds are what happens to biodiversity when we get weeds whole less is Pete Smith we've been learning about like plants and animals and weeds and what's not weeds and good and bad plan we went over and did there's a little set up back there and it's um like a whole you know you can flush a little talk shows where the sewage goes and things like that and yeah that's cool but all of the stations you looked at this notion of interrelatedness or interconnectedness you looked at the interconnectedness of what we do at the top of the catchment and what that means for the catchment downstream everything we do up here impacts down there you know just let's say that's how we got a cat in this ecosystem you'll probably attack that poor and the child look yeah not just this like but a lot of other lakes as well because they all connect and so if anything happens can affect everywhere else I have no idea but it could be the solution to stormwater introduced species probably killed them off when you build house lawless chemicals and materials can get into the water and kill animals that's what I think it is but I don't know yet all the people met Jamison Creek didn't have a idea of these issues and everything and maybe one day just got too much and the crayfish couldn't handle table I think are there was some pesticide being used a big apartment complex and it rained obviously and then that the chemicals came into the jamison Creek and killed many many crayfish and also other water bugs and damaged the system question to you then given what you've learned today how did that testifies get from that block into it will go down good storm water if to the later then well you'll kill so let's have a look what's happened to our web so drop a beat that's you affect it so anybody who is immediately affected drop and I've got about how me just as a person and as a community can work together to create a better environment for one everyone to save water and electricity and that's a bonus for everyone there cuz this and three just improve the quality of the whole the general environment well I've learned it's important to make sure that you don't have storm water right off from your home which goes strain to the environment and just something like having a garden no oh just making sure you don't pollution do all those things it couldn't really greatly help with her for a dogfish I enjoy today a lot because I find the environment fascinating and I love animals and creatures and things like that so I had a wonderful day you
The beautiful Blue Mountains a unique city set within a world heritage National Park the LGA covers over 1,400 square kilometers of which only eleven percent is privately owned and developed over 76,000 residents live across 27 towns and villages an area of extreme vulnerability for natural disasters such as bushfires wind storm and flooding it's also a major international and domestic tourism destination while Blue Mountain City Council is committed to building a successful future for the city a unique nature presents us with a distinct set of challenges our planning documents identify these challenges and strive to set of balance between our community's priorities and the resources we need to achieve them integral to our long-term planning is our workforce management strategy which determines who we need so we can deliver the services agreed with our community however providing these Human Resources has its own challenges such as skill shortages and a need for specialists in unique fields this can be difficult however as our close proximity to Sydney means many skilled residents are drawn away freighter employment opportunities elsewhere and with local government seen as we have to work harder to educate a potential workforce on the benefits of working with us is Blue Mountain City Council an employer of choice because we lead the way with programs which improve our communities quality of life and we continually win awards in areas as diverse as the environment and land use planning infrastructure because our leaders are committed to making good business decisions which lead to the organization's success and because professional development for our staff is really important and we provide a diverse range of career opportunities across 30 business areas being an employer of choice has a wide range of benefits not only to the council but to the community our employees and the industry as a whole benefits to the council include higher productivity great in 230 of skills and a harmonious workplace where everyone is working towards a common goal benefits to our staff include a great place to work which is secure and often close to home the personal satisfaction in knowing that make a difference to our community and the availability of extensive career development opportunities the community also receive the highest quality outcomes possible they'll be confident they're receiving value for money which all means that we much more satisfied with the council where are we situated now I'll be armed with everything we need to go forward and look for the right employee we've spoken with our current staff and reviewed our Workforce Planning from that we developed an employee value proposition that links directly our community's needs with the people and the skills essential for us to achieve our long-term goals we need to actively promote Blue Mountains Council as an employer of choice so a career with the council is front of mind in those people we want to attract and retain we can do this by taking the following actions ensuring consistent branding to identify out as an employer of choice and promoting this message to external media channels having a presence at career expose so we extend our brand identity beyond our council boundaries and by working with the lgm a so that local government is promoted as an industry of Troy across the whole of Australia a the next step and get our message out to the people we need on board and remember Blue Max capsule is great place to work you
Basically there's been people here my elders here that kind of gotten the direct people they've looked out beautiful for many many many many years and now I guess it's our job and see how job is the next generation to take care these lagoons in the smallest ways we can we're gonna share some of the world's oldest paint in the world have you ever seen the oldest paint in the world guys yeah we did some our Korean you know the best thing about this article I prepared some this morning and when I went to wash it up Wayne's I went washed it straight in that Lagoon do you think I heard that Lagoon you know work is that the paint that comes from Mother Earth that's gooney goon they come from mother guys back to mother earth everybody was very excited about today because we've kind of been waiting for it for a long time biodiversity is all about where we live or where we don't live for that matter all the living creatures not even not whole system together exists and you affect something in that system and it can upset everything else that's part of that system do you want to pass the string around that might be so we need to quickly come up with some different things that make us related to each other so well here would you be related to around the circle mas mas would live on a rock that's very good so keep hold of your string you need to live on something Moss The Rock says that you live on it but you could also live on a tree the web of life game teaches the kids that everything is interrelated so you might have water you might have trees you might have birds if you take one of those things from the system or in fact even if you add key Bamba into the system which in the case of the lagoon it's completely took oxygen away from the lagoon which meant other things got affected so when you tug on the string everyone feels that tug so it connects the kids with one whole system now every time we do this game it has a different pattern altogether completely different pattern it's beautiful there's something that happened here at the Glenbrook lagoon that that was really bad for it we don't have it here now but we've started to grow in the lagoon they showed a picture of how kaboom bar can spread it's huge it looks like water lilies except no flowers no nicey-nice it's amazing the kids really get the fact that they can create a beautiful web and how something simple can be added to that or taken away from it can affect that system so simply never ever judge a lily by its flowers this station is about water bugs and water quality the kids are at the moment looking in the trays at two different samples of water bugs that we've collected here at the lagoon and also as a comparison at one brook creeks down in the national park so what they're doing is they're looking at the different types of bugs they find how sensitive those types that information to make an assessment about how healthy the lagoon and the creeks are any interesting shrimp and that have you worked out what that thing is very good looking at that you wouldn't think that's a baby dragon for widgets I love their delight seen their voices and on their faces when they start to discover things like the cata Squires which look like they look like sticks but then they start moving in a little head and legs pops out and they keep what is it we found a diving beetle yeah I was surprised too how many different species of animals they're actually here in the lagoon and everywhere else we have to build we adults are going to come around and we're going to visit your Park and we're going to ask you some questions about the sorts of things that you've got on offer at your park and I might be a bush Walker I might be really interested in nice big trails that go for five hours I have to see if this is the kind of Lagoon and it's got some trees in it and it has an endangered tree I didn't know so much rubbish went and went into those and got us and like polluted all that I didn't know that before so does that tug so it connects the kids with one thing going wrong in that biodiverse system can affect the whole system now every time we do this game it has a different pattern altogether completely different pattern is beautiful there's something that happened here at the Glen Brook Lagoon that's that was really bad for it we don't have it here now but we've started to grow in the lagoon they showed a picture of how kaboom bar can spread it's huge it looks like water lilies except no flowers no nicey-nice it's amazing the kids really get the fact that they can create a beautiful web and how something simple can be added to that or taken away from it can affect that system so simply never ever judge a lily by its flowers this stations about water bugs and the trays at two different samples of water bugs that we've collected here at the lagoon and also as a comparison at Glenbrook Creek down in the national park so what they're doing is they're looking at the different types of bugs they find how sensitive those types are to pollution and disturbance and then they're using that information to make an assessment about how healthy the lagoon and the creeks are and it's interesting the shrimp and that have you worked out what that thing is very good looking at that you wouldn't think that's a baby dragon floor would you I love their delight that seen their voices and on their faces when they start to discover things like the Cata squires which look like they look like sticks but then they stop moving in a little head and legs pops out and they keep scope ow what is it a diving beetle many different species of animals they're actually here in the lagoon and everywhere else we have
Council is pleased to announce the draft local environment plan 2013 an elemental local environment plan is a legal document prepared by council approved by the government that controls the land we have in the city and how can we developed an LEP basically guides planning decisions for the local government local council the draft filling the local environment plan has been prepared by council in response to a government requirement that we have a standard template and oily please in the state they want to look the same our new draft LEP is essentially conversion of our old Ellie please into a single comprehensive plan for the city of Blue Mountains and this council has made a considerable effort to ensure that we continue to maintain our strong environmental protections while committing some development to occur in the future obviously you want to find out more and the best way to do that is to have a look at councils your say website or make an appointment to see one of our planning staff they're friendly they're accessible and they're there now thanks very much
Thank you for for being here this evening my name's Lee Morgan and I'm the director of development and planning oh sorry development and customer services with Blue Mountains Council this is the first of four schedule information sessions there will be a bit more information at the end about about the others but first of all I'd like to acknowledge that we're meeting on traditional Aboriginal land and that this is the traditional lands of the dog and the gonna go of people Blue Mountains Council pays its respect to elders Pope past and present of the blue mountains and of peoples of other areas that's a quick overview of the agenda for this evening it's it's fairly challenging as indicator this is one of four sessions which are looking to try and focus on some of the key themes and in the plan in the new draft plan before moving off that slide I will reinforce that the making of a submission is really critical value adding opportunity here it's going to be important for us to be able to it's not it's not simply a theoretical exercise with it so there's a lot involved in in producing a draft like a local environmental plan like this and we really value the feedback so just looking at an introduction this evening is very much about trying to do a general overview to give people an understanding of the structure and approach and provide more opportunity indicate what opportunities there are for more information and the other services that will be providing as a as a team it's not about site specific issues and you'll hear more towards the end about about what the opportunities are that they're being provided to provide more site-specific advice to people the the sessions the presentations are being recorded and the PowerPoint will also be up on on the site so there will be that resource for those people who are interested but to who can't be here this evening or for those if you don't have to take copious copious notes we've got here tonight to the a number of members of the planning team draft plan and there will be three other presenters and eternal who's the City Planning Manager and michelle maher who is a senior strategic planner and kim barrett who's a senior planner in in the development assessment area but we are working across the organization as a team and you'll see some different faces throughout the work on the plan if we have a very quick look there at the background we know that we've got current local environmental plans lfp for 1991 and 2005 and some of you will be aware that 91 and 2005 are our key parent instruments 2005 it was originally proposed that we would then roll 1991 into 2005 the standard instrument order was gazetted only about less than 12 months after 2005 came into being and council had still been working on its LEP 1991 development and rolling into a consolidated 2005 type instrument when the Department of Planning changed their view on that approach and not much more than 12 months ago gave a deadline to have the draft instrument prepared in the fact the standard instrument format and is change the scope of what normally would be a planning exercise for preparing a parent instrument so it's very much about translating and implementing our current framework into the standard instrument so how we gon about it certainly we're looking nonetheless even though we're required to adopt now the standard instrument format we're looking to take the same planning framework approach that is articulated in LEP 2005 and in many ways also in LEP 1991 particularly in terms of environmental protection and roll those and roll out a similar approach right across the city LEP 2005 actually developed a lot of the mapping resources to a far higher degree of resolution accuracy and across many more criteria but certainly LEP 1991 established a lot of the key principles that were taken forward into LEP 2005 and has still been retained and you know this city is still aiming to achieve an appropriate balance that place a significant emphasis on the value of environmental protection and protecting our our our built character as well we see those as being very critical therefore allowing for an appropriate second principle is we do understand and see the value in in converting and using the standard instrument format wherever we've been able to and some things are really quite directly translatable and and that that's reflected in the plan but the third principle is not everything could be directly inserted into use the format and and wording of the provisions in the standard instrument and there we've needed to use a best fit approach to get out to maintain our key planning framework for the city and you know some examples of that are Le Pen 1991 uses no subdivision designations or consolidation designations that's gone but we're achieving it biasing approach which is using minimum lot areas or lot averaging so there that that that's been used fairly widely through the instrument as well there has been some introduction of new policy but only to either reflect what's been happening externally in legislation and within state type other plans but also where there's been some visibility of of issues at the counseling community level and all we've been duped but it's pretty modest what's very modest and it is identified in planning proposals in the planning proposal which is one of the resource documents you'll hear a little bit more about before just giving an outline under standard instrument I wanted to reinforce some of the the key drivers for the council in terms of representation we've needed to make and a case we've need to make to the department to accommodate and I should say retain some of the key planning provisions parts of our framework which we saw as critical to achieving the outcome and outcomes for blue mountains that are not part of the standard instrument and we've had to argue each of these through so for example our planning instruments at the moment require compliance with the relevant objectives of the local plan and of the zones that is a stronger test than taking into consideration which is the approach that's taken in the standard instrument we that's but that's being accepted up to this point and where we're hopefully that will continue right through critical matter as well this this city's done quite a bit of work on trying to identify significant vegetation communities that's evolved and become more and more sophisticated and our mapping is is also developed and applied now with two across the LEP 1991 air is where there was very little LEP mapping across those areas previously however we've got a very complex landscape and biodiversity and the and the the ecological communities that support that highly diverse in the Blue Mountains it's not being possible and we don't assert that the mapping has picked up all the significant vegetation communities and therefore it's essential in our view in the end the department ultimately accepted this as part of the draft instrument we feel it's absolutely essential so that the schedule vegetation communities and I think Michelle will talk about those in a bit more detail but they are in there and they need to be in there and they give we've got both locally significant communities but also threatened species conservation act communities listed in that schedule and they receive the the same sort of consideration flexibility in relation to zones being able to extend to adjoining zone this is an area where we have actually asked for more flexibility than is in the standard instrument at the moment we've got environmental protection zones on quite a because of that complex landscape you know we've got a lot of gullies and steep land and water courses at the rear of quite a few lots we've got a lot of what's known as splits own land where we're trying to identify environmental least sensitive land it's not suitable for development in the front of a lot by the road is usually the area we want to retain that that's where the development occurs but once again as we as I've mentioned the mapping can't always be a hundred percent accurate at the scale that we need it to apply and therefore we want to retain the flexibility that is currently in the lfp to allow an intrusion of a potential development into ten meters into an environmental protection zone provided that it still need to amend the standard instrument for that to go forward but their support for that I think it makes a lot of sense the other couple of things are the the high threshold test for storm water quality entering the Blue Mountains as that says World Heritage Area that's that's one of the reasons why we are so strong on Environmental Protection and wanted to retain that and we believe it's in the community interest to do that the standard instrument test on on water quality was not anything like the current one which is basically requires that it not that development not either have a neutral or beneficial effect on water quality it must not degrade water quality because of the sensitivity of our receiving environment and because of the difficulty of managing I think incremental impact if you don't have quite a high order test so that has been accepted as well and probably lastly but not leastly are those matters which go to the built character and the preservation of the character of our of our villages we've argued probably the'll talk about a little bit more has been probably the most controversial one and the most difficult one to argue and possibly that at highest risk I would say but also we wanted to argue in the period housing areas and village and town localities planning where we had previously had placed based outcomes set for particularly Townsend villages and multi-unit housing areas and whilst it's not quite in that form as we've said we've had to take some different approaches to getting the same outcomes we think come that with those things now in the standard instrument or the draft standard instrument it is reasonably well set for going forward and still achieving the planning outcomes that the council has been seeking and it's not just this current council it's been really this is the third Council in a row which is argued strongly with the state government about wanting to retain the outcomes for our planning framework that's just a quick overview I'm not going to go through that as I said it's a standard instrument and that's can go to a nowhere to expect to find different types of controls and there are some commonalities that run through all which should be of assistance out to our community in understanding how land use planning works certainly the definitions all need to be the same across the state where the land use definitions which go to things like defining what's permissible development what's prohibited development the loungers table has to be in a standard form we think that's a retrograde step in a way because the matrix was a very useful thing and we can still produce on a matrix but it's it's as that were outside of the planning instrument so that we can it allows you to read on agreed quickly across zones and down land uses to see what's permissible where and and that's part of the resources that we've got an exhibition the equivalent zones are something which everyone is required to adopt one of an or the relevant palette and apply to their locality we've managed to do that apart from that one zone zone which is often found close to in the residential areas close to the town village sentence and we know some of them very well so particularly South lura around glenbrook or two examples where you've got traditional garden settings with housing within that the gardens dominate very highly valued character areas in our view there was not an equivalent zone which would deliver that and we did that's why we've argued we need a new zone d LEP 2013 is also having to adopt there are compulsory or mandatory clauses which we must either adopt or if they're not applicable you you need to note them it's not applicable otherwise you can you can adopt some optional settled clauses it might be being used in various other places and then they would encourage us to use the same format of the clauses and then we can insert local causes but they ask us to do this in a very structured way within the instrument so that people who know instruments will can navigate their way around it the maps regretfully we think let's there and they're also meant to be looked at digitally not in hard copy but it does mean you can you can zoom out or zoom in zoom into height quite a high level of resolution accuracy just very briefly when you look at the instrument the color coding tells you what clauses and provisions fall into those different categories I was talking about so the black ones are the compulsory ones which we must adopt the red ones talk about some of the things that we've got optional but if we do choose to do and they want us to use a standardized format as much as possible and then we've got the green ones which are those that we are seeking and they're quite different in their Blue Mountains things that were often to go in that wasn't there for you to read it's really just to give you an overview of what you could expect to see and the fact sheets etc that are around the back as well as the material online helps with that so before I I pass what the standard zones and and a mean so we do need to apply a palette of standard zones to our current zones and there are quite good zone equivalents the table shows you know what the current zone is in Le Pen 1991 and what it is in in LEP 2005 and what the equivalent zone is in the standard instrument and that we were really quite satisfied with with most of those but as I was saying the residential character conservation zone we have argued in at the eleventh hour the department did agree for this to go as part of the exhibition but they have indicated that they will need to further consider this and and we will need to make submissions as part of the after the exhibition we've got public comment as part of the final submissions on the plan but we would say if you look at the planning reforms and the green paper on the planning reforms which is now back up I suppose about 18 months or so maybe even two years the government itself identified a need for a better argue that there's a good basis there for that so with no further ado I'll hand over to michelle maher Thank You Michelle okay so now we're going to talk about environment and the draft le paid 2013 to give an idea I'm going to explain the general approach we've taken to environmental issues in looking at coming up with draft LEP 2013 and we've sort of split them into three different types of approaches we've taken so I'll take us through those for instance we have existing environmental policy from our existing le PS that's both LEP 91 and LEP 2005 and as you can see there with my name you be able to bring it across into draft LEP 2013 in a variety of ways equivalent zones develop excluded land protected areas schedule of significant vegetation and I'll go into these a bit more detail as we go through we've also managed to bring in some existing Council environmental policy which isn't currently within any of our le PS but which we are now taking the people can see it with in that format and the two in particular a landslide risk and flood planning and once again I'll go through these in a bit more detail we have taken the opportunity as Lee said principal for we have brought in some new environmental policy into the blue mountains and into this new draft instrument and there are a four there and I'll talk to most of those as we go through as well so first of all our existing LEP environmental policy and just to give you a bit of an idea and no need to take this all in it'll be online if you want to have a look our LEP 1991 zone environmental protection is now called zone e to environmental conservation in 2005 there was environmental protection private and environmental protection open space and they both been carried across once again into that same zone e to environmental conservation our development excluded land that exists under 91 and 05 has now been brought across into the draft instrument and claws 6.1 and these are all very interesting numbers this to look at it in the instrument itself and then our environmentally sensitive vegetation our schedules three and five in 91 and 05 consecutively are now within schedule six in the draft instrument and once again I just like to reiterate as Lee has already mentioned that's something we did have to negotiate with the department of planning on and it is considered by ourselves as quite still at risk it would be great to get feedback from the community through the submission process in support of that no other council as far as where oh where has the schedule of significant vegetation as part of their standard instrument version and we would see this as very essential to us moving forward into something that we believe gives us an equivalence to what we currently have in our planning controls now this is a bit of a tight slide so I'm just going to zero in on particular things we're looking at protected areas and protected area mapping now obviously we have quite a bit under LEP 91 and then under LEP 2005 but just to give you won't see within draft LEP 2013 those protected areas and or their maps which have coverage under other planning instruments won't be seen in the draft LEP 2013 the state government has an approach where they believe that you shouldn't be bringing in additional legislation into your planning instruments if it's covered under other legislation so things like our water supply catchment area and riverine scenic quality kuroda are covered by other pieces of legislation so you won't see those maps carried forward in LEP 91 we of a protected area court environmental constraint aria and that essentially shows slope and vegetation together as the one hatched area for those who've looked at LEP 91 and a familiar with how those protected areas work in the draft instrument we're looking at splitting up into two areas one specifically on slow and one specifically on vegetation so you'll see there'll be in two different maps but still the same intent is there but as Lee said we've actually got really quite good quality mapping that's been improved since LEP mapping across into 91 areas and make sure we have that same level and quality of mapping across all the lgo and in terms of the ecological buffer area protected area in LEP 20 2005 that's been split into two types of maps again so the intent is still there but there'll be in two different places it'll still carry controls it will still give us protection through protected area clauses but there are two slightly different places canopy conservation which is underneath LEP 1991 is now included within the vegetation constraint area mapping so that is a individual protected area map that's now be included in another now in terms of some of councils existing council environmental policy that we're bringing in first up we'll just look at landslide since the early 80s we've had lamb slip actually a landslip policy that applies to the mounts in particularly because of the basalt soil there so we got advice from the den equivalent to the chiro csiro I think that we needed to include that so we have it sits within existing council environmental plan before so it's the I don't know optical that darker caramel color there so that's showing the area in the mount is covered by landslides and to give an idea that pink color is our slope constraint area as mapped we've also taken the opportunity to bring across existing mapping that we've done for flood planning so to give an idea this is a snapshot of one of the maps in draft LEP 2013 showing the South Laura catchment mapping for flooding and the jamison creek catchment lighter blue area that's colored in solid that's what's called the flood planning area and if you want to delve down into the flood planning policy feel free but essentially it's the one in a hundred year flood plus 500 millimeters freeboard the darker blue line and I'll talked about a little bit later as well is what's called the probable maximum flood so but essentially this mapping has been reduced through a different type of process it's a flood study process as part of that there is probably been in this area when they've carried out that study will have been notified it was on you would have been asked to comment on it so but this is the first time we've brought it into our planning instruments so its existing policy it's out there it's been exhibited and adopted by council and has just been brought in and councils continuing this on for anyone who's in the lower mountains you'll be aware that there's some flood studies happening down there right now and also around faulconbridge so it's a rolling programme as we're going out over the years let's have a quick look at some new environmental policy that we've taken the opportunity to bring into the draft instrument so first up here we have fauna corridors that 6.2 is the clause within the draft LEP 2013 so that gives you a highlighter we can actually go and read it if you wish and to keep an idea it's the darker tan color and this is showing around Mount Victoria so this is based on wish to have a look there if you're aware of other mapping available to us that we can begin to use to bring in please let us know this is part of a submission process we're really relying upon the community to let us know some information that they're aware of this is a study we've used as a basis now we're also aware that there might be some other studies out there we've also taken the opportunity in clause 6.8 to bring in groundwater vulnerability now the source of this mapping it's very much the forks to me hawkesbury nepean catchment so I've got a little note there that says it really is based upon the recharge impacts for that river system it's not picking up the role of our local aquifers but we think it's a good first step so people will be able to see moderate moderately high and high Graham on a vulnerability and what's called up if application comes in in that area now this is where I refer back to that early slide the gap between our flood planning area which is the colored in light blue and the darker blue line for probable maximum flood essentially it's seen if you put in development with a high level of community risk and we're talking perhaps nursing homes or schools there's a clause in there that says you need to consider the fact that you are within an area below the probable maximum flood and you just need to take that on board when you consider that type of application now I'm going to move on into some of the background work we've been doing in terms of preparing these maps for the draft LEP 2013 in terms of le p 90 91 when the maps were done for that instrument for vegetation and this is what we're focusing on it was based upon some unpublished works information from national parks and wildlife as well as some Smith and Smith mapping that was available to us and essentially that was the information that was used to produce the LEP 1991 vegetation maps and I'm talking particularly the was being done or in the preparation of that aerial and infrastructure and infrared photos were taken for the entire LGA thank you that was back in nineteen ninety nine and then those photos were then interpreted for the entire LGA and that was done work from based on Smith and Smith again and also on Douglas and I've got there at the bottom right-hand part of the slide fact sheet 29 will go into a bit more information about this that work then was actually used to and became available for LEP 91 but as we talked about earlier we didn't the the maps for Ella p91 weren't necessarily updated to reflect that but the information was there as part of the DEA process for LEP 2005 they looked at those lands that were in within going to be within LEP 2005 they carried out validation of that mapping and some quadrat data work was done back in 2001 and from that they came up with the maps that were familiar with in LEP 2005 in terms of our vegetation as well we also have that so in reality if we didn't pick it up through the mapping the schedule is there to catch what wasn't picked up through the mapping as part of the DEA process so once again distressing that that aerial and infrared photography interpretation of all those of the the map of the photos have been available for the LGA since 2002 what we've taken in preparing the draft instrument in 2013 was to now look at our LEP 1991 lands and run a validation process over that that also built on work by Smith and Smith and also some work we've done internally on that and that's come up with the vegetation maps you're seeing and that have informed our other maps with in the draft instrument and as you've seen earlier we're also bringing across our schedule of significant vegetation to once again capture anything that has fallen through not being picked up in the maps in terms of the application of the e2 zone and in the draft instrument so the e2 zone is that um Environmental Conservation zone which is private and Environmental Protection open space under LEP 2005 so to give an idea obviously there is an environmental protection zone under LEP 1991 and in terms of that validating the mapping we then ran the e to Zion criteria that was used in LEP 2005 based on Environmental Protection private and environmental protection open space and we've extended that into our LEP 1991 lands now to give an idea the main things that we were looking for in the application of e 2 is the contiguous vegetated slopes steeper than thirty three percent and as well containing verified significant vegetation so this is vegetation that pilot study went out and had a look at made sure was there and also if it's within a watercourse corridor so we have some mapping around that so if you see that once again this is referring back to our the work we did in refine our significant vegetation in LEP 91 but the thing we have taken on board is obviously there still needs to be an adequate developer area on properties so they should still be an area on be developed and that d2 should still permit that where it sits on that land will there be e to on your land well for those under LEP 2005 with environmental protection private already on your land you'll probably find that that's been translated into e to pretty much as is there'll be minimal change for most if you're actually under alleppey 90 91 and you have EP already and if your property was reviewed as part of the field work that we carried out you might find that that EP has remained the same and being converted across into e 2 or there might be an increase or a decrease in that area on your land but you already know you've got some environmental protection on your land for some people within LEP 91 you'll find that you currently have no environmental protections shown on your land but now its proposed and that is picking up those constraints like slope and vegetation that we talked about earlier what will eat you on your land mean for you well obviously these are some of within that zone but really the thing to bear in mind is application of an e2 zone is generally recognizing land that's already quite constrained slopes of greater than thirty three percent speaking upland that's already heavily vegetated and so forth but please for those who've seen it for the first time on their land or you're seen it changed an application of where accessed on your land and you have a disagreement or you wish to raise some issues with us this is the role of the submission process and we encourage you to let us know and certainly this is what we are really encouraging people to do if you just wish to raise issues with us put it in the submission because we all consider that as part of that process and now I think we're moving on to heritage so I'll ask Kim Barrett to come up and talk to this hello so now we'll move on to the Heritage section of the presentation so as you are no doubt aware heritage is a big component of the Blue of our area and it's obviously extremely important to the community and so we have a number of provisions that already exist in LEP 1991 and also in LEP 2005 for the protection of heritage there's a couple of nice photos for you there so a heritage item may be stateless it or locally listed and we also have heritage conservation areas heritage items can be indigenous on on indigenous and the claws that we have under with a couple of causes that we have under the current la PS and the new clause that's under the draft LEP 2013 deals with both indigenous and non-indigenous indigenous heritage is primarily dealt with under state legislation and so the cause that's in the LLP protects it and then it refers us to state legislation to work with it from there so in terms of heritage items we have over 900 items in the Blue Mountains and there some of them are state listed and some of them are locally listed and we also have heritage conservation areas and then as you can see there from the slide period housing and they're living conservation so with the listed items the LEP recognizes our provides a legal framework or legal recognition for a building or it may be a place or an item of its heritage significance and then with the conservation areas similarly it recognizes an area in that sense as both as we mentioned before the period housing area is something that we have spoken to the department about and have sought to retain under the new LEP and we've been successful in carrying that across and in the same way living conservation area we've brought in effectively a new zone into the draft LEP that we believe replicates living conservation and there was nothing under the standard instrument which could do that adequately so here's an example of the way that heritage is currently mapped under 2005 and 1991 LEP s so you can see there we have individually numbered heritage items so obviously macquarie wrote in springwood so all of the items there have an individual number and they're prefaced by a couple of letters which denotes the location that is that the green item there are the state listed ones and the purple are locally listed the hatched area there is the conservation area that's the convention that we currently use and sorry there's a couple of little things there I can add and then with the period housing areas it's got a border there to denote where they are so as you can see sometimes those areas overlap but clearly they have a different assessment under the LEP but they clearly have heritage characteristics and we either have the individual items conservation areas or the period housing areas so as I mentioned before we've aimed to do the best fit or as a director translation as possible in from 2005 into the standard LEP so the objectives of the clause and the main components of the claws are consolidated in the standard instrument and reflect the provisions that were under 2005 for period housing this is the way that the mapping will appear under the draft LEP or as it appears under the draft LEP so the conventions are set by the Department Department color are period housing areas and they're on what's called a built character map the other thing that's on their village precincts and I'm not sure if you're aware of those but their particular areas that were identified under LEP 2005 within individual villages areas that had particular characteristics or areas that we wanted to protect in a particular way so they might have specific height limits or setbacks two boundaries things like that so those have also been retained under the El ap the objectives of those precincts are there still and the rest of the provisions will be moved across into a development control plan so as part of the seeking to retain the period housing areas and it's something that is relatively rare in the state there are a couple of lgas that have a similar provision but nothing quite the same so a period housing study was undertaken to review the value and integrity of all of the current period housing areas and if you wanted to look further attachment 15 to the planning proposal which is available here and areas to be removed and in the main that is due to either a significant character change in that area where a number of the original houses were either demolished or have been changed so significantly that they can't_''_2359.07 be read in the same way anymore aside from those three all of the other period housing areas are being carried across into the new LEP and interestingly the study identified that our period has housing areas have such a high quality is to be comparable to a lot of heritage conservation areas in other local government areas so as I think we've said a couple of times now essentially we've aimed to have a direct transfer of controls from LEP 2005 into the standard instrument format in terms of heritage items some listings may have been removed or changed a minimal change and again that's referred to in that same attachment the main reasons for that were either things if there was a for example if there was a duplicated listing which has occurred a couple of times or if something was mapped but it wasn was primarily to correct errors or anomalies rather than a reassessment of heritage value that was something that under the time constraints that we were given by the department to prepare the new LEP we couldn't achieve that type of revision in that time so the presentation as I've described in the maps is prescribed by the standard instrument and I'll show you a couple more examples of that it is proposed that the detailed heritage review of LEP 1991 be carried out in the next couple of years and we recognize that it would be an early amendment to the adopted LEP so a lot of work has been done like I mentioned before review of period housing areas so we have a good grounding in that and I think it's something that you know we could move forward with is an early amendment so this is how the Heritage map will it looks under the draft instrument so the hatching there or the red and white is conservation areas and then the individual items are in the brown all individually labeled and numbered in difference is there is no distinction now in mapping between state and local ii listed items and the way they appear in the schedule + schedule 5 of the early but the new LEP is that they're alphabetically-ordered rather than going from the top to the bottom of the mountains which it currently does under our LEP s so that's a closer view for you there so in the same way they're numbered with an early so the letters associated with the village that they're in and then a number that was something that we also pushed quite hard for with the department we wanted them to be individually recognized within the villages there and I think we're moving on to public exhibition good evening everybody um I just want to talk you through the exhibition process and also how to make a submission so following excuse me around 15 months of activity council adopted the draft LEP 2013 back in September and that was sent straight to through to the department and they issued their gateway determination on the first of november this year process before christmas that's hence why we're here tonight what we have got is an exhibition process that runs from the 4th or december through to the fifth of march so we can ago CIT 23 full calendar month process so in in many ways we're pleased with that that's exceptional for other le PS at their exhibition it is an extended period so that's a positive but we do recognize that people need to engage and we need to find the best ways to do that hence evenings like tonight and what we're doing going forward the intent is that these presentations together with the powerpoint information is up on up online within 48 hours so both yourselves are clearly well engaged and others that couldn't be here tonight can access the information and engage the process throughout in terms of how we're engaging and we have exhibitions at libraries in consumer Blaxland and spring were just recognizing what's going on in springwood at the mo with the reconstruction activity will have we have a notification postcard that hopefully everybody that actually arrived and that really gives you more information about how to engage and where to engage we have to have your way have you say website talk a bit more about that intersection in this session we got information sessions again tonight's the first two for that we're planning before Christmas will consider given timeliness whether we run some more in February hopefully we'll have some more informed time then and perhaps be able to give more information there's clearly a range of ways to engage with planners and a wealth of information available so I talked about that shortly so again that's just the postcard that's up there and that was distributed to everybody within the local government area so all residential addresses we've also sent it to those people that live outside the LGA says around 5000 have gone outside of property owners within the LGA and we've issued specific blesses to over 200 properties that were in the more directly bushfire affected areas so we understand that clearly it's a very difficult process for those people come around that often and we'd encourage them to engage wherever possible or be acknowledging they have other priorities right now in terms of the have you'll say website it's basically a mine of information it's up and live so if you've not looked yet please do I think the presentations will be clearly identified there as well as youtube channels for presentations like this one it takes you through the whole process to actually I to get involved told you informs you how to meet have an inquiry how to contact planners and then ultimately how to make a submission if that's not working then please use the phone lines available come through to the department and we can take it from there in terms of the fact sheets at the back of the room there are 31 arrayed out and you hopefully you've sinned the fact sheet references coming up on the PowerPoint slides as we've been scrolling through and if you haven't then please check back through the presentation because that's where you cross-reference the points and're europe throughout this process and really are taking people to the information that they want to see we think we've captured everything in the fact sheets if you if you find things missing then please let us know we're very happy to issue further updates or further information throughout the process as we run through it you know we think we've done a good job or a great job but actually we're also aware that we're human and we may have missed a few items for sessions you know are to a structured point it's really about getting some core information out the sort of information you've heard this evening around how we've translated or sought best-fit from our existing Ellie peas into the new draft LEP 2013 they're not intended to be Q&A sessions but there is an opportunity at the end there plenty of planners in the room that consult you if you have any particular issues it's more about getting you familiar with how the instrument works and how to direct you to the right place questions we have a session tomorrow evening in lawson at the move mountains neighborhood center on residential development session next tuesday in the carrington or rural issues and that's up in catoon berg launching that we've got a big role continue that were keen to engage from the Megalon and hopefully from over in the mountain it's an easier location to get to and we're back in lawson for business industrial uses uses on the 19th sets next thursday we're very pleased with ourselves the in terms of getting information out a few organizations have asked for a full copy of the information we're happy to provide it but it costs there's a huge amount of information to get out and I think a full set of the LEP together with background maps is running in excess of 400 dollars we realize that's not accessible to many we also acknowledge that we have variable download speeds across the mountains and so we came up with the option of a USB and that contains all the documentation on it it's ten dollars away but they are also available at the service counters in springwood and katoomba if you're unable to get one this evening in terms of updates as it says at the bottom there the best way is really by the have your say website so we'll be updating information there we have dedicated phone line so the 47 to 35 trouble now will take you straight to a planner as will the 47 805 trouble 9 we have a number of planners on roster and so if you if the first plan is engaged on the phone it will boot to the next one so we've got a team of three or four planners who are servicing that facility we have a drop in room at councils katoomba office at the present service nine till two and that's really just a not booked but just to turn up facility at the present any questions any issues you have please take that opportunity if there are more in depth issues or coming to the fore then maybe we will start booking times later but for the time looking at further drop-in sessions weekly from the new year so we'll be moving the planning team around the local government area to make them available so we'll be using acknowledged centers so whether the community centers or other a council offices to make people available as I said before we have a dedicated inquiries email address so if you're if you're sure you have an inquiry and you're not getting the response you want on the on the phone then please submit it via the inquiries dle p 2013's it's easy on the the click tab harder to remember at BMCC and there will be a Q&A facility that as these things come live and as we consider them to be relevant to all would be populating the Q&A on the happiest a website in terms of making a submission clearly the submissions the the formal process and there is a fact sheet aight cuz it says at the bottom right-hand corner that takes you into the fullness of the process you know this is this is your opportunity to really change to either support or otherwise any of the issues we own terms of councils positioning over over the draft instrument we encourage people to the submission dl EP 2013 email address because it it's a simple way for us to catalog submissions however clearly people can also drop in hand written submissions over the counter or via mail that's about it for me this evening there are as a safe planners in the room if you have issues you wanted to be discussing now otherwise I say thank you and good night and if you're interested we may see you tomorrow evening in lawson for a residential update okay thank you you
Blue Mountain City Council through the mayor and the general manager we've had offers of help from Penrith blacktown all the surrounding councils are offering you'll see crews out in different colored uniforms they are council employees helping with road closures and so forth now as you can well imagine this flow is going to last for a fair while so some of your services we will not be able to provide and maybe you know if you have woke up near my way Monday garbage collection that might not happen if you're not sure ring up Council on for seven eight oh five thousand keep a close eye on councils webpage we are posting as much information as we possibly can on the council's webpage so I'm asking for you to all be patient this is not going to go away very very quickly so if you have an issue there are the ward councillors they are always willing to help the council staff are willing to help so we look forward to getting through this at a reasonable level we have got maintenance've got cruise going up where there are trained dangerous trees and they will remove them or cut them down and so forth we know that a lot of people have lost a lot of houses we will be trying to help them in as many ways as possible we can I'm not sure what the the Mayor was doing but we was talking about today setting up a Meryl fund to help residents so we are aware of what's going on we just asked for everybody's patience and we will try to provide all the services that we can so be kind to the more thank you very much you
Today I went to buy a blip planting trees got plenty of em Aboriginal learning about the environment in more ways than you could imagine and you also rise and shine okay I really want to go back what we're going to learn about today is about Blue Mountain swaps now the reason that the Aboriginal people really liked being in this spot was because of the swamps the swamps are fantastic systems which provide water and the magic substance which really helps provide that water is the peat that's in swamps this little bit of Pete here may have taken as long as five thousand years to get there that acts like a giant sponge in the landscape can sort of see for a long time nothing runs off very good at trapping sediments and pollutants so you can have dirty water coming into the swamp but what comes out is beautiful clear pure water finding bugs it got very sensitive insensitive bugs which need good water quality clean freak and good habitat just of all of them so if you find these sorts of things you a fish and use a pen I can see it today it was dead I lock on the sheet see if you can find anything that looks like a stick better yes that's what is very very sensitive so those bugs wouldn't survive in a creek that was really polluted and degraded as you come for students a lot of cats one that's the most common thing we're finding isn't it yeah he's interesting because they are in haha see it's true there weren't very many bugs in there even though the ones that we did find were pretty sensitive up in the catchment we've got lots of katoomba we've got shops houses roads all that's when it rains is running off into this Creek and making the water quality not as good as it could be if it was just washed for example she would do me fine I like working with all the water get money where a pH measures acidity playwright tap water PH tap water you'll see water and we go creek order which us here's Craig water can you please so electrical conductivity measure salinity okay if someone can read that for you it's one heavily I like that when you are grown in the webroot life I'm gonna do a game called the web of life now with you you've been learning about how we're all connected in some way without the water that comes from the gully we wouldn't have the waterfalls in wentworth falls did you know that the stream starts here there's a spring that starts here but it eventually go all the way down there now without those waterfalls the dwarf mountain pine can't survive I'm going to take water out of this web I'm gonna do that by also tugging on the string now when you feel a tug on the string can you just lightly tug as well thank you does everyone feel that tug so what just happened in one thing in this huge bio diverse system was taken out and it affected us ball after colonization a lot of people were still coming to was became known as the gully and that was here right up to nineteen fifty six when the Catalina racetrack was approved for construction and this is the big race traffic enci going right around this area the gully traditional owners the people that were living here were evicted from this place to make way for the racetrack they bulldoze this racetrack right through the middle of the bush that was here through all the swamp and caused quite a lot of damage to this area what we're doing now is that we formed a cooperative arrangement with the gully traditional owners and we Co manage this place and we're trying to restore it back to its pre cuddly in a race track condition does anyone put a plant in the ground before it's going to plant the plant there lots of people's that's really just a case of putting the plan in the bottom and gently pushing the soil into the side there making sure that it all goes in there and there's not too much of a an air gap around the get an awesome well they're a great age throughout the think about the aboriginal I'm history of the Blue Mountains and what happened to every four people where we are today and how we needed forward so as people are moving through the landscape they came to Australia after us they were pushing our people out of areas so we had to find where we're going to stay permanently so the gully became that place and the pathways are still there where people used to go through the pathways to get to the homes they're still there people who lived here and the children who grew up here still know how people move around the gully and went up to town this some of the descendants are in this room and there were some descendants in one of the other schools but the people who are first here as well what I'm going to show you here is some stone tools now these stone tools there's a lot more they were found in the gully as stone tools proves and helps with oral history doing traditional things right here in the gully feel inside there see how smooth it is and you feed that outside rough yep so this this one is important because it's a portable grinding stone so this would be put in a rock shelter that probably didn't have the right stone there they would have been put there so that each time you come back you need something to sharpen your axe it's there they've just put it up on a Ledge there it is so you can use it again if you see anything like this the best thing is that you leave it where it is take photos of it let someone know what you've found then your parents can let national parks know they can take a GPS of it and they can put it on a register so that everyone knows it's one two three are you dying in the robot robot camera see my face yessiree yeah robot tamiroxie on my fake yessiree yeah everyone go that yes a big freak out that's really I'm running in paparazzi yamete cetera yay we are gonna be detectives between the start and the finish I have hidden 13 things that don't belong in the bush fire what fire laser things that are threatening our biodiversity richards rubbish two plastic bags one pack of the chips then cowl they've left it here and it's still full very nice what plant this is that that our feet here yellow tomato two Tomatoes belong in the Australian bush that tomato at this point is a weed it's a Glasgow what's always a glass jar being in the air pollution hello chef is your fires excellent Oh Marcus the Sun beams onto the glass and the glass goes into a plant and it causes a flyover lots bushfire so some reflect off excellent who had a good time today I really like it I hot wait to come back we know that it's getting more and more difficult and there's more and more electronic learning and so we're really looking for opportunities to kind of connect young people with nature and to have that kind on behalf of Blue Mountain City Council we're just delighted that you were able to participate I have a very good afternoon ice is the place to be
They're a bit like jewels buried in the landscape most people sort of know there's a swamp out there somewhere but these are not places most people want to go penny outing they're full of leeches and in the summertime you're the full of blood sucking flies and they're full of razors edge that cuts your fingers to pieces if you grab it the full of holes you can fall into and full of mucky stuff they're also full of a lot of amazing things which have nowhere else to live when you think about swamps you tend to think of them occurring in low-lying areas but in the Blue Mountains you have hanging swaps which occur on the sides of valleys where natural instinct tells you a swamp shouldn't occur because the water should be draining away quite freely but because of the unique geology of the Blue Mountains they will occur on these Valley science about seven and a half years ago I was walking out in the mount a range bushwalking and suddenly this huge dragonfly can fly and past on the ground in front of me and because I've been involved in threatened species work I knew what it was I'd never seen one before so I sat down on the ground and just you know half a meter away and it just SAT there and I thought I wanted to find out where it came like what swamps they know they're brilliant swamps so I went out there a month later and I found the swamp where I thought maybe that's where it came from huge swamp one of my favorite swamps and I went in there and the place was just there were giant dragonflies emerging everywhere and they never ever been recorded anywhere in the kind of numbers that I saw them in that day so I spent four hours in the swamp watching the mating and egg-laying and found burrows and made observations that people hadn't even made before it was like that's it that's my mission I need to go and find out more about giant dragonflies so I basically spent the summer wandering across the Blue of swamps the distribution of the swamps and get as much information and observations as I could sometimes you'll be walking through and there will be dragonflies flying up I've had them perch on my face and on my arms they're fighting each other there's miles coming up and you know grappling each other in the area in aerial combat but the really interesting thing about them is that the larvae dig burrows quite deep down into the PT soils into the groundwater most of these swamps once you take a core sample you generally find that they're about between two and three meters deep the peat and that's probably taken 15 to 20,000 years to develop it's very important that we preserve that Pete substrate that's a that's really critical so this is a pretty good example in a fairly boggy piece of this swamp soil it's not a lot of really well defined Pete it's very very decomposed sort of muck Pete but you can actually see we're talking about the amount of water that gets sponges that it's actually you know so there's a huge amount of stuff stored in here you know this goes down for you know a couple of meters at least and although it looks like a big piece of boggy muck it's actually full of all sorts of small invertebrates and worms somewhere in here there's crazy spiraling in here giant dragonflies larvae so essentially what you're looking at even they can't see it is like a very large lake or body of water the peat material in the swamp it can actually hold up to ten times its dry weight in water so it holds all that water so that comes in from the surrounding catchment and it can actually hold it within the landscape and then slowly release it down over the water falls into the streams and so they're very important in maintaining steady flows of water in catchments here they'll act like a giant filter within the landscape what comes out the other end is a much higher quality and that feeds then into the into the broader international pi they appear to be quite resilient as long as they're wet fire goes over the top it's like a bit like a haircut this swamp was burnt out five years ago that it had very little damage to the peak because then although it was a bit of a dry time it was there were still quite a lot of moisture in the soil a resilient system can be exposed to change but it can maintain its integrity and function in the face of that change so it's a very important aspect because change is always occurring some change the human-induced some are short-term climatic and then of course we have the threat of long-term climatic change the Blue Mountain swamps listed as a vulnerable endangered ecological community which is in recognition of the rarity and their vulnerability to ongoing threats so if those threats aren't addressed then in the future it's likely that they'll become more and more rare and potentially no longer exists in the landscape by running the particular climate change scenario putting in the dates you want to swamps could potentially shrink too it shows the most vulnerable swamps and it also shows an overall potential for significant loss of the asset across the mountains with that we'd lose not only their hydrological functions which are very important but there's also the community itself the assemblage of species that occur within a Blue Mountain swamp are a unique assemblage of species and they also home to a variety of really important threatened species such as the endangered giant dragon fly there are animals small and large crawling around eating stuff living their lives growing up and they're all depended on groundwater if the water table drops down too far more and stays there for too long those species are going to be threatened this is what is called generalization of the swap it's obviously the water is taking the easiest course and it drains the swamp of water and without water it won't support the same vegetation different species will will occur weeds will invade it and there you have a loss of swamp and there's another channel will walk across another one a lot of the urbanization in the Blue Mountains has formed along the main central ridge line of the Blue Mountains platter and the storm water that's generated from all the hard surfaces the concrete asphalt etc tends to run off to the low-lying areas and into the valleys and it can very easily channelize through swamp systems by potentially making them as robust and in it as natural as state as possible then that's going to give swamps the best chance in the face of climate change the swap care program has resulted in over ten thousand hours of volunteer time being donated over the last five years to protect these swamped systems so I think that just gives you an indication of just how passionate people are about this I think it makes a big difference you can you can see you know you can't_''_466.72 might come back and there's still some weeds there but nothing like what what it was and I'm always amazed at how you know a morning's work just now and again can make such a big could we do in the future to help these systems absorb the impacts of climate change without changing too much themselves and really there are no magic bullets what what's happening now is really the sort of management will have to happen in the future perhaps more so perhaps more people involved because the the vulnerabilities that are here now are also the future vulnerabilities so if we can act to repair the current damage to swamps it just increases their resilience to the predicted impacts of climate change so apart from the times then it's been 35 degrees or down I've been walking in the full Sun and covered in blood even those times that I actually enjoy because I feel like you know you feel like you're you're there you're in the swamp and your present with what the swamp is about so yeah you know I don't_''_538.96 I don't_''_539.41 I've never regretted it yet woof oh drats we got it yeah you can go for a few hours thinking on going very well here I mean some just foot is absolutely saturated
Well it's a pretty tough time uh to be uh talking about education week here we are in the middle of a covered lockdown but what I hear is that all of our students across the mountains are doing an absolutely fantastic job you've got online learning happening I know that you're engaging in the best way you can with your teachers and I know that they're all really proud of you and I'm really proud of our local schools now on the subject of online learning I want to tell you about a few things that we've got happening we've got our e-library here at blue mountain city council and it's always open the library offers free online resources such as e-books e-audio books via our borrow box we've got e magazines we've got rbd virab digital we've got video streaming on bema film we've got manga languages we've got e-resources e-learning games for kids we've got youth and hsc resources but all sorts of fantastic stuff at our e library so go to a this lock down time and join us online we've got a really popular virtual insight program which now includes some fun online creative workshops there's tutorials there's kids programs so look check out these events via via our council website but most importantly just have faith I know this is a tough time and you're away from your family you're away from your friends you're away from you know all that fun and activity you have when you're at school so just have faith we'll get through it and we'll get through it by sticking together and you know use those online resources to keep in touch
Hello I'm dee also known as andy both both things dee and andy um welcome to series two of love local live presented by blue mountain city council and fusion boutique and shelter studios um this is the second series of um five live stream shows that these guys have been putting on throughout this devastatingly interesting year um and the last of which for this season will be running next week as well um yeah I'm I'm absolutely stoked to be here and play some songs for you tonight it's been a long time since I've played to a real audience so that'll be happening soon and in the meantime I'm just gonna sing some songs for you and I hope you enjoy crooked alignment yellow laces strangely familiar faces over underdressed they read the weather wrong secondhand ski jacket matching the fake

so much for tuning in that song is called freezing home um I read it when I was about 16. and you can listen to it again on my spotify if you like it's on my first ep called deciduous I'm going to play another song that's off a different record that I have released this track's called edinburgh and I have actually released it twice uh actually scrapped that three times because three times is a charm people out in that street tonight people who don't want to fight then the lights aren't light outside anymore they told to go behind closed doors they're only dead to keep that cold out they're only dead to keep that cold out smokey local in belief that a stranger would know and respect his seat abandoning it for a cigarette the places in which I decide to maintain my respect is that I know too many men like him went home that come here and they come for the music and the music alone and I know that will be that will be made when I start to feel he's one pint of dark frothy beer sits our sad when compared with two glasses of red wine which place would you rather be which drink would you rather have in your hand which place would your father be which dream would you rather be sinking hmm so I never want to start to feel old I never want to stop feeling bold I never want to start to feel cold when my circulation's getting crappy cause I've started to get old I never want to start to get old I never want to stop feeling bored I never want to start to be told where I can and where I can't what I'm not allowed to do walking through those streets unevenly paved the streets of old town make me roast in my grave I never want to start to feel odd I never want to stop feeling bold I never want to start to be told where I can and where I can't what I'm to feel old I'll never want

they're like dad I want a toy and I you know never come back radio this song is called easier um a really dear friend of mine kalani gakken produced a an amazing music video for this for me um maybe maybe a year ago I think it was and it's very quintessential um blue mountains shots in in totties and the old pirate ship cafe and in the carrington and all around town so if you'd like to check that out you can google it or youtube it just type in easier and andy into youtube or google yeah it would be easier if I hated you but I don't all I really wanna do is call you up on the telephone I've got no real reasons to be angry at you so I guess I just won't be I would say want something want something more more than where it ended I really hate the way that it ended things would be so much easier if I didn't still care for you it would be so much easier if I didn't want to pick easier if I didn't tell you all of my secrets but I did it would be so much easier if I did not have any regrets I really hated the way that it ended ah ah ah I wanted something more I really hated the way that it ended so it would be easier if I hated you but I don't so I guess I'd just so I guess I just um thank you so much for listening if you're just tuning in hello and welcome I'm dee and you're watching a series of music gigs streamed live from northumber this is love live local run by uh blue mountain city council fusion boutique and shelder sheldon shelter studios um it's an absolute pleasure to be here singing to you in this gorgeously decorated room um I'm going to sing some more songs to you yes very good um this next song I'm going to play for you is called one foot in the grave I actually haven't_''_1654.159 played it live in it's the title track of my second it's also my um highest stream track on spotify which is awesome um if you are enjoying my music you can go and follow me on spotify and social media and you can buy my albums on bandcamp as well um which is the best way to do it I said someone said to me like a week ago that you should treat spotify as the radio and band camp as the record store so if you want to listen and search for music use spotify and if you want to um support your artists then buy their album on bandcamp anyway even if you still listen to them on spotify and I think that's a really great approach to have especially in this digital age yeah digital as heck this song's called one foot in the grave one foot in the grave and he don't care not to close his shave for his facial hair one too many times far too many times haye's been kicked while he's been lying down but to to save his soul he's convinced that he's never going to win and I try and I try to convince him otherwise one foot in the grave and he still don't care not too close to shave for his facial hair one too many times far too many times he's been kicked while he's been lying down quite a day and he's still terrified of turning grey he's danced with the devil more times then I can count on my hands he's got one foot in the grave I'm hoping one day that I will make him see that one more kiss might just save his soul his pockets hold tobacco and ventilation his wallet is case my hands when they get cold one foot in he still don't care not too close to shape for his facial hair one too many times too many times he's been kicked while he's been lying down but to him it's just another loss I want more kiss might just save his soul he's convinced and I tried to convince him otherwise one too many times far too many times he's been kicked while he's been lying down he's been kicked while he's been lying down he's been kicked while he's been alive down thank you so much for listening I am going to play a new song for you that I've written this year um

not invested enough you're not invested enough you cannot hold me enough to stay another day another morning I wake up feeling like I've already wasted the day comes up late the day's already wasted

 you oh I'm a trained as a graphic designer I was born in Canberra lived in Sydney most of my life and then three years ago I migrated to the Blue Mountains I loved the bush here in the Blue Mountains and I'm out two or three times a week integrating myself with them with nature but I also love going to Sydney and cities and just immersing myself in the you know the the fast pace of the big cities I hit the wall I mean literally was unable to I had no focus I had no ambition I I just lost my complete way in life and you know by confronting my issues then I you know by dealing with them head-on was the only way we could get out of that home I've had great difficulty in just getting even job interviews and that's been something that's been hard because I I've got a quite a you know extensive background in work incredibly and yet trying to get a job just even for a few days awake the moment in a very dark hole four or five years ago and chose to move from Sydney and sort of addressed the issues that you know prohibiting me some from working with has gone through periods of battling severe depression and anxiety anything visual I love anything like part architecture photography I probably mentioned photography 20 times I love it it's it rules my day I love it I don't think a disability should be a reason not to be included to say for a job interview or for a job I think that everybody should be treated equal and judged on their merit we needed somebody who could assist us to coordinate our major fundraising event and Anthony came with the skills and background that certainly suited that role Casso wellness support has been operating for around eleven years now and we look after the wellness aspect of clients who are undergoing have been diagnosed and undergoing treatment for cancer I have been coordinating every all the artists that have been contributing their creative responses to the brief I could be on the phone one moment I day I don't know that people really take a lot into account a range of disabilities that people may have I have in my previous workplace I worked with people with disability having worked now with Antonia and they're just wonderful they just come in and they're part of the team and we think that we good for them and they're good for us the ones unique and everyone's got some quality that you can add to any business so people and just get those doors open get the interview is happening and you just think positively
 I moved to Australia when I was little boy I was born hearing but became deaf after a virus I'm the only deaf person in my family I think but I really don't have any barriers but I suppose communication is one because I can't use the phone I really don't feel like I have a disability I feel quite know I like to challenge myself I like to have fun I like things that are hard so I found mountain biking was really something that I was interested in it was difficult at first and hard work but I absolutely loved it many different places that I go to I go to Sydney the Central Coast Wollongong Tasmania Canberra I love to travel and meet new people while doing this activity and I absolutely love mountain biking some bosses we'll look I think it's a bit difficult how am I going to communicate like tend to panic I don't know how to start working with myself I explained to them I can do everything the only thing I can I can write on paper so that's the accommodation that they just need to make just me and it helps them to understand the reasonable justment that is needed our joint ability options and this is where I've got introduced to it Johnson who I've now started working with as an accountant and keeper my business it's called exterior bookkeeping services we started around about 18 months ago we have a small team and we provide bookkeeping payroll and bath services for businesses churches not-for-profits both locally and around Australia we had a role that we needed to fill and provide was a great candidate for that role there are challenges but there's also really great solutions to those challenges and it'll be a real shame to lose a fantastic candidate because of our mental barrier that can be easily overcome so there's some really great employees out there willing to work loyal skilled treated like any other recruitment we always have something to offer it's a new experience Auslan definite swear Nassif can do things in the world so it's employers know that we can do the same as what they can even with their disability you
 hello my name's manu I am one of the directors and coordinators of littleton stores co-op and it's beautiful initiative farmweek forward which is a peri urban farming social enterprise today I'm going to show you how to raise seeds and make them turn into beautiful seedlings that we have all around our greenhouse let's get started you can see this is what I use to raise seeds in which is sifted compost so littleton stores co-op is actually the only shop food shop that I know that has absolutely zero food waste and that's because we compost every bit of food waste that comes out of the shop or the kitchen or the community hub and we turn it into beautiful rich compost that we then use to grow more beautiful veggies to put back into the shop so it comes full circle and it's really beautiful that way what I do is I use just a regular old basket like this to sift out the big pieces so you can see those big chunks and that's what makes really healthy chip these big bits are a bit tricky to raise seeds in so you want to sift those out and then what you're left with is this beautiful crumbly mix that you can grow seeds in and your seeds won't have too much trouble coming up and germinating that way so this is my little container of seed raising mix and what I would suggest for you guys at home is to just use whatever you have at home so there's a couple of things you can do you can save these punnets and reuse them just you know put put some new seed raising mix into them you don't have to sterilize them or do anything like that you can just wash them with some with some water and perhaps a little bit of grey water safe liquid if you wanted to but it's really not necessary if you have healthy compost it will get rid of any problems any diseases or anything like that that might have been in the planet another thing you can use which is really really great is these berries come in these are great because you know we're lucky enough to have a greenhouse like this but if you don't have a greenhouse at home these are great little miniature greenhouses that you can grow in look at this so whoop you close it off and it's a beautiful little mini greenhouse that you can use to grow your little seeds in so you can see there's a couple of little wormies still in my compost which is a really good sign by the way you can have them still living in your planet it doesn't matter they'll do a really good job of building organic matter so when you fill your punnets it's really important to tamp them down just to make sure there are no big air holes in your planet again tamp it down just press just tap it down like this to the surface that way you can get any residual big bits out and top it up to the top like this now with seeds a really great rule of thumb is that the size of it needs to go in so if you see these tiny little seeds and I'm putting basil in now this is green basil and look at the size of these seeds they're only tiny and this usually indicates that it's only that width in the soil that you need to sow them small seeds are usually the ones that need a little bit of sunlight to actually germinate properly the larger seeds if you think of a pumpkin seed that's about this this wide that's how deep into the soil you want to be sewing it in order for it to germinate properly okay so they don't need so much sunlight to germinate for these little guys it's a really good idea to put to put the seeds that you need in your left hand and get the seeds to put in your punnets with your right hand now it sounds really silly but it's just so much better than having very little control in trying to do it this way because then you'll get way too many seeds into the it's called thinning thin out the the plants that you don't want really really simple with these tiny little seeds with basil and with tomatoes and capsicums and things like this you only want to put one or two seeds in each in each cell like this two seeds because you want to make sure that you will get good germination so you want to make sure that something will pop up if you put only one seed then you've only got the one chance of that seed being happy and germinating if you put two in then you've got double double the chances of it working out really well okay so here we go I've just made a really tiny indent you can see not very deep in at all and then I just cover very lightly cover these seeds over with your little punnet like this you'd probably want to put little five little indents like this and do the same put two in each little indent and you'll be able to separate it out once they've grown to full ready to pull apart and probably put in your garden and look at what a beautiful little self-contained greenhouse that would make which is really great the next thing we're going to do is water these seeds in so let's water them softly and another super important thing is to label what you've just sewn I know I know you think you're going to remember but I promise you will not I've already labeled this one it says green basil so let's pop it in and I'm using a recycled fork as the label and that's it beautiful you could pop this on your windowsill onto a plate or you could put it in a nice sunny spot because green basil will want sun to germinate and to do well so put it in a sunny spot and then you'll be ready now we've got some little progress here so this is what's so so beautiful about starting from seed is that 10 days later 10 days after you've sown your seeds this is what it looks like they've all you know they're all germinating and showing their beautiful little first leaves now the one thing you've got to watch is when you're dealing with small cells like this if you have two popping up like these two babies here what you want to do is thin one out in order to allow for the other one to grow really well and happy and there's where there's not too much shade created by either one for the other one it is better to allow for one to grow really well and to get enough sun than it is to for two to grow averagely because they're not getting enough sun so that'll set you off on a really great start on your food gardening journey if you want to learn more you can follow littleton stores co-op and farm it forward on facebook and instagram so every thursday we run volunteer sessions with farmit forward and you can come along and pick up any tips and tricks on how to grow your own food from scratch we'd love to see you there you
G'day guys I'm joel I'm the owner and restaurant server monty's here in blackstone in the liberal mountains we've been here for about 32 years and today we're going to be doing for you the pear and prosciutto pizza which is a seasonal pizza and we do it with fresh figs in the summer months and in the winter months we do it with fresh pears so firstly we're going to be making our fresh dough so we're going to be combining our warm water going to be combining little bit of a teaspoon and a half of salt some dried yeast about a teaspoon and our flour so we're going to do is going to knead this by hand this firstly and what we're going to what we're going to aim for basically is a consistency that's smooth and elastic basically and give it a good need and if you find that it's a little bit too wet just add a little bit more flour to it or if it's too dry add a little the beginning basically I'm going to be adding now just a bit of olive oil just a coat in the bowl what we're going to do we're going to cover this a nice sort of dry dry cloth put it away for about an hour and a half and it's in a dry warm area and what you want to see is basically the dough sort of having risen about double sort of basically about double the size of what we have here so I'll put this aside for now so what I've done is I've prepared one earlier so that's pretty much what we're after that's how our finished dough right there so what I'm doing is I'm going to be cutting about 170 180 grams out of that all right so that there is about 170 right there we're going to do is we're going to have bit of fun now we're going to get some create a little bit of mess here prepare your area with some with some flour so we it's not going to be sticking to our rolling pin and also to the bench as well if you've got kids it's always a fun time at home yeah have pizza nights at home and the kids may not make a nice big mess from one end of the kitchen medicine like my daughters do okay guys so we've got our pizza ball ready to go so what we're going to do firstly is we're going to give it a bit of a bit of a flat out with a palm your hands all right don't use your fingers because when you're using too much anyway because if you use your fingers too much that pretty much can create divots in the pizza base and when you're cooking it it creates like spots where it won't cook popping spots so just try and use your palms with rolling your pizzas little tricks to the tray that my father once taught me and I've sort of continued on with that when you're rolling the pizza try not to have the rolling pin straight up and down what you want to try and do guys is get it moving so you create like use your wrists to create a circular motion and that gets the pizza pulling around look at that now that's going to be about enough for our medium size you know because as we throw it up the piece is going to stretch between your two hands you want to give it a bit of a bit of a bash out with the flower stretch it out between your palms a little bit and here's the best part guys up we go that's it and do that again perfect all right so that's what we've got so we've got our pizza base we're going to grab our tray so what you want to do guys is just remember to stretch it out a little bit make sure the tray is pre-oiled the reason why we do pre-oil our trays is so the pizza can stick and it doesn't shrink if there's too much oil on your bases you the dough will pull in it won't stick if there's not enough you can over stretch it basically we're going to be grabbing ourselves a fork or a spoon and create a few aeration holes in our in our dough this is to prevent air pockets or bubbles so when you're cooking the pizza you don't have a like a small bubble or volcano so to speak blow up and pizza ingredients slides off it and the pizza's inconsistent right so let's get to the best part now this is the fun part of the day that's adding our ingredients to this pizza we're going to start with our our macadamia oil all right so we're going to give the pizza just a light film of the macadamia oil all right now you can spread this on with your fingers guys there we go now this has got that beautiful nutty aroma this oil and that combines with the the gorgonzola and the oven roasted walnuts that we're going to do soon it's just perfect so I'm blue cheese gold gonzalo whichever you'd like to use we use a gorgonzola here so this is again this is personal taste you know for this pizza here I mean I'm probably putting a little bit too much here but um I do like my blue cheese on a pizza next we're going to grab some sliced pears we're just using some packing pears here today like thinly sliced ones so probably about some for about half a pair there we go so just evenly space those out try to cover your gorgonzola as well because you're not going to put much mozzarella onto this pizza and whatever's not covered will burn so cover those up so that's fine guys just like that all right next I'm going to grab a bit of mozzarella grab a good handful of the mozzarella and just um always work with two hands my father taught me always work with two hands don't pat that down just let it sit let it fall um it's just better for aeration so you want to be you can don't over cheese it because it's not that sort of pizza it's a it's more of a delicate about balance about flavors here so right so we're just going to finish off adding our bit of mozzarella there now we're going to pop it in the oven I've set this up I've preheated my oven to about 250 300 degrees excellent all right so we're going to let that cook for about probably about four to five minutes or until golden brown just depends on your oven as well like if you're using a conventional or a fan-forced oven as well at home okay so that's what we're looking for guys or after that sort of crispy golden sort of texture there we don't want to do this one's a thinner style pizza this one so that's it that's the pizza right there here we go perfect let's get to finishing this uh beautiful pear and prosciutto pizza off our tray so firstly we're going to grab a nice you could be a little bit liberal or or not depends on personal preference on this one all right so um we've got our rocket on our pizza now what we're going to do now is get ourselves a tray and we're going to basically we're going to oven roast our walnuts and you want to get them slightly golden brown don't burn them you just want to pick up the just so they get the basically the natural oil and flavor coming out of the walnuts right so onto your tray what you do is pop these into the oven over here all right and while they're they're roasting we're going to get our prosciutto onto the pizza this is the best part all right so get your nicely thinly sliced tame palmer or prosciutto medium sized pizza probably about four four to five good sized slices on the pizza next we can probably add our some shea parmesan to the this as well just again just a small handful what you want to do is just um shake that on right let's check our walnuts see how we're going all right let's have a look so that's nice and golden brown there perfect just what we're after all right so let's cool down for a few seconds so what you're going to do is just grab a handful of those just crush them between your fingers all right just to finish off with a bit of garnish we're going to be re-adding just a few slices of hair there and last but not least just a drizzle of macadamia oil okay guys so um that's our finished pizza right there the um the beautiful pear and prosciutto pizza now obviously this can be done quite easily at home this pizza we've adapted it for you guys today in a conventional oven in fanforce southern or even in the weber so I actually did this in a weber about two weeks ago and it turned out fantastic so if not let us do the cooking for you one night pop down here we're here six nights a

We're at war I'm a public school today to conduct what we call a bi blip getting out into the bush connecting with nature and learning about what's in our backyard and where the water goes when it goes into the bush and beyond the big thing today with the kids is to get them out in the bush and do some learning in the bush that's rich and meaningful to them they're identifying different water bugs they're looking at leaf litter and looking at all the kinds of things they can find really they're opening their eyes and their ears and really tuning in to what the bush is all about so listening for what they can hear touching smelling doing charcoal rubbings drawing things with their pencils and just letting that magic of the bush sink into their hearts that was a banks here okay when we set up their programs we talk we work with the teachers to look at where it fits in with the curriculum of course and what the needs of the schools and the priorities of bush on a tree they look like a slugs and trail the fact that the council organized this day has been amazing they've provided resources for us so we didn't have to pay they've come out they've provided the activities for us which is amazing because they have access to so much that we don't have access to it really gives us a really solid foundation that we can really build on when we go back into the classrooms we'll be back down here again and the kids will really know what they're looking for for the council to have done this and provided it for us has been a godsend I think I'm very happy that I ever bushel in nice cool backyard and in my own god you
 hi my name is Leah Blaney I'm a former Mathilda for my winter force warrior and current head coach of our u-20 national team I'll be bringing to you a series of ball mastery skills for you to do at home each set we're looking at you to complete three times at 30 seconds per set please make sure that you put press pause in between so that you have 30 seconds recovery before starting the next set okay next activity in our advanced ball mastery skills we're going to look at toe touches through the codes okay and then going to look to play a pass you might have a teammate at home that you can or a sibling that you can use for this or at worse there's a ball wall there's lots of good things that you can use in replace of of plays if you don't have access to that all I'm going to do is I'm going to dribble with good control into the cones back to our my toe taps notice ball between my of the cones nice and sharp my heads up when I come out of the cones I'm gonna play a pass in reverse so my body side on so I can receive it and take my first touch forward very very important in this that I'm going to dribble away play the next person in line and Meghan will take off top speed good toe taps between nice and sharp good notice her heads up good athletic position playing a pass reverse she's side on she can take her first touch forward and Olivia will go making follow Olivia quick feet nice and sharp go ahead Molly's on her toes to receive the pass good if I was a defender in here Olivia takes her first touch forward and beyond to beat me good nice and quick head up head up excellent play pass good I mean here is a defender first touch forward and beyond that defender quick feet quick feet quick feet go Olivia good I'm in here first such forward and Beyond and relax there okay next skill in our advanced ball again after you finish through the cones I'd like you to play a pass to your team or sibling you might have at home to help you work on this skills if you don't have that there's always a wall you can use okay you're gonna receive the ball back take a good first touch forward and be on the defender to complete the action Megan let's go good notice all taps on top of the ball using her studs arms and legs working together excellent play the past open up first touch forward and beyond with a left foot this time important we always work both sides left foot right foot good take a touch forward it's good Molly's gonna take a first step forward and beyond a defender in here good control when we're receiving the ball good on top of the ball top of the box nice and sharp so notice lots of good little touches on the ball good Molly can you face me the entire time now is a little progression to this move the ball through you face me the entire time Slynt lots of touches on the ball good body shape side on to receive and play forward good open up receive and relax there okay next activity in our ball mastery series a little stop where again you're looking to keep the ball between your feet good control in here moving from doing the skill slowly to at maximal speed big and clever look at what see what this looks like okay little start stop good notice good knees bent good athletic position keeping the ball between her feet slightly different to a toe tap okay there's a definite stop so it's a start stop you're moving the ball in between your feet with good control if you can keep the ball in between your feet it gives you an advantage versus a defender because if it's on one side it's more likely the defender is going to know which way you're going to go between your feet gives you the opportunity to go either good excellent can we increase the speed now we're comfortable girls the uncomfortable increase speed increased pressure in a session good nice and sharp good head up Molly excellent arms in good athletic position for balance and relaxed there okay so our next activity in our advanced for mastery skills it's going to involve movement to receive I'm then going to dribble looking to beat an opponent and work on my first touch and again my creativity with a finish or a pass into a medium goal again if you need things at home that to replicate the goals you can use a target against a wall a bib whatever it might be if you don't have access to some of this equipment okay so again I'm gonna start nice and easy on my toes I have a partner officer who's going to take a good first touch out of her feet I'm gonna move to receive the ball notice I checked my shoulder behind me before I received it I'm then going to dribble into these currents any actions I like nice and creative between the feet cut when I'm ready to sides take a good first touch and then pass the ball nice and easy and the mini go have a look at what this looks like a little bit quicker let's go good any action you like is creative as you like in these cones so then and finish big and rotate around with Olivia Olivia come up here after you play this pass good notice both players have used all surfaces of the foot different dribbling and first touch techniques and a nice little finishing the mini goal good nice and quick so when she's ready to exit and finish in the meet him okay let's speed this up now good can you get through a top speed good nice and sharp I like it I want you to be brave in there try moose you haven't tried before does speed go make sure you're on your toes ready to receive the ball for the next person in line come towards the ball when you're ready Megan good exploding again you're cutting the ball you're dragging it you're using the looked at in previous sets with the finish the girls are locking their ankles they're using the inside of the foot to pass the ball into the goal nice and composed good god speed quick and out quick get out good can you use as many surfaces as possible outside of the foot inside of the foot studs and relax it's been a pleasure showing you these skills today I look forward to seeing you down the local park
Hi my name is Mark Green Hill and I'm mayor of the city of Blue Mountain our Blue Mountain City Council is proud to continue its support for yellow ribbon National Road Safety Week this is a commendable initiative of the Sarah safer Australian roads and highways group this year's theme drives so others survive reminds us all that we have a shared responsibility on our roads the need for safer roads exists across Australia but is particularly important to the Blue Mountains community we use a major highway at the local road on a daily basis and speeding is one of the leading causes of road crashes we all need to remember to slow down so I urge you drive as if your loved ones are on the road ahead and show you're a road safety supporter by displaying a yellow ribbon on your vehicle or wearing a yellow lapel ribbon through National Road Safety Week you can also show your support by using hashtag Drive SOS on social media thanks very much for listening
Hey hope you don't mind us texting you out of the blue but now that the smoke is cleared and green shoots appear and we can all head back outside we would love all our friends to come back take a road trip enjoy our special sunset and stay over experience what it's really like up here in the blue go blue stay a night or two you
Then began migrating outwards 130,000 years years ago the federal government has released concept artwork for the new Western Sydney Airport terminal but residents will have to wait to see draft flight paths while work is charging ahead at the side the flight paths are not expected to be made public until at least 2021 Blue Mountains meg mark Green Hill joins us now Marc Greenhill welcome so these concept plans are pretty schmick about how do you feel about the release of these now well I'm concerned about the flight paths that seem to be in witness protection they were released a few years ago to a hue and cry great backlash and disappeared and haven't_''_40.02 been seen since but rumors of their existence around it's kind of like an episode of utopia we have the airport with no flight paths it's the S Minister episode the hospital with no patients it would be funny if it wasn't so disrespectful at the end of the day the community I represent is going to be impacted 24 hours a day seven days a week and what have you previously been told about these flight paths previously we were shown flight paths a few years ago that had a merge point over the Blue Mountains town of Blaxland so just a few thousand feet up well whatever it is a merge point it's where all of the flight paths come into one point and then head down the hill towards the airport now the government said that that was withdrawn there'd been a merge point over Blackson but we haven't seen the flight path since so while except that there may not be any merge point over Blaxland it's hard to see with the airspace architecture for Richmond and bankstown Kingsford Smith how the planes won't be funneled over the Blue Mountains we just want to know yeah isn't it pretty obvious from where the airport is what the flight paths are going to be yeah you have to look where the airport is but also where other airports are and where their airplanes fly so their airspace architecture and the spaces in between are obviously the areas where the about this process so far well I think it's farcical and I think it's disrespectful we have the Visitor Information Center on a construction site that's where you'd want to go if you're visiting Sydney we have now the schmick designs for terminal but we don't have the one thing the community wants to know and that's the flight paths you know back in the early 2000s I was involved in the campaign in the airport wasn't proceeded with and one of the reasons was that the community rose up when they saw those flight paths I can't help thinking it's a little bit advantageous to the government that the flight paths won't be released until it's almost all too late and that's my concern so for people who aren't familiar with the Blue Mountains in Sydney give people an idea of what what the Blue Mountains is what why people are attracted to live there and why you're concerned about what could happen the Blue Mounds is a world heritage area that was listed as five million tourists come visit each year it's the home of many rare endangered species it's a it's a wonderland to to visit the the the environment there is very fragile the visitors come for the peace and the tranquility and the concern we've got is that there's an economic impact from you know losing that peace and tranquility that thing that attracts people to the Blue Mountains were also concerned that the impact on our residents and the impact on a natural environment our residents said more than a thousand meters a thousand feet I should say above sea level so many planes that come in will impact us greater because we're higher the government I guess would argue that there is a positive economic impact with the business that this Airport this significant Airport is going to bring into the region yeah I think personally I think that the the evidence of that has fluctuated we've been told different stories about how many jobs will be created and where they'll come from there's no guarantee those jobs will day what the community of the Blue Mountains wants to know is how will they be impacted similarly communities in Western Sydney and no one knows where the planes will fly no one knows how low how often and how much their quality of life will be diminished that's just unknown and so do you really think that you're going to be able to stop planes flying over the bloom at like this Airport is going headed like they're building started it's close to the Blue Mountains do you really think that with some community enthusiasm that you will be able to prevent planes flying over the Blue Mountains at at a level which is disruptive well I wonder if the government thinks that and I wonder if that's why we haven't seen the flight paths I remember what happened in the year 2000 and beyond I was president of the regional Organization of councils back then it was community action that stopped it then but even if you're of the view that that that's not going to happen that they're at least people should know where the planes are going to fly so that they can have a say so they can speak out I'm against the airport I don't think it should be there but I'm really offended when the community I represent is being given shiny terminals and Visitor Information centers everything but what they really want to know and that is how much will my quality of life be diminished do you expect those flight paths have been settled on now and the government's just not releasing them look I I I don't believe people are being dishonest what I believe is that the government could settle flight paths and could release them because they did a few years ago it's it's inexplicable that they could do it in 2015 but they can't_``_324.32 do it in 2019 I think it should be an emphasis for the government they've given us a timetable they've said 2021 make it sooner if they knew what the flight paths were in 2015 they can generate flight paths now they know where planes fly they know where the Richmond Draft fly they know the spaces in between this is not hard and Mark Grendel just why we've got you here the Blue Mounds was ravaged by bush fires ten years or so how many years ago 2013 yeah terrible bush fires up there that had through that year of that period we're coming in to a really dry summer now what are conditions like there up in the Blue Mountains and how are people up there feeling about the the prospects for the season ahead yeah I was mayor at the time and it was a period that I'll never forget a lot of people were deeply impacted by that and are still recovering the bush is very dry the conditions are not good we are on high alert what I say to Blue Mountains residents wherever I go is have a bush by a safety plan ready know what you're going to do when and if this happens so that you can put that plan in action immediately and not be caught short that's the big I hope we don't see it ever again but the community needs to make sure it's ready there was something there was something like 200 homes that were lost up that way in 2013 I've have most of those people rebuilt or bought what's the progress a large number of people never came back and a large number did I spoke to a resident just the other day who said I'm back on my block I mean I mean a home but it's not my home it's not the home I had so I'm in my block I'm on my property in a different house and there's a sense of dislocation around that everyone's recovery is different some people have resettled well others of resettle well but we'll never forget the terror of that day and some have never come back it's got to be seen to be believed and we look at the terrible events elsewhere in the state and then we think about the Blue Mountains 200 houses in an afternoon it was an incredible I will never forget yeah and yeah well good luck with this season ahead hopefully I know no terrible boys is up there this year my friend all thanks so much for a big couch out to us thank you now 40 elderly residents are searching for a new home as a
 hi my name is Leah blini I'm a former Matilde for my winter forest warrior and current head coach of our u-20 national team I'll be bringing to you a series of for mastery skills for you to do at home each set we're looking at you to complete three times at 30 seconds per set please make sure that you put press pause in between so that you have 30 seconds recovery before starting the next set so the first couple activity is going to look at today I working on our ball mastery skills okay our first touch at a basic or beginner sort of level what I'm going to ask you to do is have the ball between your feet start nice and low bend your knees okay and you're going to look to keep the ball with good control between your feet here so I'm going to touch it with my right foot over to my left left to right and get going good so just keep it between your feet excellent head up facing me if you can you get comfortable can you go a little bit quicker for me please speed it up it up make sure you can see what's around you be aware can you move forwards for me now please keep that good control keep that ball between your feet knees nice and bent and I sit alone can you move backwards to the left good head up head up be aware to the right and relax there okay next ball mastery activity for our big it is it will be salt ups okay so I'm going to ask you play place one foot on top of the ball with your studs and then you're just going to alternate between right foot left foot on top of the ball using your arms court and with your leads at the same time so start up nice and slow just touch the top of the ball nice and easy let's go get head up make sure you can see what's around you arms and legs together good coordination get all these activities focused on your ball mastery and developing that first now we're more comfortable arms working with our legs so we're nice and coordinated can you move forwards for me again taking lots of small touches moving backwards can we go to the left to the right and relax there little challenge I'm going to ask you to do as many as you can within 10 seconds are you ready 3 2 1 go squeegee cat good control nice and sharp go to Livia good Molly 5 4 3 2 1 and relax it so it's important that we increase the skill of the activity as we become more comfortable next activity for our basic for mastery skills will be salt taps on top of the ball so we're going to ask us place one foot on top of the ball as your starting position for me please thank you again I'm nice and low I'm in a good athletic position ok I'm just going to alternate feet using my studs on top of the ball try and get as many touches on the ball as I can with good coordination so legs together can you get us beginning this for me at the same time please notice have my head up good coordination just keeping the ball in front of me slightly moving it slip can you go a little bit quicker once you feel comfortable you'd remember head up know what's around you can you move backwards for me please getting good coordination focus move forwards backwards can you move to the left can you move to the right and stop there ok so once you can become comfortable of this we obviously want to increase the intensity and the level that you're working at so I'm going to ask you engage it a little challenge right now you're going to go for 10 seconds and we're going to see who can get the most touches on the ball with good control in 10 seconds are you ready 3 2 1 go good nice and quick arms and legs together good control head up and relax their next activity in our basic ball mastery skills will be cutting the ball with both feet okay foot only you're going to push the ball with the outside of your foot and then bring it back inside using the inside okay so I'm going to go outside inside outside inside really important that you keep the ball close to your body in a good area where if a defender was to come the balls close you can drag it pull it cut it and escape pressure okay so it's outside inside outside inside notice my other foot okay the distance between my right foot and my left foot there's lots of space for me to move the ball can you guys try this for me please inside outside inside good good can you turn and go back with your left for me please lots of little touches we're always working both feet turn come towards me again nice little cuts you want to do lots of little cuts nice and sharp turn and go back with your left inside outside inside outside good and relax there okay so a progression to our cutting is now using both feet so you're going low push the ball outside with my right foot cut it inside with the same foot notice the balls moved across my body outside with my left cut inside with my left and it's constant so here here just on the spot to begin with nice little action again I'm faking to cross I'm faking to shoot using my whole body excellent once you're a bit more comfortable can we go a little bit quicker moving forward and can you turn for me and go back the other way the same action good space between your feet you don't want to be crowded okay next action we're going to look at doing in our beginners ball mastery skills will be looking to lose at the fender by cutting the ball with the outside and the inside of your foot so what I'm going to ask for you girls is to start on your toes okay you're going to dribble when on my command to the end of your grid and then you and cut the ball with the outside of your to pass cross whatever it might be use your whole body to sell the move and then escape into another area of the field at speed so again just quick demo by me I'm going to be here I push the ball out using the outside of my foot to cut the ball notice I reach for it I'm low okay this foot I'm gonna use to push off and take the ball on the dribble in my stride a little bit quicker what that looks like so I'm here notice I'm reaching really cutting the ball left foot and I'm taking off to the end of my grid hey can I have a look at what that looks like please Olivia I'm really faking to cross or shoot excellent good notice your plantar foot there's a good distance between that and the one doing the move good reach and then now I want you to accelerate away after you do the move let's go a little bit quicker outside and then accelerate away good you can come out outside the the end of our lane accelerate away outside and accelerate a little bit quicker outside and then accelerate away good you can come out outside the foot cut accelerate away make sure where we're operating to the end of our lane accelerate away outside and accelerate first few steps are important after you've done the move because you're looking to lose your defender and accelerate away good and relaxed there okay so the next activity we're going to work on in our basic ball mastery skills is the scissor move now I'm going to set you a little challenge at home for you to do with a partner okay the idea is how many scissors can you achieve before the ball either stops or there's a certain point I'm gonna start nice and low on my toes because I'm always ready and in a good athletic position to react okay when my partner's ready she's going to play a nice weighted pass in between my legs and then I'm gonna obviously attempt to try and get as many scissors start nice and low when we're Molly's ready she's gonna play me a pass take off one two three four five six seven eight before the ball stopped I'm gonna play the ball into molly molly will step in front now I'll come behind Molly's in a good position she's got to try and beat my score on your toes Molly go good nice and low let's go nice and quick good turn give me gonna go well done it's been a pleasure showing you these skills today I look forward to seeing you down the local park you
Stop the liquor from flowing into a nearby Creek which flows into the Kentucky River Jim Beam spokesman says the fire isn't expected to affect retail sales the New South Wales government's plan to raise the height of the war again bar dam will be formally scrutinized by the World Heritage Committee which is worried about its environmental impacts on the Blue Mountains the committee is concerned the raised dam would increase the extent and frequency of flooding in the world heritage-listed area is the mayor of the Blue Mountains mark green till hi mark thanks for coming in so what's your response the idea of the dam being raised it's an insane proposition basically we're talking about flooding parts of the iconic Connick Blue Mountains when there are other options available even as far back as the 1990s the then New South Wales government looked at spillway options which would prevent the flooding of world heritage area to give you an example of what we're talking about up the back of Wentworth Falls is a beautiful valley called Kadamba I defy anyone to be inundated during times of flood this is a serious erosion of a very precious part of Australia so people won't necessarily lose their homes your concerns are more for the effects on tourism yeah I think if people are worried about developing the floodplain don't develop there and I think the other thing is the government could invest in flood mitigation downstream the the simple solution as it seems is to flood a World Heritage Area no one's talking about the fact that the iconic Blue Mountains will be flooded when there are other options available to the government what are the costs of those other options though compared to racing height of the dam well I'm not sure it's it's impossible to cost what's lost when a World Heritage Area was lost if five million people visit the Blue Mountains every year many come because it's a world heritage area there are about 42 species at risk here and Aboriginal sacred sites in numerous will be lost done if this proposal goes ahead it's impossible to cost what's is arguing that the dam wall must be raised to reduce the risk of catastrophic flooding as they described it in the Hawkesbury Nepean River plain what's your response interesting their site must be raised on the one hand in they say we're considering the is on the other but again I think that this was looked at by the New South Wales government in the 1990s there are there are other options a spillway was one option where water flow could be managed properly I don't think the government's looking deeply enough at options that would preserve the world heritage area of the Blue Mountains so if the World Heritage Committee says no the dam Dan'l can't_''_157.439 be raised is that legally binding or do you suspect the government might find ways around it what would happen then is that the when you get World Heritage listing you undertake to preserve the values of the area that's listed so if the UNESCO and and the committee itself was to say this shouldn't happen and it were to go ahead then World the committee will knock this back or not look I think the committee having already said that the world huge values will be compromised is likely in my opinion to go against it we call on the the national government the Australian government to intervene what green health thank you thank you us streaming giant Netflix has signed a deal to take over much of the world phone
So I often come down here in my wheelchair because I don't live far from here but if I were to come down here and this is the only real accessible entrance there's no footpaths for me to travel on so I'm on the road all the time which is unsafe some of us have got side entry ramps so your hubs I'll Park here and someone will park next to me and then I'm unable to access to get in and out of my vehicle so it's really important to have those accessible parking spaces that's quite a dodgy conic gradient I can get a little bit bogged with front-wheel drive wheelchair like if it's sleep free that can be really hard to get up so if my son's playing up on that play equipment or playing up on this equipment unless I've got somebody a strong person with me to help push me up this is kind of as close as I can get I actually got stuck in that playground unfortunately I had quite a few of me out I actually know one of their mums came along and I've got safe got rescued no way I'd get my wheelchair over that hump I'd end up bottoming out and teeter-tottering and that goes all the way up with potential bonding and I'd probably get 20 meters along there and then that would be about it it's already cracking and kind of dying even for pedestrians this gets really slippery there's nowhere but this is another access point so when these gates are closed it's a challenge to get a wheelchair this size and it would be a challenge to get a pram in through there as well cars park here on the side of the street that'd be nowhere for someone needing accessible parking really there's really no accessible parking down here and this would be I'm going to presume the main parking spot for for the pool so this is the main footpath pedestrian and I can say wait for me Hamish has he fronts off down to the pool but this is the access's really apart from going off-road here this is from this end of the park this is the only way of getting to the point love coming here and I am here all the time and it's got so much potential to to be even more beautiful I think you know this ugliness that's been created from traffic that's one aspect of it that the accessibility aspect is a big one
Hi I'm mark Greene Hill mayor of the Blue Mountain City Council it's important that you're aware of the proposed Western Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek the tree-lined street behind me is typical of the quiet character-filled towns and villages of the Blue Mountains it's where we live work and play and it's under threat the Australian Government released a draft environmental impact statement or EIS for the airport in mid-october the draft EIS is supposed to look at potential impacts on the community and the environment the problem is it doesn't the IES is a rush job done in just eight months the first took more than two years it only looks at the first five years of operation for the airport but the number of flights similar at that point to Townsville Airport however when a second runway is built and passenger numbers peak in years to come we'll be dealing with something more like Dubai Airport currently the merge point of arrivals is directly over Blaxland no alternative flight paths have been considered in any detail the aeroplanes will be Park 24 hours a day seven days a week with no curfew noise pollution air pollution human health and our precious wilderness and tourism economy were all glossed over how do we know this Blue Mountain City Council has reviewed the draft EIS in considerable detail further 11 Western Sydney councils including ours join forces to Commission an independent review of the draft EIS so we could better understand what it means for our community and environment what to be find that the draft EIS is grossly inadequate it's not good enough and quite frankly the Blue Mountains and Western Sydney deserve better while council is opposed to any Airport at Badgerys Creek we are doing everything possible to get a fair go for the Blue Mountains I urge my community to be informed and have your say we've only got until Friday December 18 to make a submission on the draft EIS make your views known before it's too late you can make a difference visit w-w-w clear blue sky dot info for a summary of the key issues and how you can make a submission thanks for listening
For the purposes of the video tonight we're going to curtail the front and the back end of the presentations and because he's been extensively covered in the three workshops we had today so we've had workshops already on environment heritage on residential and auroral matters and all of those are available online the overall approach we focus this evening in on the core elements so the actual zoning and land use the development controls the strategic tourism and recreation studies and the employment land study so we'll be focusing on the background and the zoning that we've arrived at I should say from the outset actually as a point of order that council acknowledges we meeting tonight on the traditional lands of the Daragon gun don't go our people and we pay our respects to their elders past and present in terms of the background again just really briefly this is an information session and there are ample opportunities to engage council council planners and we'd encourage you to use those opportunities through to the 5th of March and there'll be the context hopefully you're aware that we have three existing le PS when we when LEP 2005 was finally adopted the intent was that we'd have a single LEP across the whole of local government area that accorded with those provisions the standard instrument order changed that framing and we're now as of July 2012 working on a standard instrument LEP and that's basically what's in front of you today in terms of the approach an overview we adopted four key principles the first is that with the opportunity of having a single LEP for the whole local government area we've have a the opportunity of a consistent planning framework we have three separate planning frameworks to primarily and one that largely fits over the business industrial areas however clearly tourism impacts upon l ep91 the rule rural areas as well we will be using the standard instrument LEP format where possible and that's really our guiding principle we're using best fit so our tasking is to keep the current provisions of LEP 2005 principally going forward and we will introduce new provisions which were matters of significance none of them actually impact directly upon the business and industrial agenda so I'll just skip through these now they are covered elsewhere this slide really just shows you what a standard issue looks like so the the seven parts and this is consistent across the whole state so any local environmental plan across the state you'll see the same framework in terms of general issues two notes in terms of a standard instrument we end up with the same land use definitions across the state so they are standardized and we have a single land use table and we've chosen to adopt allows us matrix you'll see that an attachment 3 to the LEP that's hopefully a point of clarification particularly for business and employers in see exactly what's what's permitted and what's prohibited and we have equivalent zones for all current Blue Mountain zones from Standish we're quite comfortable with the zoning that we've landed on the the draft LEP 2013 is a mix of compulsory optional and local clauses and you is just a snapshot out of the LEP the the black text is mandated and we can't amend that so when you're looking at your copy you can see that this stuff that we can't edit the red is settled clauses that have been settled elsewhere across the state and we're adopting to utilize those comments on those are welcome and the green is our local provisions so again more comment on those and those are things we can actively consider this table just shows a zonal equivalence and within LEP 91 we had 12 zones LEP 5 we had 14 zones the sandwich provides 35 to choose from we're opting to use 717 and one extra which is a residential zone really which a course to the character of the local government area really fits our existing residential provision so we're trying to carry that provision across and we're seeking support for that on our lobbying of the department I'll move over to Michelle now who will take you through the business and industrial zones and land uses okay so moving go with them in our business and industrial areas as Annie said earlier we've got an equivalence within the draft instrument building on the standard instrument zones that are available so this is just a snapshot out of fact sheet 12 which gives that equivalence so you can see under our existing Ellie peas in terms of LEP 2005 our employment general is moving towards iron one general industry an employment enterprise in LEP 2005 which is pretty much which is equivalent to light industrial under LEP 1991 we're calling iron to light industry we have got a fact sheet 12 as I mentioned there and this provides quite a bit of information about the approach the template and the overall aims of the the zones what I'll just quickly move on to here is land use definitions now these are as defined in the in the dictionary at the end of the LEP there now uniform throughout nears over Wales because we are coming off the standard instrument and they're consistent with many of the state environmental planning policies that exist above our local environmental the zoning table will determine whether it's permissible without consent permitted with consent or if it's prohibited and I'll just put up a snapshot here this is in our zone I into light industrial which is equivalent to employment Enterprise in 05 and light industry in Le Pen 1991 now to give an idea as Andy already mentioned what's black is mandated by the state what's green we've put in ourselves and what's red is uses that we've put in there so you can see in this zone things like in light industry light industries is permitted with consent so obviously there's a range of other users in there that we've added in and this is able to be looked at by people it's not this is um all of this information is available in the fact sheet as well in terms of our existing land use definitions obviously we've got three principal Ellie peas and sometimes the land uses in those aren't necessarily the same they're often quite specific to the Blue Mountains and for't necessarily have found in any other leeps across the state and our definitions as they stood were unrelated and they've pretty much stood alone if you looked at that you knew that was the use and if you went and you looked at the land use table you'd know where it was with the proposed draft instrument land use definitions the now statewide they're coming out of that standard instrument and there's an approach taken in this instrument to group terms together and that obviously has implications for how you read the land use signs this is a snapshot you're not meant to hook the drill down into it this is attachment 3 to the planning proposal and just a reminder that the the plant the PowerPoint presentation of this will be available for download as well so you can certainly have a look at this later at your leisure and this is pretty much just showing down the left-hand side you can see users such as agriculture and then underneath you've got agriculture extensive agriculture beekeeping and so forth the very top bit more and it's the group terms that I looked at pretty much alphabetically throughout this thing as well and this land use matrix which is very similar to the matrixes within LEP 2005 and 91 will tell you whether it's with consent or development without consent or prohibited to briefly touch on group terms this is an illustration that pretty much shows your group term which is in pink is often or can be called a parent term underneath that can be subsets a child term and within those subsets you can actually find further land use definitions further terms grandchild and that a group term includes all those subsets and that a subset also includes all the ones that sit underneath and an example here is air transport facility has got two uses that sit underneath it airport and heliport and will just briefly talk about how it sits within the land use table but if you wanted to approve both of those you would just put air transport facility but if you went looking for an airport you'd be going perhaps where is it and where they fit now just put up a couple of shots here that should be of interest to people in our business and industrial areas tourists and visitor combination has a variety of subsets underneath it now as I said if choice and visitor accommodation is seen as they used to be permitted with the consent in a zone you'll just see that term and that picks up all those other uses but if we wanted to really only let safe as an example approve hotel or motel accommodation we just list that term none of the other terms would be picked up along with it we could list perhaps a couple of the others but you only use the group term if you want everything that sits underneath that to be approved in that position in the land use table now underneath there are some land use terms that time stand alone within the LEP so it really is a case of getting familiar with your own definitions and realizing that you really need to pay attention to how they sit with regards to one another now premises underneath the standard instrument and I stress this is the standard instrument instrument approach and I won't go into this in a lot of detail but you can see their commercial premises covers a whole range of uses so if you see commercial premises as an approved use or permitted with consent then all those uses that sitting under that I picked up and obviously I've zeroed in there on retail premises which has all those other uses underneath it and once again if we were a comfortable with all of those users being approved you to put down retail premises and perhaps not include business or office so it can be a little bit complex there is information available to try and explain this bit further but really it's a question of just being a bit more familiar and certainly it's our business and our commercial and our industrial land uses that often have the most complexity in this area in terms of our land use definitions we found that when we began to look at moving our instruments across into the standard instrument an equivalent land use within the draft instrument there are some new land uses from the standard estimate that we haven't had in the LGA before and you know on the converse there are some that we currently have which we aren't able to bring forward into the standard instrument and there are also land uses that people have been used to seeing in our le PS but you won't see them there because they're actually controlled underneath other planning legislation such as state environmental planning policy infrastructure or affordable housing so once again there's a you layers of complexity to how these standard instruments are to be read this is just a snapshot and I might go into it a lot of detail this is at the end of fact sheet 12 so there we do a comparison between what can currently occur permitted without consent permitted with consent and prohibited in our existing LEP 2005 or 91 zones and then we've said what that equivalent zone in the in the new draft will permit now bear in mind we've identified or consent prohibited we've noted where there a mandatory term in the new draft instrument and also we've taken the opportunity to where we can identify new uses but just bear in mind that that group term terminology can be come into play here and you might immediately go and say my use here no longer appears there you need to see where it sits within the group term it might still be there it's just not mentioned specifically now I think I might hand over to came to talk about development controls thanks Michelle I'm going to take you through some of the development controls around business and industrial areas so you've heard about the zones and the land uses from Michelle and basically what's permissible and where and I'll just go to the next slide so under LEP 2005 a lot of the other controls development controls are in the locality management provisions or in the precinct controls so currently they sit in schedule 1 of LEP 2005 and also scheduled three for employment lands under the draft LEP it's quite still have precinct objectives they are listed in the LEP the new LEP the draft however a lot of the controls thats it currently within those the schedules or within the precincts are now being moved to the DCP so for example there you can see that we still the precinct objectives are listed there and so they are under LEP to 2005 and they're also within part 7 of the draft LEP with building height building setback site coverage and development density these combined together to form a building envelope and some of that is retained within the draft LEP within part 4 but some of it is moving to the DCP so it has become I guess quite a bit more simplified in terms of the controls that are under the LEP also in terms of design considerations such as landscaping built form and finishes there is a clause within the draft LEP that deals somewhat with that but in the main they're also moving to the development control plan and the same with amenity and safety and car parking significantly is moving to the DCP lot of the precincts or all of the precincts had a provision around car parking and also there's a clause under LEP 2005 calls 99 that deals with parking that's now moving to the DCP and then there's something listed as other there there were precincts that had a number of site-specific controls I suppose you could say or area specific that were very particular to we may have identified particular set back to a street or a requirement around a set back to a public space area or pedestrian access things like that that's also moved to the DCP those provisions so there is I guess more flexibility in terms of the way development controls are organized and it has simplified the process so that's an example there I'm going to go into floor space ratio and building height in more detail but that's an example I guess of how the provisions work together so in the building envelope box that you can see there there's obviously the setbacks and then building height and then the the site coverage which is diagram on the right hand side there you can see that that's I guess a simplified version of the way floor space ratio works so it deals with gross floor area and it can either be spread across the site or as you can see on the far right there if you have two stories then the spread across the site is less but it increases the height and then increases the floor space ratio but I'll go into that in a bit more detail so in terms of the height of buildings that is in the draft LEP and there are a couple of differences in the definition of height of buildings compared to the current LEP one of those is that the current height provision has a height at eve's that's no longer within the standard instrument so that provides some flexibility to building form and there is no longer a requirement to have a particular height at eve's and then an overall height that's been removed similarly the way that the height of buildings is calculated currently under 2005 the measurement draft LEP under the standard instrument definition it's taken from existing ground level so that once again provides a little bit more flexibility in terms of height calculation and also the provision generally heart of buildings is addressed in detail in fact sheet 23 there which you can get at the back of the room and you can also get it on line that goes through how Heights are calculated why the provision exists so it's quite good to get more information there if you are interested in that that's just a close-up snapshot of what's on the fact sheet and that looks at how height is calculated and particularly in relation to sloping sites at figure 2 there at the bottom of the page the other part about the standard instrument is that the provisions are mapped so this is how convention why is all of the maps appear and that is a standard that's prescribed by the department so there's a legend at the left-hand side there and that lists all of the building heights and they're also having either a limit there so if you go anywhere in the state those colors are the same so the bright blue there is five point five meters or for example em I'm not sure if you can see the letter there but one of those yellow colors is 12 meters and that exists the same across the state so we have to map all of the building heights and the clause within the LEP refers to this map so if you're looking for the height limit on a particular lot you would go to the map to find that that's a bit of version there that's the close up there of the legend so you can see the height limits there the letter next to them and they're colored accordingly on the map so in terms of floor space ratio similarly you can get more information from fact sheet 24 and that in the same way describes why floor space ratio is used and how it's calculated and some precincts under 2005 do have a floor space ratio already but a number of the areas have this density component and that's one thing that has been simplified under the draft LEP is that all of them will have a floor space ratio now so that's just a close up version as I referred to before about the way that floor space ratio is calculated so you can see across the top there I'm not sure if you can read it from where you are but if you had a single-story building and you had a land area of 500 square meters and a single floor that was 250 so half the area of the site then you'd have a floor space ratio of 0 point five to one so it's a relatively simple mathematical calculation and it's important to note which the fact sheet deals with as well that it may not be and often isn't possible to achieve the maximum floor space ratio because we need to account for things like landscaping and pervious area and things like that so similarly floor space ratio is also mapped now and that is I'll give you the close-up version ratio the numeric value on one side and then a letter attributed to a particular color and that's represented on the mapping there so I suppose those two provisions are the main the core development controls or the core density provisions that are within the LA p and most of the others are moving to the DCP and now we're on to strategic tourism in the recreation study from Martin beverage I'll thanks Kim and hello everybody I'm just going to talk about Jill the background studies that were done for the draft LEP the first one he says this strategic tourism and recreational study just firstly though I'll just tell you a bit about how we've approached the background studies bearing in mind that what we've been doing with this whole exercise is the translation of existing planning controls we haven't adopted all recommendations in these studies where where a recommendation supports councils existing planning policy that's been included in the new LEP where there's been a significant policy change we've deferred that and we'll give that land use plan that's going to be quiet when the new planning legislation commences and some of the recommendations may very well fall outside the ambit of town planning or planning controls and we'll try and pick them up at an appropriate stage and refer them on to other parts accounts that might be required to deal with them so the strategic tourism and recreational study was done by a team of consultants the Stafford group who's quite well known within the tourism industry and Abigail Goldberg who did the town planning component firstly it looked at supply and demand for tourism in the Blue Mountains and it did find there was a lot of demand it contributes something like 400 million dollars to the local economy something like thirteen percent of the of them local employment is within the tourism industry echo points the most visited landmark in Australia is something like two million visitors per year so it's quite important to the local the local economy I did note that there's a number of challenges to I guess tap into that growth for trips it's found that there's not a lot of attractions to encourage people to stay more than just overnight and the challenge is to convert those day trippers to overnight stays and it found that one way that we could do that is to try to tap into new and emerging markets for example at mention there's a burgeoning Agri tourism industry in the mega Long Valley what else but spoke about an overnight trekking market there might be some opportunities there that council can tap into and as well as that at the other end of the scale I guess the need for some international brand type hotels might also help it also identified some sites that might have two rows and potential and it picked out sites like the Lawson golf course or the Queen Victoria Hospital at wentworth falls and just on a raw tourism potential it did find that those sites as well as a number of others did have a lot of potential it didn't go into any detail and looking at what other constraints might affect those sites and which of potential sites it was yeah very some very good findings there I guess the key opportunities for Council are to address some of those challenges and there's a number of ways that we could do that but bearing in mind that this is just a translation exercise that we doing with this LEP we couldn't pick them all up what we have done in the LEP though there's a whole list of land use terms that do relate to short term accommodation and there's three of those that are new there's the third one farm stay accommodation is eco juras facilities and holiday letting which have been introduced into the LEP for the first time and in a fairly small way that would provide a diverse diversification of types of accommodation that could be used by visitors to the area are to supplement those terms some special some specific clauses provide further information about I guess the controls are so ciated with those uses for example bed-and-breakfast specifies how many how many rooms can be included in the facility rural a nature-based tourism development a range of types of accommodation that can now be developed in some mental zones and the rural zones and just specifies what the development controls our around those uses so that's mainly what we've done in the LEP to pick up findings of that study I would refer you to attachment 14 which summarizes all the recommendations of that study and it just says how for each of those recommendations council has or intends to address them in the future so I coming on to the employment land study now that was also done by the same consultants goal Goldberg and the stepford group the idea was to try to take detailed look at the employment lands in the Blue Mountains and to see what could be done through the planning system to stimulate a bit more local employment and I guess is a bit of context that there's something like 34,000 people who live in the Blue Mountains who have jobs but something like 18,000 of them travel out of the area to work and that's that's a leakage of about sixty percent as well as some inconvenience to those people so we think anything that we can do to stimulate employment in that in the existing areas would be very beneficial to people so the studies that's looked at mainly the industrial areas it hasn't focused on the economic zones in the town centres just the employment general zones and the employment enterprise zones in AP 2005 and the light industrial zone in LEP 1991 and it looks in quite a lot of detail at 11 employment precincts going up and down the Blue Mountains just to give you an example of how the study addresses and looks at the different precincts we'll just focus on this one the itanagar Road blaxland precinct it talks firstly about the overline planning controls the objectives of the zones looks at the zone and it also looks that I guess the physical amenities some of the physical constraints we to the site's parking provision it does a very detailed subdivision analysis looking at lot sizes adjoining land users occupancy rates things like that so that's quite a detailed investigation you condition they're in so I don't think we've ever had a study that's taken such a detailed look at these types of land uses us we're quite pleased with a study again it's just showing the subdivision pattern and that sort of information so having done that then for each precinct looks at the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats and it looks at locational features proximity to Sydney which can be a strength and a weakness looks at the impact of adjoining land new system for example finds that the possible odor from the adjoining tip might impact badly on that that particular precinct so having done that analysis are then decides what might be the most appropriate future I guess position for that particular precinct and that ranks each of the precincts according to four different types is this one's called enhance there's another one called optimize which basic and optimized basically means that it can be become a lot more active and has more employment potential this one enhance is basically focus on organic growth in other words just a making a recommendation for that type of precinct that does make recommendations for planning controls and some of these have been incorporated into the LEP for example it talks about a maximum height of 10 meters into the in this precinct and that's an increase in what planning controls currently allow talks about an f sr of 121 presently the fsr point five twins so that's quite a significant increase it talks about change to the setbacks as well and the key the key aspect of what they're trying to recommend for the planning controls is for the LEP to provide greater flexibility in the planning controls in the hope that that would simulate a greater range of uses again bearing in mind that we're basically doing a translation exercise we haven't been able to adopt all the recommendations in full plus we think we've picked up the spirit of them and introduce them in a way that complements our best fit approach so again the recommendations that support our existing policy we have tried to pick up including changes to the floor space there's a significant policy change we will review that when we come to do the local land use plan which will do when the new legislation comes in and other come from other other recommendations falling outside the planning system we will follow up in other ways that's about all that's all I can say so I'll just hand over to Andy I sorry you have a question yeah hmm the zoning under the draft really reflects the current zoning so the constraints and the constraints would have to be considered in the DA process we haven't_''_1949.51 we haven't gone through and looked at rezoning industrial areas to another you saw in fact any generally speaking any other sites because we're trying to maintain our existing planning policy look the respondent said the background studies and all of the information is available so you can see the full context to the background studies and where they're recommending and then how we've taken those forward it clearly set out in some of the other attachments so please see where we've done constraints will be acknowledged but actually in terms of the zoning then and not mapped because we are continuing with our existing arrangements so that's really just to clarify that point just in terms of timings as I said at the outset we were working on a conversion process on the basis of 2005 July 12 we received instructions said we've got to work on a standard issue based LEP and it was very clear that if we didn't other things could well occur to to our planning powers and as a result council resolve that we would seek to engage the standard ishment process so that's been quite a quick process to date Council adopted a standard instrument based LEP for the purposes of public exhibition in September we receive gateway determination on the first of November we received final clarification on our exhibition process the week before we went out an exhibition so at that time we secured a three-month exhibition process so what we're doing now is very much kick start we know the timings not great but it's about getting people want particular briefings then we're quite happy to provide those subject to Darius and calendars we can come out into different environments but we are we have got quite a concerted and concentrated on the communication that's in place already so in terms of community engagement sorry I go back there in terms of exhibition locations first up all of the information to the back of the room said that the actual planning proposal mapping and the like is in three libraries so it's in Katoomba library springwood library in blacks in library there are copies for loan at those locations on a three day loan as well if people would like that in terms of the notification postcard this went out as soon as we had notification that we had till the fifth of March we know it didn't arrive with some people until later last week the first ones were arriving the week before nets we got a distributed through australia post as soon as we could but hopefully that's given people our route into the process in terms of the website on the web as Michelle said earlier each of these sessions are being videoed so the for information sessions will hopefully be up online very early next week I think the three today but in close there so you know that information is there and all the presentation material is there also where we have questions from evenings like this or from members of the public coming into a drop-in center that we think of al you'e before others to know where we're landing in the advice we're giving we're putting a Q&A and we're populating the bottom of that as well so there's a mine of information there numerous fact sheets 31 of them in total clearly some are focused on the business and industrial area and on their development control so perhaps for the purposes of the target group tonight there are some there are some particular ones that we'd encourage people to look at this is the fourth of these so we won't do any more of these type sessions but as said before we are willing to come we need to supplement what we've done to date and if there are particular questions from target groups or briefings required then we're very happy to do that and particularly if we can get some questions up front yeah so if we can get some some decent questions that people ask and we can go in inform to provide the best possible advice what I would say you'll see at the back the the information or the actual draft LEP is huge it you break your arms with it it's a big the mapping is it's a thing of itself we've been just get it all on one LEP once or a USB on LEP one USB which contains all of the information we've got copies here to know people like to buy a copy that also contains all the background studies so if you haven't got all the relevant background studies already you'll see those on there and the attachments and the fact sheet so it's also not the fact sheets so I got that wrong so but the for your information in terms of any particulars you may have we have a drop-in facility at present and running nine till two in the Kitumba headquarters again will be organizing some venues for planners to be at in the new year so we'll be looking at venues up and down the mountains for occasional drop-in sessions these sessions aren't intended to be at site about site specific questions they're intended to be generic this is where we've landed these are the background studies and how we've taken those core provisions forward and if people have questions particularly they can't get to see a planner directly in the interim we've got an inquiries dle p dedicated link their questions come through we also have two dedicated phone lines which if you don't get the first planner it boots around the office until someone picks it up and answers your questions so we think we're doing a good job in terms of accessibility the key element however is making a submission that's the bit that council has to consider and is LEP back to the department so the submissions process is clearly articulated on the website there's a standardized format however we'll we'll take it in any written format you care to deposit that council or the the counter in springwood or by post so lots of ways to make your comments or inquire inquire in order to have your your voice acknowledged and then heard by council through possibly April May June time and to be considered formally you need to make a formal submission and that is the process okay thank you very much we've got a few planners in the room if you've got particular questions we're going to hang around and we can probably do those less formally now if that's okay and which is close the presentation down you
One soon after the fires I announced free access to the Blaxland two for residents impacted by this awful disaster but that small regional facility was never meant to cope with something the scale of which we're seeing now and unfortunately the black stem tip is full to the brim Blue Mountain City Council will continue to welcome small amounts of uncontaminated waste from residents impacted by these fires for no charge a larger amounts the government has just announced a 10 million dollar package that will see them taken off the Blue Mountains free of charge to residents if you have a small uncontaminated delivery from your fire affected property please bring it to Black Sun tip and will welcome it for no cost for larger amounts please wait just a few more days until the government's 10 million dollar package swings into effect
Oh we're here today because the crossing of the blue mountains by blacks and loss in the month worth 200 years ago was a pivotal moment in the foundation of what would become the nation of Australia the colony at Sydney Cove was not able to feed itself and needed to find grazing land west of the Great Dividing range and the passage of those three gentlemen they've got to appear 200 years ago blaxland Lawson and Wentworth looked out across the heart lavallee and changed the face of Australia today to achieve this walking in here was belated one till great I thought it was an achievement we've reached the end of the blue mountain is ready to drop down into the valley below ladies and gentlemen I salute you because we have made it we are here well done to each and every one of you but john o'sullivan first and foremost this is your moment gratulations as where are the Blue Mountains it is that beyond word privilege does not encapsulate what it means to me to be able to be here at the event that we commemorate that occurred 200 years ago and gazing down in the beautiful what we know now is hardly veil with absolutely pivotal moment in what would one day become the Australian nation we can't always forget either that it had a very detrimental impact on the ancient aboriginal nations that had roamed this area for some 40,000 years we remember that we commemorate that also we meet here more than anything else to commemorate the power of a dream of a vision and it is jon's vision for so many years six years to walk these blue mountains with a team in period costume to reenact this event we've been at 18 days and we have finally made it you know like it's absolutely tremendous here at Mount York just overwhelming with the response and everything here now York and the Blue Mountains is a place of such recognition and commemoration and the responsibility is now in myself my generation and future generations to act as caretakers and respect to this beautiful place it is also my aim to be here for of rotary and some very dedicated community members who wanted to see this as a wonderful lasting memorial or memory for the Blue Mountains and Beyond and trying to preserve our history which is so important and I think the communities embrace that so much that now they've taken such an interest in the history as it's been going there digging into their own past into their own little communities these events the coins the barrack van the recreation the books that have been written all of the events that have occurred the busts and the bronze ones soon to be in place in those towns of Blaxland lawson and wentworth falls are all the product of people having belief and they go in them to go out and make it happen and it is the absolute responsibility of councils and governments to facilitate people with that energy and I'm pleased to say the Blue Mountains Council lithgow City Council a hawkesbury Council bathurst penrith and Oberon have all been harder what remains for all of us is the memories that we have having been part of price that can be put on you
Now bears from sydney so-called lgas of concern will finally meet with the new south wales premier of gladysburg jupiter this morning for the first time since sydney's lockdown was implemented nearly three months ago boomwood mayor john faker will take part in today's virtual summit he joins us now john good morning so what do you want to tell the premier well I'll be echoing the concerns that I've been hearing from my residents daily and I'll be telling the premier the impacts that lockdowns are having on the people in our communities and the impacts it's having on jobs small businesses mental health so I'll be raising the need to give people hope for the future and rewarding areas like billwood that have been doing the right thing with low covert cases and higher vaccination rates so do you think it's unfair that uh bird and suburbs in your municipality are caught up uh in the heightened restrictions well it's totally unfair because we've only got 69 active cases and we've got adjoining councils that have nearly residents keep and constantly telling me that they are feeling discriminated against so today I'll be pleading with the premier to take the wood off the list of hot spot areas because it makes no logical sense our residents are doing the right thing by complying with covert restrictions our residents are stepping up and getting vaccinated over 80 percent of my community has now had their first vaccination which is amongst the highest rates uh in the country so the premier needs to be rewarding communities like forward that are doing the right thing not punishing us by keeping us on as a hot spot area okay but so realistically john what are the hopes of that happening after the meeting well I'll be pleading with the premier today because it makes no logical sense it makes no logical sense that you've got a community in billwood that can have a picnic for two hours yet outside hotspot areas you can have a picnic for more than two hours so tell me how is it safe to have a picnic for two hours yet it's or not and these are the absurd and unfair rules that you know my community hate um they hope they hate them because they're completely and totally irrational and they make no sense john vega mayor of wood uh thank you uh for joining the headquarters shaping up clearly it's a pretty robust meeting between you the other mayors and the premier folk thank you have a good morning okay let's
G'day it's john faker yamir here and I am in the beautiful village park and I wanted to give you an update on council sustainable build plan which recently got the thumbs up now that plan is about our vision to make forward a sustainable and environmentally friendly community for the future and by the end of the year I'm happy to announce that we've signed an energy plan with one of the energy companies which will mean we will use 100 renewable energy for our council buildings and street lighting which I'm really excited about some of the other key components of the plan is that we're going to try to re-harvest and recycle more water that's why we're spending nearly two million dollars on upgrading the pond here behind me in billwood park we've also over the last couple of years you may have noticed we've planted over 1200 trees increased our tree canopy cover to 25 but that's not enough and that's why I recently put up a mineral minute for the upcoming budget to plant even more trees in the future and we've had some great early results on our fogo trials which is our food waste recycling into compost in our green waste bins which helps reduce our landfill areas so keep an update you can sign up to our e-news we care about a community and that's why we care about our environment so great work board and we'll continue to do this together to make our area a sustainable and environmentally friendly place to live work and enjoy you
 g'day billwood just here at everton road pocket park at stratfield delighted to see the finishing touches on this 200 000 program we've got an outdoors and a table for public art and bench seats there for our community after lockdown to be able to come and meet and socialize and make it a real active space and some great beautification works here type of program that I'm really passionate about ensuring that we continue to roll out across our community keep safe forward we're going to get through this together I'll see you soon

I've just been through and and seen in the community hubs seen all the different artworks and they're amazing we had 72 entrants this year 72 entrants from emerging artists to establish artists and in billwood we want to actually send a clear message we want to send a message to the community and to the arts community that we are taking the arts very seriously we want to continue to grow this event that's why this year we've actually grown the prize pool um to 13 and a half thousand dollars and where we envisage that we will grow that even more in the future I'm also a big thank you to our local um or sorry should I say our judges who are here with us say that who were with us and uh had the tough task of picking the winners and the emerging artists and also uh some of those that actually on there for commending um so thank you for for being involved and at all our art prize events we actually change our judges so we get new ideas new judges um judging new artists is very very subjective to all of us it makes some people feel very happy and excited it makes you feel reflective on certain artworks I walked through and saw some of the artworks that were of for example the ibis in billwood park there was one with regards to build chinatown showing the diversity the diversity of this community the diversity of our arts and why we should celebrate it and council as I mentioned is taking it very seriously in wanting to make bird a real center a rule center to encourage local artists but to bring people's ideas and views and the diversity that reflects our community it reflects our community through our art and that's why we're actually spending over on public art alone so a million dollars over the next two years and you'll actually see locally here like in unity unity place you'll see some of the public artwork that's available we just recently completed um some artwork in wangle park which celebrates aboriginal art and celebrates and recognizes the six seasons of the of our indigenous community in in the park also looking at emerald square if you actually walk up the stairs here through unity place now you'll see some of that public art taking shape and we want to see more of that more of that to celebrate these great ideas art's very not just subjective but it actually brings people and communities together it opens up discussions and it brings young emergent emerging artists like one of our young winners today who was doing this as a hobby and decided to enter and and has won a prize and hopefully this will encourage more emerging artists to be involved to be involved and and tell a story tell a story through their artwork so congratulations congratulations to all the might be watching at a home through our live webcast to actually come into the community hub the artwork will be on show for the next month so you can actually come in and see the artwork there it's great to be a part of this I'm really proud of what we're achieving here as a council with the arts community and I'm really encouraged I'm really encouraged that this will only get even bigger and better in future years so well done once again and congratulations to all the artists and especially the winners tonight thank you thank you mr mayor this year we've made a number of key improvements and changes as we grow further the burwood art prize so this year we've expanded the art prize to include digital still images for the first time as you're walking through the hub tonight you'll see up on the screens those images interchanging alongside the painted works we've also increased the total prize pool to thirteen thousand five hundred dollars so that means for the burwood art price the new and emerging artist category it's a 2500 acquisitive prize which means that for both of those we get to retain the artworks for the enjoyment of the community and we permanently display those in the community hub area and of course the people's choice award will be one thousand dollars and this will be part of encouraging participation so if you're here tonight and you see a work that you've fallen in love with make sure that you vote you can go online there's instructions throughout the exhibition and this year our exhibition will operate all the way through to the 30th of march it's the first year we've also incorporated a theme so you'll notice that a lot of the artworks themselves actually reflect um the past present and future of of burwood so it's great to see bird itself reflected in the works and we've also for the first time included a huge range of free arts programs available to the community over the course of the next month that means if you come in here music workshops aboriginal art workshops and performances by live artists and musicians so don't be stumbled if you walk into the library and there's a live music performance throughout the month you'll see there's about 14 different music performances occurring over the next few weeks so please come back don't make tonight the only night that you visit this exhibition because there'll be lots more happening um so really it's about bringing life to the live the burwood librarian community hub as well so please have a look at the program if if you'd like to know more information have a chat to some of the staff here tonight okay so now for the the very exciting part

as well so congratulations to council for doing that and really making it central to how culture plays out in this part of the world um they really I think connect communities to place and affirm how important art making and experiencing art is to our lives so I think the public programs that we've heard about today are really going to help extend that experience for so many people in the local community my fellow judges and I overall were struck by the vibrant representations of burwood's heritage and the local community that resonated so strongly with our lives today and particularly during and post pandemic the works that we had the privilege of seeing a few weeks ago showed great skill and our winner in particular this evening has an amazing technique and a deeply familiar approach to the depiction people would know so well and we really felt that familiarity and that deep reverence for the local space that they brought to their work so before I announce the winner I'm going to mention a highly commended work which really brought the past present future of burwood to light for us and this person's connection to their community and that's a work called self-portrait with a lady in shanghai in 1930s in burwood chinatown by tatiana pentes congratulations tatiana so it's my absolute pleasure to announce the winner of the burwood art prize this year who receives a

click and collect in 30 minutes at bingley and we're offering customers same day delivery in selected areas of sydney conditions apply but the mayors of 12 hot spot lgas in greater sydney have just wrapped up this meeting with the new south wales premier gladys very jiggly and to look at a range of issues but primarily the current restrictions like the curfew and there are also calls for more outdoor activities to be allowed especially for people who are fully vaccinated because you can understand the frustration of locals but one particular lga more than just frustration because in fact the rest of sydney they're this group this covert hotspot group burwood council they were declared an area of concern on the 12th of august because the number of cases were really growing at an exponential rate in neighboring lgas and the movement of essential workers in and out of the area meant that burwood was deemed a hot spot suburb but burwood has very low case numbers and over the past four weeks they've recorded 69 cases of covert over a month and yet another hotspot lga canterbury bankstown recorded over 5500 compared to burwood's 69 and the city of sydney it's not a hot spot it's had 843 cases so why are they allowed to have freedoms that residents of burwood aren't john faker is the mayor of burwood he's on the line for us now john have you made any headway convincing the premier to remove burwood as a hotspot lga well deb I put exactly those comments that you just made to the premiere today and I actually wanted to explain to her the impacts that these lockdowns are having on people in my community and the impacts on mental health so I'm hoping the premier listened to us I'm hoping the premier will work with local councils and see us as a partner see us as a partner to work together so we can get our communities out of these lockdowns sooner so I'm hoping she's listening to us and I'm hoping she will take action did she give any indication that she would well look I think it's important that we give the a few days to take on board all the issues we've raised so at this stage we don't have any clear indication of action taken but I pleaded with her to take my council area off the hot spot list of councils considering that we have low covet cases and very high vaccination rates then I've got residents in my community who have had uh their first job at 80 rates nearly 80 percent so I think it's really important and I read reiterated to the premier today that it's really important she you know gives people hope for us off the hotspot list because my community's done the right thing they've complied with covert restrictions and they've increased their vaccination rates and realistically how tough are the restrictions hitting residents you say that that people are being impacted but the curfew is one thing and the restrictions on outdoor activities which we know that the picnics were allowed for the non-lga hotspot areas but within those 12 hotspot areas including in burwood you are allowed to have two hours of of recreation time has that small thing made any difference to to people and how they're feeling those rules are nonsense they're ridiculous I mean how is it safe to have a picnic for two hours but it's not safe to have it for three makes no sense and you know these are the things that are building resentments in communities and these are the things that are upsetting my community I mean we don't have a problem with people outside hot spot areas going to the beach or enjoying a picnic we just want to be treated fairly we want have low covert cases and very high vaccination rates some of the highest vaccination rates actually in the country well you've gone from zero to hero that is for sure when it comes to getting jabs in arms but we've heard repeatedly from the new south wales premiere that there would be room for lgas to be taken off the hot spot definition added to the group for other areas who might have higher rates but that hasn't happened at any point despite the premier in the chief health office saying that at the press conferences they're concerned about the city of sydney and the inner west council areas so I guess it doesn't give you much hope that there'll be any change well that's what's disappointing deb and that's why you know I put to the premier today that my residents are starting to lose hope because they can see a government that really lost control of this pandemic and doesn't seem to have a plan to get us out of this mess so it's been up to who have done the work by stepping up and getting vaccinated because we could see that that was the way that we could lift restrictions and get us out of this lockdown sooner so I'm calling on the premier to take on board what was spoken today the issues that we raised and really I'm pleading with her to take billwood off a off the list of hotspot areas because it makes no sense that it makes no sense why we continue to have these added restrictions which are really unfair on my residence and what about the outdoor pools because I know that that's been raised particularly over the weekend the weather's only get only going to get warmer as we head into into late spring and into summer and for many residents in in your neck of the woods the outdoor pools are the only place they can go to cool off well it would be great to be able to have residents uh you know in the outdoor pool at last year when we had covert restrictions we were able to imply a do that again so but it's really important at this stage that the premier you know goes to her cabinet gives them the feedback that the mayors have given her and takes these curfews which are silly these restrictions on how many hours you can spend outdoors whether you live in croydon or you live in ashfield is nonsense considering you know west council has higher cases than billiards so it makes no sense and this is creating resentment in our communities and our residents hate it they hate it because they're feeling that they're being discriminated against well when you've got case numbers as low as they are you've got a very strong case and let's see if we have any any action from the premier as you say in the in the days to come but um no actual announcement out of this meeting yet but you never know john good on you thanks for joining us thanks deb we'll keep fighting thank you for your support good on you john faker there the mayor of burwood
 I love working for billwood council because it's a small council so there's opportunity to get involved in projects you wouldn't be involved in otherwise and it really gives you the opportunity to drive change I love working at burwood council because of the great opportunities and the exciting projects I like working for billwood council because of the sense of community within the team I enjoy working at berwick council because of the diverse team and the welcoming environment I love birwid because of its diversity and its vibrancy the pace of change the level of growth is reflected in our public places they're alive and you can see this throughout the art works that are filling our local centers I love bellew because the food culture and beverages and sources I love birdwood because it's a vibrant cosmopolitan and accessible city I love birdwood because of the vibrancy and the cooler on our high streets I love burwood because of its wonderful nightlife be burwood be part of our community be part of making a difference be part of our exciting new future be part of our team you
So I think we've got everybody here welcome um to you all thanks for joining council's webinar thank you to professor charlotte hesby and dr amandeep hansra who are with us and we'll be answering questions that have been submitted I also like to welcome our state member jody mckay mp for attending I would like to begin by acknowledging the wongal people of which the land we are present and pay my respects to elders both past and present and that are joining with us today can I also just remind you that um this meeting is being recorded um so it's on record for council's um records um just a little bit we're going to ask um professor charlotte and doctor questions and we're going to rotate and then they will probably bounce off each other there's just under 20 questions available so we're going to slot some time in um the chat has been turned on but we won't be taking questions from the chat we will try to take questions if we have some time left so probably about 7 705 we'll have to finish up just quickly also as a way of introduction before I ask the first question professor hesby is the chair of royal australian college of gps for new south wales and the act she's also the head of general practice and primary care research at the university of notre dame and a co-owner of a general practice in glebe uh dr amon deep hensara is a gp who holds positions on the australian medical association and royal australian college of general practitioners jody did you want to say a quick word before I start with our first question yeah I'd love to just to say hello to everyone and thank you very much john for hosting this um can I also just acknowledge the great advocacy that you have made to try and sort out burwood as a lga of concern obviously our numbers are pretty low um you and I have written to the health minister um asking why we're still an lga of concern but I just want to thank you very much for the host this I've had my vaccine obviously um astrazeneca my two shots and uh thank you to um both of our um expert panelists tonight for answering questions and hello to everyone it's lovely to see you and remember my office is open to support you we're looking after people with food with general support around understanding the restrictions there's a whole range of issues that we're dealing with so if you have any issues just give us a call or send us an email and we're happy to help thank you jody and welcome um just quickly we're going to just talk through some of the key issues in regards to getting vaccinated right now which includes why the delta strain of covet is such a game changer astrazeneca and pfizer so what's the difference should I wait for pfizer or is it too risky where can I get vaccinated and what do I need to do and what high vaccination rates means for build and australia so they're the topics we're going to cover so dr hanstra I work um thank you mr mayor for having me here tonight and I just want to thank everybody for attending on a friday night um not that we can do much else in lockdown but I'm really grateful that you're coming to learn more about vaccination because it really is our weapon against this pandemic so vaccines have been around since the 1700s this is not new this is not new technology vaccines are safe we've been using them for lots of other diseases and have actually managed to solve a lot of other pandemics in you know in history um but essentially the way vaccine works is it's a safe way of producing an immune response to the body without causing an illness so I sort of treat it like it's coming in to help you train an army so that when you are exposed to covert the actual disease you recognize it and your body's immune system acts as that army to fight it off um so really the vaccines that we've got available um are you know either killed or immune system get ready recognize and fight it off so we don't end up with severe disease hospitalization or death from that disease I might keep these answers short because I think we're going to cover a lot so I might just head back um hand back to you and show it wants to add anything sir professor um I'll probably add more as I talk on the next question okay well professor then we'll go into the next question what is the difference between the two vaccines and the upcoming moderna vaccine thank you mr mayor and I'll just quickly say the same say the same things as um dr hansera it's a pleasure to be here and thank you everybody for being here and I'd like to also acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands that we're all sitting in um tonight um look the two vaccines that we have um are to use two different technologies for delivering exactly what dr hansar was talking about so what we know is that in the covert environment there's been about really good vaccine for us and in australia we invested in basically four of them so the astrazeneca and the fisa are two of these and they use different technology to deliver us with I like to call it a key to um open up our immune system to be ready to initiate that army of response if we actually get exposed to covert and so what they do what they did they're very clever they found that the spikes everyone would have seen a picture of that covered vaccine and it's a spiky little sticky thing and those spikes on the vaccine are the way in which that the um virus gets into our bodies and they they stick they're a bit like you know when you go out into the wind and you get one of those um pollen balls and they stick onto you they're very much like that except obviously much much smaller and they get into our respiratory tract in the first place which is why it's so important about us protecting our mouths and our noses with masks but of the spike which then our immune system can use to actively fight and prevent that virus doing the nasty things to us that it otherwise does but they use two different ways of doing it the astrazeneca one has used a virus that actually usually infects chimpanzees so this virus doesn't infect human beings at all it just causes disease for chimpanzees it's called a rhinovirus so it's slightly different but rhinoviruses in humans give a cold like illness as well so it uses that rhinovirus to that it gave that rhinovirus the same message as the coronavirus or the covered virus so that when we get exposed to that particular pattern of virus we actually create the key that means when we do get exposed to the covert we rapidly bring into line all of the immune army that we need to do so it's using a virus as what we call a vector to give us the immune response so it's not the covered virus at all it's a different virus but it gives us the same um you know it key you get the exact replica to be able to do the unlocking so it does that but with a different virus the pfizer is quite is actually quite different it uses a really really new um technology where it actually uses the thing called messenger rna where the messenger rna is part of our whole system of being able to tell cells what to do and it uses this technology to give a message to our cells it goes into the cell and it says this is the spike virus at the coronavirus make a whole lot of protein ready to fight it so again it's delivering the same spike as the astrazeneca but in a different way instead of through a virus it's actually through a technology where it's delivered to our own cells and it's our cells that then directly make the response I hope that's clear um mr mayor you can tell me if I have made that clear enough or not and just on the meduna so how is the moderna vaccine yep great question madonna is exactly the same company but it's using the same technology so we call it an mrna vaccine so both moderna and pfizer are the same which is why they've got very similar sort of side effects whereas the novavax is the same technology as the astrazeneca so it's using the same idea of using a virus as the way of transmitting it so we have sort of basically four viruses I mean four vaccines potentially in the country that use two different technologies awesome and so really what they're doing is is the way they're made is just training your immune system to fight the virus so it's not the actual vaccine it's your immune system that's exactly right so it's not the actual virus it's a bit of the virus so what they found is that the with all viruses there's one part that our immune system will actually detect respond to and then use that as the mechanism to come and fight it with our white cells so we've got an army of white cells waiting to go um work so as everybody's had their diphtheria tetanus whooping cough hepatitis b all of those vaccines use similar but different technology to deliver the same sort of message to our immune system the flu is different the flu virus it does what we call an inactivated virus so for the flu they are actually using the the actual flu virus itself but they stop it being active but they use the pattern of that virus to then give us um a flu vaccine excellent I i watched a video which showed that it's well sort of like a bit of an animation that explained it really well and it showed when I was doing my own research and it was pretty much like I wanted you know the old wanted signs in 100 years ago in in west america when they were wanting outlaws so it's it's training your immune system to have the covert sign as a wanted sign so when it sees it it goes out and attacks it excellent so professor has been just on that also following on that so what are social media at the moment people are saying you know they're coming from all these different things can you sort of clarify how they're made or what they're made of um well it's it's quite complicated but basically they use proteins in um a laboratory to be able to generate that message it's incredibly high-tech and they use a variety of different messages to make that particular protein message sometimes they'll use other cells a lot of the things that we a lot of them fantastic medicines that we use we use an animal cell to actually make the pump out those proteins for us so in the same way that's what they do with a lot of this technology but the things that we a lot of the time we react to is the sort of the proteins that the vaccine itself sits in um to stabilize it what we call neutralize it so that it's able to be um ready to go when it's injected into us which is why there's a lot of this sort of dilute it down and then we have to um and we keep it in fridges at a certain temperature so it's it's um kept very exactly the same all the time sorry and just quickly before I go on to the next question one of the questions we get asked a lot about or you hear people talking about is will the mrna which is a physical vaccine change your dna yeah look and that question has come because of the fact that this is called a messenger rna and it goes into your cells and so no it doesn't change your dna at all messenger rna's job is not about changing dna it's it's like it's pretty much like a postal service so basically what it's doing is it's actually acting like the post the an envelope it puts the the message that we want inside an envelope and it then finds the right postal box hole posts it into our cells and then our cell which is where the dna comes in actually has to respond to it and in a dna form to respond to that key message but it doesn't change our own cells in any way it's just giving us that key message about how do we respond to covert by the covert virus when we're exposed to it thanks professor and doctor hansa so leading on to yourself um will we need two doses like so do people need two doses and there's a lot of talk now with what's happening overseas will we need a third dose or a booster dose here in the future and what what are your thoughts on that yeah so great question look both um vaccines that we're using currently in australia the the pfizer and the astrazeneca both require two doses um and people would have been told about some some of the changing kind of intervals we've been talking um through with both of those which are in response to what's happening in the environment so with um with astrazeneca some people might have heard that we've brought the second dose forward just to be able to get two doses are better than one so what happens when um as professor hesby was talking about this some vaccine enters our body um and encounters our immune system it activates two different types of white blood cells and these are the cells that are going to fight the infection so they have these cells called b cells and the b cells make antibodies and many people would have heard about antibodies so antibodies um sort of a generated against the specific virus that that vaccine's for so in this case against covert now that cell is kind of short-lived so it's like the army that you train up and then they get a bit lazy and they sort of forget and they have a bit of a sleep um so a few weeks after you've had the vaccine um you might have a lot of those antibodies but they start to sort of go down in their amount unless you give that booster so when you're going for that booster and there's that specific time period because they've been extensively tested and researched of the vaccine there is um activation of the second types of white cells which are called the t cells and the t cells um they call memory t cells because they hang around for longer and some in some cases even hang around for decades and remember how to identify those particular virus particles so recognize covert potentially um so those helper those t cells um that have that memory are really needed for that longer term protection and you don't get a lot of that with just one dose with these particular two types of vaccines we've been using in australia so we do recommend for the full course that you get both of those vaccines so you get both kinds of white cells activated those b cells and those t cells so that second exposure to the vaccine is the one that's going to create that strong immune response to fight the virus that you need now people are asking what about the third booster what about um like with the flu shot we have to get it every year um and we are think we're going to need booster shots if we do and when we will need those so there's lots of clinical trials some of them have started to publish some data saying that there is some evidence that our immunity does start to wane after a period and that for some people in particular and you'll hear in other countries that they're starting to give third doses to people who are immunocompromised so those people who don't have very strong immune systems and may not have responded very well to the first two doses of the vaccine because you've got to remember when we give you the vaccine we're requiring your immune system to mount that response you're training your army if your army isn't very strong they might need another pride like a third dose and so some of the countries have started to give their doses um sort of eight months after the first course we don't yet have an idea of when booster doses will start here in australia but there is a likelihood that we will that we've started to order those and there'll be a lot more vaccines coming into the country in the new year um and including moderna and some other vaccines so the third dose is most likely will happen but we just don't have a specific time frame interval yet okay and just just on that so do we know if we're going to need like a yearly shot like the flu shot for example or is that still uh we're still unsure about is science still unsure about that yeah look we're still unsure about that I mean one of the other reasons we have regular annual sort of flu vaccines and some of the other vaccines that we have um more often than once is because there can there are variants that um can come about so this is where there's slight variations in the virus and you know people have heard about the delta variant to death so um you know those sorts of things mean that there might need to be a slight tweaking of the vaccine every year to like the virus comes in and says oh look I know you've trained your army this way but if I try this other mechanism to get into your body and affect you you know then I can evade you know your immunity and so we will have to then give them a vaccine that is you know I guess in response to that variant so it's likely that as long as we have variants sort of appearing that we will need to modify the vaccine and give regular boosters but again so much of this these early stages because we haven't monitored covert for years and years like we have with other viruses um to know what might happen into the future okay and so just on that there's some people that are talking and asking questions can you get a mix of the vaccines like get one shot as a zed and one shot as a pfizer or is that recommended or so the recommendation is for you for your two shots is astrazeneca or pfizer and you should get the same for that for you've had an astrozenic and you might not have the second or a fisa you might not have a second is if you've had a serious reaction to the first one in which case you know you get doctors involved and there's a decision made to not give you another dose of that same vaccine but that's incredibly rare um everyone else is recommended if you've started with astrazeneca to have the second dose of astrazeneca and same with pfizer now in terms of boosters that may change for boosters but certainly for the first two you should stick to the same same vaccine type okay excellent and just quickly before I head back to professor you mentioned variants of the virus and how it's moving from variance is it more likely if you have more unvaccinated people in your populations that it will become more variant and it's as important or does that not matter look what we're finding globally is the variants that are emerging tend to emerge out of countries where they've got massive large scale outbreaks um variant which you know started in colombia there's been lambda which was also south america so often it has been in response to lots of the virus circulating in in an environment um allowing the I guess the virus to to mutate in that environment because lots of people have got it um so certainly the faster we get people vaccinated you know the larger we coverage we have and the quicker we kind of manage the outbreak the less likely we are to have these emerging variants that come up so so definitely you know what you're saying is correct okay excellent thanks doctor and um professor so just back to you um there's been a lot of talk about risks of vaccinations can you talk us through some of those if there are risks and what they are um well I think there's been an awful lot of information around about the risks associated with vaccines so it's like anything there's not a medication that doctors prescribe that doesn't have some adverse potential adverse reaction associated with it and so conversations weighing up the risk of the medication or the vaccine versus the benefits so with astrazeneca and pfizer and moderna there are slightly different risks associated with both but let's start at the beginning all vaccines by and large and everybody all know this tend to create for some people a sore arm and sometimes feeling achy and a bit off color in that sort of first 24-48 hours after having it lots of my patients tell me about it from the flu vaccine it seems to be quite common um lots will tell me that they got the flu when they got the flu vaccine so you know what whatever so you you often will get symptoms similar to um that particular illness so in the same way covert vaccines will do that we see probably about 55 so you're more than likely to get a sore arm and to feel a bit sore and achy and get fevers with the astrazeneca you're more likely to get a first first vaccine and not very much with the second with the pfizer it's the other way with the first but you do with the second the other thing that we're commonly seeing with both but probably more with pfizer is your lymph nodes get um quite sore and um enlarged now when we talk about lymph nodes most people sort of know about it but you know you get lumps under your arms or in your necks and your neck and it's because we do the vaccine in your arm it's quite common to get sort of tender swollen painful lymph nodes in your arm and on that same side as I say to my patients that's a good sign because it shows that you're actually doing exactly what we want you to do because the lymph nodes are where those white cells that dr hansar was talking about actually go and live and and actually it's their camps it's like their army camps they they stay there until they're needed so if you get those lumpy sore um reaction then your immune system is is doing a good job um and but then the thing that everybody the astrazeneca there's this very very very rare um syndrome called tts which is a shortened term for basically um a react it's a specific reaction to the vaccine it is not related to any other medical condition that people have so it doesn't matter who you are or what you are there's nothing that you have that causes this it's just a very very rare vaccine only associated thing where your platelets which are the little blood cells that cause you you to help you clot make blood clots um get attacked your own body attacks them so you get falling numbers of the platelets so it means that you actually might bleed but it also makes the platelets sticky so you get these two things happening you actually get a bl you can bleed but you can also clot so although you don't have very many of these pla of the platelets they they're actually um more likely to cause clots and so we know that if you don't pick that up there is again an even rarer but obviously dying from it but we're talking if we look at australian data it's about one per one and a half million doses of vaccine people will die from this disorder all right now one per one and a half million that's not very common all right like really not common um and you we get we're far more likely to get clotting just because something else happened you're far more likely to be hit by a motor car crossing the street than for this to happen but because we have 25 million people in australia it is going to happen okay so that's the big the big thing we need to know so that's the astrazeneca and with the pfizer and the moderna they seem to with young men in particular but anybody can get it cause and inflammation in the heart and we call it myocarditis and pericarditis the myocarditis that's the muscle of the heart and the pericardium is the is the cover of the heart both of them can get inflamed now the good news is is that basically quite significant chest pain and discomfort and might need to be in hospital for a few days for that but again really rare we're talking you know one per 500 000 doses of the vaccine to actually significantly um affect you but probably a bit more common for people to get a bit of discomfort in their chest thanks professor so if people have an underlying medical condition what should they do for example before getting vaccinated look I recommend everybody who's got any questions about the vaccine talk to your gp your gp knows what your underlying conditions are they know your age your medical your risk of being sick with covert and it's sort of one of those issues where if you worried about having the vaccine because you've got medical conditions actually you're far more at risk of being significantly unwell with the covert virus itself so you're actually much better off having that vaccine than you are saying oh I'm too scared to have the vaccine because I might get sick well actually you're right you might get're looking today there were 12 deaths from covert today and most of them were elderly but there were some people who were in what we have we've seen there are been people in their 20s and 30s and somebody in their 30s died at home from covert um it's just not okay and we need to protect everybody from that much higher certainty of being sick and dying from covet itself than this really really rare risk of having a side effect from the covert vaccine okay thanks professor and and dr hansard just back to you so people we're hearing stories that people that are vaccinated are still getting covered and what happens if you do get covered if you are fully vaccinated and what could it do yeah look mr mayor look at you're absolutely right you can still get covered if you're vaccinated and I don't think um the vaccines were ever communicated as being the thing that stops you 100 from getting covered what we are trying to communicate though if you do get covered you're much more hospital have a serious um uh sort of disease course end up in intensive care unit or die and as professor hesby was saying a lot of the deaths that we have heard of um and each of them is tragic um they were people who were unvaccinated um I think the research from the uk has shown that if you're vaccinated you're 97 less likely to end up in hospital even if you do get covered so for those people who are vaccinated who get covert um they will either have what's potentially an asymptomatic infection so they don't actually even notice that they've got covered or they will have very mild symptoms like they would have a cold or a flu-like illness and that's what we're really trying to achieve here is to keep people out of hospital and help them you know go down the path if they are going to get the disease that they have a much milder cause and that they're much less likely to pass it on as well just with those decreased symptoms and if you do get vaccinated and you do end up in hospital you can be pretty damn sure that you're far more likely to have died from it than if you hadn't been vaccinated because if you were sick despite being vaccinated you're a person who was much more vulnerable so again it's you know it it shows the value of being vaccinated for people who do get sick um anyway so professor just on that if you just want to continue so who's eligible to be vaccinated and where can they get vaccinated okay so we're so lucky in australia basically our government has paid for everybody who is eligible to be provided with the vaccine for free so that is everything about it is is paid for by our taxes and at this point in time everybody who's 60 and over is eligible for an astrazeneca they're not eligible for a pfizer so it's just astrazeneca and can I just add in there we know that the data actually shows that if you are in that age group you a pfizer as well so a lot of people who tell me they feel pissed off that they don't get choice and I understand that we all like choice as australians but the evidence does say astrazeneca not only is it a really good vaccine but it's actually the evidence is is very good when you're elderly um or elderly I don't consider people who are 60 you know elderly but the older you are the better astrazeneca is in terms of protecting you then everybody aged 12 and up to the age of 59 are eligible to get pfizer and everybody aged 18 up to 59 are eligible to get astrazeneca so the only people who can only get pfizer are the 12 to 15 12 to 18 year olds so astrazeneca is not licensed to be delivered to under 18s and pfizer is not licensed for anyone under the age of 12. so at this point in time we've got no vaccinations for anybody who's younger than 12. fires are only for 12 to 17 year olds and astrazeneca and pfizer for if you are 60 and over and you do have an a reason not to have astrazeneca then you are able to access pfizer and so dr hans was talking a little bit about people who might have had an adversary a significant adverse reaction um or they have some other particular reason why they might not um be wanting to get astrozetic or might not medically be um eligible for astrocenica so professor just on that because you touched on a really important point with astrazeneca and how effective it is and there's this there's I guess I see it in my role there's some hesitant hesitancy for people to actually take it up um but astrazeneca is actually and you might want to elaborate on this is the traditional way that vaccines have always been made while you mentioned the files as a new technology that's true that's exactly right so it's it's a it is a technology that we're far more familiar with um and we we know it we trust it um and we understand the sort of and much newer um having said that both of them are performing fantastically well in terms of doing what we need them to do in terms of protecting us from as dr hanson talked about being so sick that you need to go into hospital and and or then ending up in icu and and or then dying and there's also some good evidence that both the vaccines protect us from what we call long covered and I think a lot of people aren't talking enough I don't think about long covert and that's where people particularly young people get the virus not that badly but enough to know a bit like having a bad dose of the flu and then continue to have quite significant problems with their health afterwards so for instance I've got a young woman that I look after who got covered in america so she didn't have delta um she got the original variant she was sick enough to be you know quite significantly sick but now 18 months later because she got it back in february last year still got problems with her lungs she's tired she's fatigued but she didn't need to go into hospital she was managed at home yet 18 months later her health is really poorly affected we know that with the um the vaccine it protects from that as well and professor that's great and and thanks for answering that and just to quickly touch on that before I go to dr hansor it's is I've seen many examples of residents and people that I know that have actually sent emails that have caught covered and I think we've seen a lot of these stories where they were people that didn't believe in vaccination and now they're actually encouraging people to be vaccinated because they're getting some of those experiences of long covert that you've mentioned there so it's really important so dr hansard the next question was possible side effects and what you need to do if you experience side effects I think we've sort of covered that but you might want to talk about if you do experience they make you wait for 15 minutes because if you are going to get a reaction that happens in the first 15 minutes but do you want to elaborate on that yes look thanks mr mayor so as professor hespe sort of mentioned um there are some side effects from the vaccine which are expected and kind of welcome showing us that your immune system is doing its job and starting to mount that army in preparation for if covert ever hits your body so that's a good thing um the first 15 minutes is really for those immediate reactions if somebody's going to have anaphylaxis you know an actual allergic reaction so we do keep people around we we observe and monitor them um and then when we go when they go home that's when they get those other sort of sauron uh we've got a people with what they they get soreness and they might get muscle aches and pains and um and most of those are self-limiting so you don't um if if it feels like you know your usual kind of had a flu shot or something um you know taking paracetamol or something that um you know you discuss with your doctor and and just resting up um and usually that goes away I think the the side effects that we worry about um are some of the ones that professor has been mentioned where if you are one of those really rare people that is going to have that um that bleeding clotting syndrome that we talked about before with astrazeneca that's where if you have an unusual symptom and the unusual symptoms can be something like a severe headache that doesn't go away with just simple rest or pain relief chest pain shortness of breath severe abdominal pain any funny bruising on your body or funny sort of pinprick signs anywhere on your skin those sorts of symptoms are ones that you should go and see a doctor about and we can do a blood test and with that blood test we can diagnose if you've got that syndrome and we can treat and the important thing to remember with that is that a lot it's not the front of their mind after a few days post the vaccine so that syndrome as rare as it is can happen even up to 42 days after you've had the vaccine so I sort of say to patients even almost like six weeks after you've had the vaccine just to be wary of any funny symptoms that you're not sure about and always err on the side of caution your gp is not going to get upset with you if you go and see them if you turn up at the hospital with any of those symptoms no one's going to say oh you're silly for coming in we really want to encourage people um that if you can't present we can treat you diagnose and treat it and that you know it is incredibly rare but just to keep it at the back of your mind that you know within that period um and it goes same with the the fisa vaccine um with that sort of again not common um side effect of having the myocarditis the heart symptoms that seem worrying if you've ever got chest pain you should really be seeing a doctor um you know get medical attention you know we all the dental practice is still open we're still seeing patients we still want to encourage you to come and talk to us about any of those concerns so if anything serious like an allergic reaction is going to happen it usually happens in the first 15 minutes is that correct usually if it's going to be a serious reaction yes that's why we monitor people and just a quick one because I've received emails about this pregnant women what are the effects that could happen to them if they get vaccinated and should they get vaccinated or not that's the question yes they should absolutely get vaccinated um in fact they're at higher risk of you know poor outcomes if they do get covered and you've got to imagine many of these women may well be going into hospital and you know the risks of contracting covert may be greater for them so the um absolutely recommended vaccination for pregnant women so we're definitely prioritizing um women and any of you for trying to get pregnant um if you're breastfeeding and there's also the benefits and evidence suggesting that some of that immunity gets passed on to the baby which you know is incredible and important um considering the situation at the moment with the outbreak so um absolutely pregnant women should seek um their gp or their obstetricians advice if they haven't been vaccinated yet to get that in as soon as possible and one might get sorry professor I was just going to add and that's at any stage of pregnancy so it doesn't matter whether you're very early on or if you're already later it's safe at all stages and is is recommended by both gps and the obstetricians and what about for those that are trying to conceive a child is there any evidence to suggest that vaccination could lower your fertility no no evidence whatsoever it's another one of those myths floating around but look if you're trying to just a professor has these um comments around um any stage of pregnancy I've had women come to me saying I won't get two doses in before I have the baby it doesn't matter we at least if we get one dose in and then we can still um you know plan the second one for once you've delivered but it's absolutely critical that you still start on that journey um even if you feel like the birth is going to interrupt it somehow um absolutely critical and definitely if you're trying to conceive it's completely safe to have have the vaccine at that period well my sister had a very close friend of hers who was trying to conceive for years and couldn't conceive but had the vaccine and has since conceived now it's not because of the vaccine it's just by natural causes so um it does happen okay excellent now professor just back to you so with the delta variant which is the game changer now and which is affecting you know our community and our country others so why is it so different to normal covered that we had last year yeah it's a really interesting question mr mayor um and we basically right at the start in sydney that we we noticed how much worse it was at being infective so if I go back a year ago if you were infected and you were at home probably one in four of your family members would get infected from being exposed to you as a close contact with that covert variant now with the delta what we're actually seeing is a hundred percent a hundred percent so that means every single person in a household who is exposed to the family member who is positive is also getting covered unless they're vaccinated so we're seeing some really good stories about the protection of vaccines so it's just again if I use my own practice as an example we have an elderly lady who's six well she's 65 she's not that old but she's fully vaccinated she lives in a shared household with her family one of sorry I've got a dog one moment the joys of dogs are covered um lock down yes so um so basically every family member has been has actually subsequently developed covert except for herself and her husband who both were fully vaccinated with astrazeneca again a really good tribute to the the value of being vaccinated um because they were the most vulnerable members in that household but and nobody else was vaccinated but what we do know yes so it's highly highly effective it is much stickier and you need less of it in order for you to pass that um infection on again why we have to be so much more careful with wearing masks when we're out and about because the variant last year it might have been in the air but it was much less likely to actually be transmitted in a public place whereas this one you it just it goes finding people it sticks it sticks to you and it causes infections so just beware wear those face masks because apart from vaccination can I tell you your absolute armor that is on your nose as well as your mouth I see lots of them underneath people's noses that's no good you need it over your nose over your mouth and you need it when you're in a public space particularly inside so shopping centers shops and out and about in any of the places you interact with other people is a really really good protection obviously not a hundred percent and vaccination is what is going to then get us through this okay thanks professor so just quickly before I go back to dr hansra is so how long after like after you've been vaccinated how long are you usually protected for do we know yet um okay so I'll cover one basically with the vaccine it takes about a week or two for you to actually get protected from the dose one so um and then that gives you it gives you a bit of protection but not as good as as dr hunter said as the second one and after you've had the second one again it takes about a week the longer post second dose the better coverage you have in terms of then if you actually get infected with with covert with delta it does seem that people are being infected for longer than they were with the previous variant as well we're actually getting reports from the hospital of people who are still actively infectious with the delta four weeks after them coming down with the infection so by and large we're saying most people it's that you know period of time is sort of betw you know about two to three weeks but that's not the case for everybody unfortunately so there are some people who will actually be needing to isolate for longer because they're still actively um shedding virus thanks professor so dr hansar one of the common questions we hear also people that are on medication um will the vaccines interfere with those medications yes thanks mr mayor so not um specific there's not specific medications that you know we list and say okay this is a worry for you to be able to have a vaccination it medical condition that you may need to discuss with your doctor so there are not a lot of medical conditions that are what we call contraindications to that means you shouldn't have the vaccine if you've got that medical condition there aren't very many conditions at all on the list for those but there are there's a couple that might mean that you have to have one vaccine over the other um so it's always important if you do have any medical conditions um you're not sure if you're okay to have a vaccine or which vaccine that you discuss that with your gp don't make assumptions as professor hespe said it's actually even more important for most people with underlying medical conditions to get vaccinated early and you'll probably notice that from the national plan that we put out for eligibility criteria we put people who have medical conditions up first and early because we want to protect them because they're more likely to end up in intensive care or potentially die from the virus if they do're not sure talk to your gp about which vaccine you should have but certainly don't assume that there's a problem with you having it awesome thanks for that and this is a bit of a tricky one I guess because now there's a new variant that's emerging which is called the c 12 I think or c 1.2 I'm not sure that I saw something about it yesterday but one of our community members had sent this in and what are the dangers do we know of any of the dangers regarding that variant yet yeah so look the world health organization is monitoring all of the emerging variants and there are variants that are continuously coming through you might hear terms of the move variant and the lambda variant and and sometimes they're referred to based on the country where they've been picked up sometimes they're given greek alphabet names and sometimes they're given the more scientific terms um the the what who do world health organization is they monitor these and then they classify the variants um according so that either call it a variant of interest which is oh a little bit concerned keep in mind this or a variant of concern and obviously delta is a variant of concern when it meets the variant of concern criteria that's because it has the potential to cause more severe disease or it has the potential to be more transmissible or they have some concerns that the vaccines may not work so if it's a variant of concern such as the delta the who will list it as a variant of concern and then that's when we really start to get worried so I think we will continuously see variants that come up this particular one hasn't been put into a variant of concern by who um it's a every variant is being monitored so that may change into the future but I think people need to understand that variants are normal for all viruses and because we're being super kind of microscopic on looking at everything with covert you will hear a lot of things that may not amount to anything so that vaccines work for variants like delta variant and as I said before the vaccines it's not like we've got the vaccines and we're finished now those vaccines are continuously being worked on and modified and responding to any variants of concern that are coming up to make sure that any future doses that we need are going to respond to those variants um so certainly not something to be alarmed about and I think you know we'll certainly hear more if it becomes a variant of concern it's a bit like the flu strain that changes from time to time is that right yeah absolutely and professor so just back to you um there's there's always been a lot of talk and this is another question that's come through from one of our community members with regards to effective medications so there's been a lot of uh I guess uh news sort of going around on social media and and youtube channels and so forth that you can actually fight covert with medications and you don't need to be or something which is supposed to kill parasites um um did you want to sort of make a comment on that or answer that question on on what what the scientific beliefs are um I will so look there's been as we know when we first were exposed to covert we knew very little about it so there were a huge number of trials that went out about looking at effective medications and can I say one of the real joys about covert has been the way in which the medical and the scientific community around the world has collaborated together to do a lot of this work so that we can rapidly bring out evidence about whether things are worthwhile or not and then pursuing them now that's meant that we already have some really good medicines that have actually demonstrated that they help um people who are really sick with covert to actually fight it better and one of those medicines is dexamethasone which is being used in australia and around the world for people who get sick and actually makes people um be less sick very early on put forward as a medicine that might be of value and people looked at it both as a medicine to treat somebody with acute um covert and also as a medicine to prevent you getting it can I say that it has been disproven on both fronts to do either of those things so do not waste your time do not waste your money and please do not use it as a substitute for getting vaccinated um it is just not um proven to be of any benefit whatsoever whereas a vaccination does do all of those things for you there is a couple of medicines that have just been arrived have just arrived in australia um they're in this family of groups that were medicine I'll call them maps and basically they're very clever but they actually give you an antibody that fights the the virus with you when you're really sick so if you're a person who is actually not vaccinated and is demonstrating quite significant well risk of getting quite sick with um with covert but before you actually've got some other particular reason then we are able to now give that medicine in hospital to try and prevent you getting really sick so that's but that is not ivamectin and it is not um hydrochloroquine don't waste your time all your money with those they've they've been really really well researched around the world because they were put out there um big time and then they're not delivering um the results that you would want so there's no scientific evidence to show any drug that could be used as a prevention drug to catch and cover no there's no prevention drug for cover that there is a prevention for and that's a vaccine um and we have two of those in this country go and get one and just quickly before I go over to dr hantra for the last pretty much last question um so for people that have caught covert can they catch covert again yes they can um and it's an interesting phenomenon um so and again in australia we haven't really seen this countries like the united kingdom and in europe where they've you know they've been so much more battered by covert than we have we've been so lucky to have had such a good um well we've had a much better time with covert than those countries but what they've shown is that there are people who will get it um you you lose your immunity after not that long a period of time actually and then you're at risk of getting it again and it seems to be again more with some of the younger people who are not getting as sick um as as other people and so maybe it's because they're not mounting as good an immune response in the first place this is an area that we're going to be researching more which again goes to that question I didn't answer it fully about how long does the vaccination last for what we're we are seeing again with the evidence that's coming from overseas is that the both the pfizer and the astrazeneca are giving point we then they may start to need that third vaccine but we don't know if that vaccine how long that will last for because we haven't there hasn't been a long enough a period of time but the hope is that that gives you three four years of protection but it may well be because of the way the virus changes like dr hansard was talking about and like with the flu we may need what we then call a booster which is a vaccine that protects you more from the variants as they start emerging thanks professor and the final question we have is for you dr hansrell which is what is it that our bodies don't produce naturally to fight against um coronavirus will our bodies ever produce then and why can't we be vaccinated with something that will be a bit more permanent or be more permanent um look that's a tough question um look I think um we talked earlier about vaccines being used to to train and stimulate our own immune systems and I think it's important to all sorts of germs every day that we fight off and most of the time we don't even know that we're doing it um so our immune systems are fantastic things that we have as part of our physiology um but sometimes they're overwhelmed and sometimes they're exposed to new things that we haven't yet been trained or we haven't had experience with but the good thing about our bodies and our immune systems is they actually also evolve and adapt so that's not to say in the future that um just as the way that viruses change and adapt so do our immune systems and there is some research coming out showing that our immune systems because covert has been around for a little while um that they're starting to demonstrate some studies that we are starting to adapt our immune systems um over and above what vaccines are giving us so I think it's one of those things where we need to watch this space really closely and I i know that people are a bit anxious about that we're still learning as we're going along and learning really quickly and as as professor hespe said that the most amazing collaborations of research organizations globally coming together which is why we're able to do this so rapidly because we've got rid of all the red tape we're bringing all the research together we're centralizing any kind of knowledge um and um things that people are discovering and we may find that in a few years down the track that our bodies have adapted and we're actually like the flu you know much better at responding um with our own immune systems but we we really don't know and I think that's the important thing what we know is what we know right now and what we know is get vaccinated and that is our best protection against covert as of today um what might happen in a year's time you know we're still not there yet but today um if you've got access to a vaccine and whichever vaccine you have access to is the best's the message well thank you and um that that was our last question and thanks to all our community members for sending those questions in we haven't had any other questions come through on the chat and it's um just on an hour now that we've been going so I think we've covered um many topics on the vaccine I think what we really learned um and is that covert is real uh I think it's great that you you've been able to answer that and the best treatment or prevention for uh covert is the vaccination and uh the both vaccines that are out there that are uh widely available in australia at the moment is there a z and a pfizer um which are just both as effective as the other did you want to either of you add anything that we may have missed that you think you should add no I think just to reiterate dr hansar's final comments the best vaccine is the vaccine in your arm now and you have to have a first vaccine in is what gets you fully protected so go and get that first vaccine now we want to see you protected we want our community to be able to move forward and not have to be locked down dr answer no I think professor hesby said it all and if you don't want to do it to protect yourself do it so we can get to 70 and 80 and people can have some of their freedoms back and um and also think about your loved ones um you may not be badly affected by it but um I'm hearing heartbreaking stories of people bringing it home to people they really care about and get very sick so you know think about the others in your life so that's just my message um get out there get you know walk into a pharmacy book in with your gp book in with a hub just get it get it as soon as possible well thank you to both yourself professor and doctor for making time and yourselves available to join us on this forum I think it's been health workers I visited our hub here yesterday and uh it was just amazing to see all the medical staff and there was a doctor there and who was a local and also all the nurses and health staff that were there getting people through their vaccinations and looking after them the after care also was fantastic thanks again for your time thanks to all the community members that that were involved and participated also to our state member jody mckay who was on board just quickly before we go um just want to advise our residents that today we had a webinar with the health minister brad hazard and the chief health officer for new south wales dr kerry chan and we spoke about putting across taking billet off the hotspot area list considering we've only had a handful of cases over the last week but also that we can possibly get a permanent walk-in vaccination hub because it's important to get the vaccines where the people are because we're getting so much demand in build uh we did hear today which has been announced on want to subscribe um that they've extended the hub now till the 7th of september so that's for pfizer vaccines for those um that are still wanting to uh or sticking to the decision to get the fisa but there are a number of medical centers um and pharmacies in the build lga which are delivering the astrazeneca vaccine there's one on victoria street the medical center there next to jd mckay's office which is getting people through quite efficiently on a daily basis and it's great and it's great to see um so many members of our community that are interested have a good uh evening please keep safe and continue to ensure that you keep safe even for those of you that go out and get vaccinated still important that we still practice our social distancing considering that you could still transmit the virus even though you are vaccinated so stay safe and thanks once again for participating and thanks again doctor and professor for being involved and our council staff who have been working very hard behind the scenes uh helping number of forums coming up in the coming weeks thanks again and have a good evening you

Asbury nuclear was absent from today's cover 19 update instead holding an important meeting with mares from sydney's 12 hot spot lgas we're joined now by couple and mayor steve christo and burwood mayor john faker let's go first to you steve you've been calling for this meeting for a long time what did you speak about absolutely I've been calling for this meeting since day one of lockdown and thankfully the day came for the premier to hear some realities we spoke about western sydney extended lockdowns and curfews and the unfair situation placed upon our people and why as a number one area of concern due to covert cases we have not been given a vaccination steve your community has been hard locked down for months now but there was still 118 cases there in the past 24 hours how are you going to get those numbers down well we're doing our best to encourage the community to go out and get vaccinated but in the same statement it's very hard to get the numbers down when unfortunately the contact people the system is stressed and that's just the realities so we need to work out a way where we apply more resources into contact tracing so people are contracted when they've been exposed more quickly and within one or two days I know it's hard but it needs to happen or we're never going to get the numbers down whilst we lag roughly a week and a half behind in contacting people when they've had close exposure to clover 19. john burwood had just five cases yet you're under the same restrictions as lgas with hundreds of cases per day and the city of sydney had 36 cases that isn't a hot spot so is that all fair it's totally unfair natalia and it's not fair that my residents continue to have these added restrictions and I spoke to the premier today I put to her that our residents have been working really hard to comply with the covert restriction we've lifted our vaccination rates we've got nearly 80 of our residents who've had their first vaccination the same added restrictions and the impacts these lockdowns are having on our people in our communities the impacts to jobs small businesses and mental health and john how frustrating was it to see pictures of people at the beaches on the weekend when people in your community can only go outside for two hours a day well natalia it's not our we don't have a problem with people in the eastern suburbs going to the beach or you know enjoying a picnic all we want is to have uh to be treated fairly and have the same freedoms as people in other communities considering we have loan covert case numbers and very high vaccination rates so I'm pleading with the premier to have her government lift forward as a hotspot lga and to reward reward communities that are doing the right thing reward communities that have stepped up and lifted their vaccination rates as an example take us off the hot spot list john do you think the premier has listened to what you just said I hope she listens to what we've said because want to work together so we can get out of these lockdowns a lot sooner now it's really important about getting through this campaign and lifting our vaccination rates then she needs to work with local governments not work against us she needs to reward counselors and communities that are doing the right thing and by working with local councils now local governments she has access then to people on the ground she has access to communities we're out day in day out speaking to our residents and we can help the government and get its and steve after your meeting with the premier today do you feel like any progress has been made well the premier was definitely given realities and uh we expressed the frustrations of not only our local residents but the other local residents that are part of the 12 lockdown ogas and suffering curfews the premiere did not make any promises but she definitely got the message doubting and she took plenty of notes all right well thank you both very much for your time and all the best in the future awesome

the banjo a forgotten instrument featuring dennis quinlan and gordon brown okay welcome everyone we're here to play some banjo and talk a little bit about the banjo for you we've got a little show that we often do and it's called is the banjo forgotten instrument gordon and I this is gordon and I'm dennis quinlan we um we work together with it provost clubs and so on but we're playing for you now and we're going to tell you a little bit about the banjo tiny bit of its history and and we'll be playing some songs through there's sort of songs that a lot of people know and in any case we hope you song first let's play uh when you're smiling okay and we're going to do it in the key of c here we go I'll bring it in when you smile when you're smiling the whole world ring on the rainbow oh is yeah so when you're smiling so the banjo if you look at these two they appear to be pretty well nearly the same but this banjo that I'm playing is actually an american banjo it's called a v made by a firm called vega and it's a viega vox and this banjo that gordon's playing was made in adelaide australia and uh I might let him tell you a little bit about just briefly about it this uh this banjo is called a white swallow and you might see a swallow up on the on the peg head up there so it's the same sort of construction it looks much the same but some of the details are different so dennis's one for example is painted on the back this's got gold plating a little little diamontes around there to sort of snazz it up because back in the day when people played these things in vaudeville they needed something that was going to sparkle in the spotlight uh in in the heyday of banjo that's that's what what they used to do they used to sparkle and and radiate out and would be part of the act would be the instrument itself this has made an adelaide as dinner set by a chat called alan funk who sadly passed away earlier this year he was about 79 when he made this and he still made banjos for a number of years afterwards and the reason why I liked it not so much because of the bling I mean the bling is a is a plus but um and there's a number of reasons why people like different instruments and this particular one has a neck that that suits my hand uh for me it's it's it's it works very well uh it's it's comfortable and I like the sound of neck I had another viga banjo and it had a a different size neck a wider one and it never felt comfortable the other banjos I had and I do have an australian bench another australian banjo here which you might just see it's pretty plain it's like a plain jane and it was made in geelong by a man called uh duel um and a pat duel and um but its neck uh here that I'm holding with my right hand is about the same dimensions as this so when I play one to the other they I feel comfortable yeah about them that's one of the things so okay we we might do another song depending on when this program goes to where um it could be close to november and the 11th of november will be remembrance day and we're going to do a song that's a first world war song it's called uh it's a long way to temporary okay so we'll play it through uh in b flat and then and then we'll sing a us so here we go it's a long way to it's a long way is do is okay temporary so that's an irish song obviously yeah but it was a first world war song so we talked a little bit about our banjos being made in different countries in fact the english have banjos as well they have windsor is a name and it was strong in the 1800s late 1800s and into the 1900s now the banjo of course we've often discussed it it was very strong in the jazz age and that's the 20s and into the 30s and then during uh towards the end of the 30s the swing era came in and the guitar tended to fit in a little better and the guitar of course was lighter than these uh and a softer sound but about that same time microphone technology improved and so the guitar was became more favored and the banjo drifted away but it had a resurgence in the 1950s with a subsequently a film deliverance and there was banjo is around and uh gordon's just going to pick it up and then he can talk a little bit about I'll hold it while he perhaps uh so this this is this is a banjo ukulele so it's the same as a ukulele to play but it's built instead of having a guitar sort of shaped body it's got a round body like a banjo and the the most famous exponent of this was george formby in the uk george foreman was a big star in the 1930s and 1940s through the second world war and uh he was he was the top earning performer of his era and there's a nice little story about him uh at one stage his wife did all the management for him she was apparently a force to be reckoned with and uh she drove a good bargain and helped him with his financial success and at one stage she said I'd like a new car and she said well when you headline at the palladium you can have a new car and then due course he do you want he said I'll have a rolls royce wow and uh and so he got a rolls royce and after a while he was earning enough that he would get a new rolls royce every year and then a new rolls-royce every six months and then in the 50s he was getting a new rolls royce and a new jag every six months so that tells you how much he was earning uh playing just this thing here he was well known for he was he was in a lot of films but he had this sort of cheeky persona and there's a couple of songs in particular that he's well known for and this is one of them this is chinese laundry blues oh foreign mr me mr yeah he did um he made a film um in the isle of man where he was a rider in the tt races there on a funny looking uh motorcycle he thought it was a shuttleworth or something like that so he was yeah a bit of a do for you so let's look again at these banjos this particular one apart from having all the elaborate stuff has uh this is a maple neck on these this is the american one and it's all carved here on the heel and as I like to often say this is our superannuation in gold all around here no just not seriously and these have got what's called a deep resonator um other banjos only come to about here and there's a there's three main types of banjos these are called the standard banjo and they have 22 of these frets here gordon's is the same and they make another one which is shorter it's called a tenor and there's either 17 only or 19 of these threats and the tenor was known its tuning is the same as a viola and it said that during the um the depression when orchestra musicians uh of course all the way they fingered the strings here was the same and they worked uh in jazz bands and of course that's where all plenty of work if they asked for you to work for them you sort of had to do that and the third banjo is the same length as this but it has another one these are pegs we call those tuners just up here and there's another one that comes out of the side here with another string going on so there's that's the five string banjo and the five string banjo is favored with um with blue grass and folk music yeah so if you were listening to the beverly hillbillies or something like that or the film deliverance ding ding ding sort of sound that's the five string sound and and most banjos are in fact five string these four string ones like this this style is in the minority I think so yes these uh have the ability to you can play chord melody on it so you can accompany yourself if you're singing and so they're often people when they do learn the banjo after a while when they get skillful they think perhaps that's the sort of banjo why don't we what do we do um you want to do how about the tv commercial oh yeah that's a good idea we're going to play this song now and you'll mostly only hear the chorus of it but we're going to play the verse and it'll be interesting to know if you recognize it we'll only play it through once so already here we go one two three two two three I've got a song that won't take very long doing the right kind of if I strike it something we eat and I know it's quite sweet and I'm sure you are going to like it so I like aeroplane jelly is a good recipe aeroplane did you know the verse interesting isn't it yes that's is there I don't think the the gal that uh sat in the um the swing that did it because the aeroplane jelly's been around excuse the uh advertisement has been around since the 1930s and the the last that used to she'd be well in her 80s now perhaps she's still with us we don't know just coming into her prime I think she could yes that's that's good another interesting thing about these is this here this skin as it were originally the skins on them and that's the same as a drum and you could actually say this is a sort of a drum like thing or it could be uh is it being a stringed instrument is it a yeah is it a stringed instrument anyhow that's a minor thing but originally they used uh calf skins and they were stretched across and drums used them as well and the difficulty was I believe if there was moisture in the air humidity the they would stretch and this wooden device here that the strings go over would push down and they'd go out of tune and they were a nuisance and then eventually plastics came in and the this material is called mylar and you sort of put it on and it virtually lasts forever well not many people split one less thing that you you have to worry about these are I guess as as we said are four strings and they tuned c uh on this string g on this b and d c g b d for those that are musically interested so we might just play another tune and we'll change key in it we might do just do what you call bye bye blues yep yep it's that so we'll start in uh b flat yeah and then we'll go to uh two in b flat and one is yeah in c is that all right yes so so do oh yeah so we did a little keychains there we we started in b flat and we played in c so um I think now that we might just uh finish up with a tune that I'm sure everyone knows it's an australian tune the road to gundagai and uh there are two verses so we'll probably sing both uh with a little double ending type of thing how's that yeah is that all to know we're in the key of there I'm on my way is is okay well thank you from gordon and myself dennis thank you good evening we hope you enjoyed these great sounds join us again next wednesday at 6 p.m when we introduce in partnership with western sydney university burwood's rising stars remember to mask up get tested and get jabbed

G'day bird I'm in wongal park today and I'm really excited to announce that we're going to unveil some great public art in this great green space we've got two renowned indigenous artists madison gibbs as well as jason wings who are going to create some public art along the skate park they're going to also wrap the 11 solar light poles that we actually have currently in the park which look a bit too bland for our liking as well as creating these great murals across the pathway about the six aboriginal seasons which is going to take our park users on a journey we're also going to be creating two gateway signage programs here at wonga park so people can identify with the park itself this is another great partnership project between billwatch council and the new south wales government recently you would have seen we had a great pre-planting program here and this is just further evidence of why we love wongal park and we love our families and our friends and all our locals coming out here and enjoying this great bike
Today while it's been a challenging couple of weeks with the lockdown in our booth community I just want to thank those members and our residents who have been doing their bit to keep our community safe but it's really important that we don't become complacent so I want to encourage any of our residents that if you have any symptoms that please go out and get tested at one of the free covert testing centers and there'll be a link with a list of those centers after this message so while we are being relatively doing okay through the lockdown we want to ensure that our billwood community continues to keep safe and that we all come together to protect our community
Okay it's a decision thank you so I will now request to have um the hosting uh and I know now that I am the host so I can also share with you all my slides and my presentation so I'm just going to go grab the presentation oh one second sorry so with a show of hands or thumbs up could I have an indication of whether you are able to see my screen great thank you very much so I'm going to make this full screen for everybody's benefit great okay so what we hope to do today is introduce to you our information or the progress on our investigations and consult with you on the principles that we are going to utilize um to guide us in the next upcoming months of investigations within this precinct so today's agenda what we're doing today is as we have gone already through the introductions we are just going to briefly talk about the meeting protocols uh the background information that we're about to present to you and talk about a little bit guides this process and of course we'll have the bulk of the presentation concentrated on the principles that will hopefully guide us in the next few months of these investigations at the end we will have a question and answer session so please feel free to give us any input ask any questions or in fact give us any comment you feel pertinent to these proceedings all we ask is that we treat the comments or questions from the other members attending uh with respect and that we allow each person to have at their time to actually ask or ask their questions or voice their opinions at the same time we would like you to please hold your questions towards the end which is the question and answer session and we will endeavor to answer all of your questions today at this time I wish to our council wishes to acknowledge uh the one goal clan of the ura nation the traditional custodians of the area we pay our respects to their elders past present and emerging we acknowledge and respect their cultural heritage beliefs and ongoing relationship to then proceed to um the parts of this presentation that deals with the information and the background information to this um project so the process that we're undertaking right now is part of an amendment to the comprehensive lep review uh this is an overarching document that covers many parts of the barbed local government area however the parts that we are looking at due to the extent of this document involved other areas outside the bergton center such as medium density investigations to the viability of the medium density housing also we're looking into affordable housing as part of this round of amendments and we are actually looking at investigating burwood north precinct which is also known as the parramatta road corridor urban transformation strategy as this name is a bit long we also refer to it by its acronym or pr cuts and some other individuals actually say it as per cuts if we do say per cut or pr cut we are referring to the parramatta road corridor urban transformation strategy and which is also a alternative uh alternatively used a name that we conducting a more focused investigation into burwood north at this time so the answer is is that it is a large and complex precinct we have the advent of the better burwood metro station which will have its own strategy or actually a planning proposal led by the state government because they are the promoters or transport new south wales they are promoting that uh particular development but alongside that council will prepare its own planning proposal that looks into that area and what we're hoping to do is to actually move concurrently and have these plans inform each other so that is why it's important for council to actually spearhead this process now so that we move in parallel with the progress that is being done on the burwood metro station which will affect this area the area of investigation now the other reason why we also think it's important to reach out to the community now is because as of august of this year we have now a ministerial direction and that you might have heard is referred to as ministerial direction 9.1 or part it it allows landowners in this area to put forward a individual planning proposal so what council is attempting to do is put in place the infrastructure or the structure for us to be able to better assess those planning proposals as they come through we hope to work in collaboration with all the owners in the area or the proponents in the area so that we can evaluate the planning proposal as it comes but at the same time put enough information out there or have enough information investigated to better evaluate those planning proposals now the other reason why we hope to be prepared and have initiated our own investigations into the area is that for many years now we've been awaiting the outcome of a prison-wide traffic study this is now as we understand it reaching its final stages of completion it's been peer-reviewed so that we know that the findings in this study are um credible and holistic so we are we believe that this is very soon going to be available to councils for their inves for their review and we remind everybody and stratfield councils who are participants in these studies but what we are attempting to do is a precinct-wide analysis so that we're better informed about potential impacts in the future now apart from the imminent completion of the prison-wide traffic study there are many other steps that will follow this step we are at the beginning of the process and that's why we're reaching out to the community to ask them about principles because these principles which are defined as statement of guidance that will allow us to continue our investigations in a particular direction based on the community input are going to be the element or the information that directs council in a particular direction so we want the community to work with us handing hand along this process and we are hoping that we begin this long journey together and that there are no surprises for the community so we're coming out to the community at this very early stage which will be followed as you see in this list by a number of steps so after we collect the information from this council laws in as part of an issues paper in the early part of 2022 once the issues paper has been reported we will then follow a with a second stage of consultation which is going to then present some more tangible options for the build form that means how high how dense and and how many other elements in terms of new streets or parks or open spaces so we are very at the very early part of this process and we hope and we invite you to continue following this process with us now the planning proposal uh which will be prepared after these two stages of consultation has to be reported and it will be reported in several stages uh to the councilors and we will then make sure that the community is invited to those gate times or those milestones where we are reporting uh to the council lords which is a publicly um available information so these meetings where we're reporting will be communicated to the stakeholders and the community in general for their participation as well so the things that perhaps out of interest to you and you should be paying attention is perhaps when we receive a gateway determination that means that all of our studies have gone to the department of planning this is a state agency and have come back with a um determination that will lead with allow us to then put an exhibition so you will have a yet another time to be able to comment on these plans uh which and it will be a longer period of consultation for about 28 days minimum so after the public consultation and again reporting to counselors on that resolution we estimate that by the time this uh change or amendment is in force we're looking probably at the end of 2023. so these are processes that take time but hopefully uh we keep you informed along the way so that um we are then able to um keep you informed of the steps where you can continue to make or participate now there is um an overarching um strategy if you like that uh covers or actually it includes a number of aims and goals that also already strategic team and that is the city excellence strategy what that does um is that this overarching strategy in in encompasses and actually attempts to capture and capitalize on the growth the future growth of the town center and they are high level issues um but all of these issues will be very relevant for the burwood north precinct the economic function and role of this part of this strategy is what is going to ask us what is the mix of uses or the future uses of this precinct what will actually deliver the economic activity in this precinct and what will be the role and the function of bourbon north precinct is it going to be a retail precinct or is it going to have employment generating users apart from also having a residential component so but the uniqueness of this precinct not only is because of where it's located at the northern end of the town center but the metro and the added transport facilities that we're going to have you know are are elements of this strategy that will both give us some leverage a unique place that could become a destination so if we were to leverage appropriately on the strategic advantage of the future connectivity that this precinct will have it could become an exciting place to live an exciting place to work and what we're trying to do is hopefully leverage on all of these strategic advantage and do it well with the community input so that it becomes again an embodiment of these three principles and perhaps a an excellent destination place to live and recreate uh which will then complement our existing town center so hopefully all of these areas come together and with your assistance we do a great job in this precinct now let me now give you a little bit more information about what is the precinct that we are actually studying so what you see here in a black outline is generally the boundary established already and this is been communicated to you in our letter of invitation but this boundary here it was already established for some time it was it is not something that council has come up with unilaterally it was with the former urban growth of new south wales so any decision with regards to the study area uh precedes our time in the sense that it is been derived out of a number of larger and overarching studies that information has been in the public realm since 2016. so what we are doing today is that anybody who feels that there could be other there could be changes or modifications to that study area we will take that input and we will report it to the council laws but we are at the moment not able to change the boundary without you know further consultation however if any input is provided with regards to modifications to the study area that will be noted and reported to counselors as part of the issues paper now in essence this is quite a large precinct as you can see it has almost 26 hectares and it goes beyond it goes far beyond parramatta road which is rlga is south of the parramatta road corridor in fact um it is larger than um it goes all the way almost to um the chicken but the area of concern that is within our council area is to the south of parramatta road on the eastern boundary all along shaft berry road and to the west we are along park road on the southern edge it goes along comer street and miraila street so that area there at the moment uh does have some uh existing controls but hopefully as part of this process and the aim of this process is for us to investigate what changes we're going to make to that area if any or how how we're going to um apply modifications after a number or series of future studies and testing so but again before we proceed with this additional testing we need to actually have a set of concise principles again these are these are guiding statements that help us to figure out what would be the future desire uh context or character of this precinct so these will involve a minimum of eight areas including for instance uh what is the relationship to the town center height and density build form connectivity and workability and even open that we need to consult on okay well I'm about to begin um presenting more information with regards to each of these principles I just want to have before I proceed a little look into the room uh catch all of our attendees make sure everybody's still hearing us okay can we have a show of thumbs and see if I'm okay to proceed everything so far good all right thank you very much so the first principle that we want to ask the community uh about is we have a very established town center and is growing and it continues to grow how is going to be this new area is it going to be its own independent node or are we going to treat it as an extension of the existing town center so the question is do we create a independent little node something like the relationship between the sydney cbd and bondi junction there are two completely different nodes linked you know by by street or connected through other means of transport or are we going to create an area that is an between the sydney cbd and pyrmont or the rocks clearly has its own character but it is part of the same center so that is one thing that we would like you to tell us how you see this new center or this new part of the existing town center the other one is what will be the role of beverly north metro station it happens a lot lately that a lot because of the advent of the metro a lot of different neighborhoods in sydney have a choice between the existing railway network and metro examples of that could be for instance some leonard's could be chatswood another example is the cbd itself so the question for us that we would love to know is when you see the future of your of your neighborhood or this area do you think that you're going to prefer to use the metro or are you still going to give your patronage to the railway line and occasionally use for instance the metro station I personally have this question coming to me because I live in the lower north shore within a few blocks I'm going to have metro I think personally that I'm going to be giving my patronage to the metro station more often than the railway station out of convenience um because it's faster and it will link us to more locations within a faster range or speed of trains so we would love to know how you feel this is going to change your transport needs or usage in usage patterns in the future now with regards to the height and density um these are topics that sometimes could be quite complex but we're going to make it very simple for you to give us your opinion we already have a particular height and density in the existing town center should this area with the new metro be lowering height or secondary importance to the existing town center or because of the metro coming and the new advantages of how we can plan this extension to the town center should that area be taller or equal or taller to the existing town center do let us know your opinion we would like buildings or the densities across this precinct should we have a very consistent height to all the buildings you know images of very consistent heights of cities come to mind like paris you know very consistent in height or even barcelona or washington dc and only you see a few things that actually are taller well we can either make it very consistent or we could create opportunity for certain areas to be able to create interesting buildings or taller landmarks or areas where we create an iconic site so that would mean that at certain key points we create an emphasis or we create an iconic structure by allowing a variety of heights to be applicable to that land so again we can we would like to know which approach you feel is more appropriate in this location now in terms of the character is this going to be a purely residential precinct means that the activity at night only occurs on particular main roads primary or secondary roads like burwood road for instance and the rest of the precinct is actually quite um residential in character or are type of precinct where we have all these uses expressed across the entire precinct an example of this could be um the rocks or uh something like darling harbor darling square where you do walk through very active laneways and then you have apartments right around the corner so and at night um this question has two parts where we actually um make sure that we have activity either throughout or only along main roads or like parramatta road or burwood road now I'm about to finish the presentation I only have about a few more slides to cover so I just want to make sure everybody's doing okay great thank you so the other thing that we would like to know is in terms of providing housing diversity and affordability should we give priority to key workers families or early professionals so therefore should we provide a range of dwelling sizes or should we think further and as provide opportunities for assisted living for seniors or people that want to age in place or people with disabilities now all the models that could be interesting for the should we in general create controls to secure affordable housing in this area please let us know your opinion now in terms of connectivity and walkability we do have already a very strong grid of main streets and secondary strips should we keep that arrangement or should we add an additional layer of intimate language to connect us and make it a very pedestrian friendly environment either approach is is uh can be done very successfully but we are interested to know how you see yourself how you see this precinct in the future now the last uh principle that I wish to discuss which is very important for families and members of our community in general is areas of open space should we concentrate our effort and create a secondary larger space for open space recreation in this area which is you know a larger concentration of open space or should we provide smaller pockets pocket parts and the definition of pocket park is just a smaller part that is closer you know if we break that area into areas that are closer and they are in closer distance access to a little pocket park a smaller pocket park within a shorter walking distance so which approach would you favor as part of the future of this precinct so these are the principles that we are consulting um about uh through this stage of the consultation and we invite you to offer us your opinions or questions every question is valid but if you also want to actually record your opinion the same inform the same slides or the same information is um available online as part of participate burwood you just go in there and you'll find your way to the same information and you can actually give us your responses so we invite you to truly participate and give us your opinion so at this point I am finished with the information part of the session we're doing very well with time we have about 30 minutes to answer any question you have so feel free there's plenty of time and even if we are not able to answer your question tonight or you prefer to do it in a more private forum we I invite you now um to those who have joined us tonight to ask any question you feel the need to ask so will anyone like to ask a question at this point if you do just make sure to mute yourself so that we can hear okay um I feel that perhaps um our presentation has been so comprehensive that there are no questions from the community at this point so I'm just going to give you our thanks for attending tonight again I invite you to log online and to go through the online survey or again if you feel uh like having a or getting a more uh private uh forum for to ask your questions feel free to contact us at the strategic planning heritage and

Hi everyone my name is kelly welcome to chair yoga and today's session is joint care and full body circulation to get every part of you energized and feeling good so let's begin let's make sure that we have a chair with a straight back if you can and no arms if possible you're going to place yourself right in the center of the chair so not so much right back but I want you to scoot your bottom forward so you've got a little bit of space behind you and you can place your feet flat on the floor if this isn't going to work for you then grab a nice big dictionary or a couple of books and have your feet resting on them so let's begin so we're in our comfortable position so just take a moment to feel your feet on the ground or on your books and notice how you're feeling sitting up take a nice deep breath in through your nose and breathe out through the mouth take another two big breaths in just energizing out let's do one more and exhale okay so we're going to lean back into the chair and just notice how that feels slouching back here and then we'll pick ourselves up and sit up nice and tall and then again slouching yourself back into the chair and then lifting yourself up nice and tall and just have a couple of rounds of moving back and moving forward noticing how that feels whether there's any tension in your body and let's incorporate the breath with this so we're going to breathe out as we lean back and let go of the shoulders and then inhale lifting ourselves nice and tall lifting up the heart lifting up through the solar plexus and up into the waist we want to make ourselves nice and tall up through the crown of the head and then let it all go into the back of the chair two more breathing in lifting up tall breathe out let it go and another one and let it go beautiful let's come up to the nice tall long position bring our for your shoulders we're going to lift the arms all the way up maybe they don't come up all the way maybe they stop here that's absolutely perfect and then you're going to join us in the heart prayer which are in front of the chest so we're breathing in and breathing out as we come down the center line again good breath in let's gaze up to our fingers exhale and another big breath in a nice big reminder to lengthen through that spine lift up and breathe out we're gonna stop here in front of the heart elbows in line with wrists in line with your heart shoulders are dropped and we slide the elbows over to one side press your opposite hand into your palm so we get this stretch through the elbow maybe to the little finger or on a railway track inhale back slide to the other side now we're not going behind take it straight to the side of the room and come back and breathing out I love this stretch it's a beautiful one for circulating oxygen and blood through the body and we're just going to give these meridian lines that connect into the lungs and the heart just a little bit of love breathing back breathe out to the side inhale and exhale and let's come back to center we're going to take one hand out so lengthen out one arm doesn't matter which one we're going to do both so we're pressing the heel of the hand away shoulder height and we pull the other elbow back it's like we're holding onto a bow and we're pulling back the string if your neck allows you're going to gaze down to that top middle finger the top of that middle finger down the arm looking at the tip of the finger and really pull that opposite elbow back so you're pulling on that strings wonderful tai chi moo for the lungs let's fill up into the lungs into the chest breathe it all out let's switch sides hands come back to the prayer position and then stretch your other into the bow position push and both hands both sets of fingers are pointing straight up to the ceiling shoulders are relaxed still sitting up nice and tall breathe in breathe out and you know you're doing it correctly you'll feel that stretch in the arms it's a very gentle stretch you're not forcing it relax and lengthen imagine your arm or your hand is traveling across the room putting your hand print on the wall and then we're going to come back to center hands come back to our prayer position and let's take our arms down for a moment rotate the wrists in one direction and then the other direction and we'll take some nice big shoulder rolls so we'll breathe in squeeze the shoulders up to the ears breathe out take them down inhale lift them up exhale take them down back one more ah beautiful if your arms allow it we're reaching up to the ceiling if they don't below their shoulders is absolutely fine we're doing a sky sway so we're twisting gently soft fingers are soft and we're just gently twisting from one side to the other side and I'm not going to think more like you're swaying and you're gazing up to the sky ah breathe in breathe out one we're going for six two three explaining the breeze four five and six come back and relax the arms all the way down let's go for a nice big shoulder roll again breathe in exhale and again ah one more ah beautiful so slouch back into your chair this is our rest pose just let it all go and we'll pick up one foot and we'll rotate now you might not be able to pick up your foot that's fine put your feet on the toes on the floor and we can rotate into the ankle this way and then change direction when you're ready or maybe your legs out straight and you can rotate the ankle one way and then the other way maybe you can do two completely up to you at the same time if not put the and then the other way you're noticing if there's any restriction cracking or creaking we're just paying attention to how our ankles feel today change direction and then we'll bring both feet flat to the floor again nice and flat okay let's bring our attention back to our hands and wrists we're going to uh keep them out and open we're going to close the fists up and see if you can squeeze you know pretty tightly imagine you're holding on to a rope and then you're going to open up the hands and spread them as wide as you can and again we're squeezing and we're opening and it's okay to rest your hands on your lap and do this as well you don't have to have them in the same position as me if you like if you like having your arms up you can stretch them above your head but just pick whichever one feels best for your shoulders so today I'm going to do my on my legs and I'm squeezing out inhale squeeze and breathe out and really spread the fingers try to get the webbing in between each finger to stretch let's do three or four more and then we're going to do a touching so we're going to bring our thumb to our index fingers then we're going to move them to the middle finger so thumb and middle finger then thumb index finger some little finger thumb ring finger thumb and middle finger thumb and the index finger and then we're going to go back middle ring little little finger ring finger middle finger index index finger middle finger ring little finger little finger ring middle finger and index finger and see if you can keep going we were doing the double tap on the index finger and the pinky fingers the little fingers see how fast you can go some days will be good some days maybe not so good it's about trying we want to keep going and it might be easier for you to do one hand at a time do one round and then go to the your shoulders nice and relaxed we'll do one more round then we'll give it a rest for a moment can we slouch back into the chair ah just have a little rest nice big sigh I was always good to let go of any health tension ah one more so one more little routine for the fingers we're going to bring our index finger to the tip of your thumb slide the index finger to the base of your thumb and then it's the middle finger that starts at the top of the thumb and slides down to the base of the thumb so we're feeling each finger start at the top of the thumb and slowly drag or slide all the way down if you can to the base of the thumb and we finish with the little finger or maybe a little bit more trickier and then we'll go to the other side so index finger sliding down to the base of the thumb the middle finger sliding down to the base of the thumb ring finger and then little finger let and again it's not about doing it exactly right it's trying with breath with a smile and feeling and noticing because the more you practice these the better circulation you'll get and it'll become easier so notice how it felt today notice how it feels again next week okay so we're resting our hands back in our lap again and now we're taking our attention down to our feet so hopefully you've got no shoes on because I want you to see your toes you're going to pick your toes up off the floor and then press them down into the ground again we're lifting them up and pressing them down it's always a nice idea to watch your own feet and just notice maybe one foot is lifting more than the other or the big toes are lifting more than the other or maybe it's the little toes that are freer than the others so again we're just noticing and we're inhaling when our feet are on the floor and then we breathe out as we up a couple more and if you can't see your feet it's absolutely fine I want you to imagine them now we're going to lift our heels so press the toes into the floor lift the heels up and press them down and lift them up press them down again lift them up and press them down and maybe we can begin to walk on the spot shoulders are relaxed and just enjoy this walking motion on your chair and rocking so the walls of the feet heels balls of the feet pressed down in the heels and we're rocking our body forward and we're rocking our body back toes and heels toes and and softening relax beautiful so we're going to go into a traditional chair uh posture called warrior two and if we can we're going to take our leg doesn't matter which one because we're going to do both out to the side so one knee is pointing forward the other knee is pointing out to the side if you can't get into this position it's as far as it can go or maybe just the foot steps to the side whatever works for you today we take our arms out lengthen them out we're doing a little twist rolling the shoulders forward and then rolling them back so you may notice that my palms are also turned try not to just do the hands roll from the shoulders forward roll from the shoulders back we breathe in and we breathe out roll forward we're breathing we breathe out roll them back inhale and we're also lengthening through the fingers imagining that we're brushing the sides of the room with our fingertips one and two and three and four five last one and six ah let's float the arms down come back into position ah slump back into your chair reverse posing the arms are just hanging or resting and allow that circulation to move through the shoulder all those muscles in the shoulders the joints I always like to sigh it's a beautiful way of letting go let's come on up into our nice tall starting position and extend the arms reaching to touch the side walls breathe in breathe out roll forward breathing back breathe out and you might go you might like to go slower than me that's fine find your own pace but stay with the flow of your breath we'll do six one two three four five and six and let's float the arms down feet come back to position slump into your chair breathe in ah one more ah hands are on your mat let's come up to a nice tall position again we'll go for a little chair twist so one hand reaches behind takes hold of your chair or maybe underneath the chair if you um if that's more comfortable for you so what we're doing here is our hand we'll go across to our opposite leg we're breathing in and as we brew that we're twisting around towards our hands keeping the spine as tall as we can imagining that there's a string lifting us straight up towards the ceiling holding and breathing into this beautiful twist it's your exhale twist if you go back in the shoulders are soft the heart is lifting up and release come back to your center position take a deep breath in slump back into your chair and let it go let's do the other side through reaching around bring that twist towards the hands gazing over your shoulder comfortable breaths if it's not comfortable back out and soften out just a little way and if you'd like to challenge a little bit more of course twist a lift one more breath and let's release take a breath in and relax and slump back into your chair roll down and take a big inhale again nice long exhale sitting up tall making your hands into cups so there's some air that's going to happen in in your palms we're going to start to cut our chest keep your breathing smooth and even into the top of the chest around your pectoral muscle down the center line into your ribs into the sides if you can reach back up the center line maybe using pecking traveling all over the upper chest area then going down the sides sliding your hands or maybe one hand at a time into your lower back you can feel your lower back under your hands the warmth of your hands again it might be one hand that you're going to do at a time wherever you are close your eyes or pick a point on the floor your breathing is slow and even feeling the hands supporting your lower back and directing your breath towards those hands this area we regard as the kidney area we want to try and get our breath that long inhale all the way down to our knees to the hands into the lumbar the lower back those muscles one more breath let's bring our hands all the way back to our lap turn the palms up still sitting nice and tall just noticing how that feels having the air moving into the palms of your hands holding two big balls of the air in your hands feeling your feet flat on the surface area underneath you shoulders soft face is relaxed sitting to lean back ever so slightly into those symbols your core will gently switch on in your belly take one more breath together slide your arms down by the sides of your body breathing in let's bring the arms up press the palms together come into your prayer mudra with the hands in front of the heart bow your head thank you for practicing joint care and circulation yoga with me today practice as much as you can for maximum benefit thank you

ah okay hands to the chest and we'll take one arm back we so you're flexing your hand and you're pushing the heel away as you do a little twist through the torso and look behind you breathing in come back and again other side so we pull the fingers right back towards the body so we're really flexing that wrist and lengthening the arm away so we get a nice nerve stretch through the arm twist through the body and take it around as far as you can without causing any discomfort breathing in coming back so we're opening up the heart area chest we're giving the body a nice little squeeze out

ribs start to separate the waist is opening reach through the fingers just a little bit more take one more breath and let's release just before we go over to the other side sink back into your rest pose into your chair and let your arms fall or rest them on your lap close your eyes and check in how does one side of your body feel does it feel a little bit more open or a little bit more relaxed yoga creates this inner awareness inner awareness of how our body's feeling it's these subtle changes that we make in our body that have a knock-on effect for how we feel in our heart and in our minds okay let's go on to the other side so come on up make a fist plant your hips and sitting bones into the floor feet are stable place that fist up as high as you can aiming it towards the armpit and breathe in and breathe out take it over reach through the fingertips anchor that opposite hip to the ear if you can breathing in coming back and breathing out going over to the side again breathe out breathe out reach through the fingers try to separate all those ribs breathing in come back one more nice and slow breathe it out head and neck is relaxed no tension there inhale back and let's go for six one big inhale then a big exhale two three four five last one six and we hold it this is your chance to lengthen and feel the stretch push the opposite hip down so you don't topple keep breathing open the chest up a little gaze up towards the ceiling if your neck allows reach through the fingers a little bit more take a big breath in and let's release let the arms go sink back into rest pose flop the arms close your eyes let it all settle breathe so it's interesting when we feel stress we usually find that the sides of our body get really tight right through the ribs the sides of the head that can create headaches when the sides and can get bloating and pain after you eat it also tightens into the sides of the hips and into the glutes and we can get hip pain especially if there's some lower back weakness so as we open up the sides of the body we find that our whole body then begins to let go and it's very difficult for us to stay really stressed in the mind and the heart when the body is soft and open so let's release into the back a little bit the muscles in the back hold our emotions and we want to try and release that a little bit releases in letting it go getting it out those tight muscles getting circulation and blood flowing so I'll show you what it looks like from the side we're gently rolling and arching through the back and pushing the chest forward so as I roll back I'm imagining that my tailbone is getting closer to the chair and then tucking it under and then as I come up under my sitting bones I'm pushing the chest forward just movement of flexing the spine one way and then the other way have a go when you're ready and we're breathing in as we push the chest forward and we're breathing out as we roll back we're inhaling up and we can lift the chin up a little bit and then we can exhale pull the chin into the throat a little bit and you're just going to go at your own pace inhaling and exhaling breathing in and breathing out and you can go as fast or as slow as you like I'm going to aim for about six more enjoy the front and back working together front of the body we look at receiving the back of the body is our support we want the openness of the front body we want the strength but also the relaxation or the softening of muscles and let's come to a central position if that was okay for you and you want to continue this position then go ahead keep going if you want to add a little bit more to this we're back into fists we press the little finger sides of the hands and the forearms and the elbows really push them together so we're using the strength of our arms here but it's also opening up the shoulders as we curl forward we're breathing out and as we open the arms we're going to breathe in we're bringing them to cactus we pull the arms all the way back and again the chest pushes forward like it did before and then as we breathe out we're curling and we're squeezing the arms pressing those elbows together the little fingers together and then breathing in opening up and that's a beautiful opening of the arms if it's too much for you go back into hands on the lap and flexing the spine one way and then the other so let's do six let's breathe out all the breath here curling forward breathing in open and exhale curling under that's two inhale three and enjoy that breath coming in exhale four five and six come back to center relax the back down forward up back down and one more lovely and release okay our next one's going to use some core strength you can either place your hands on your lap or you can hold on to the sides of your chair we're lifting up a knee and we're placing it on the back and we're lifting up the other knee and we're placing it on the ground and as we do this I want us to start to stomp our feet on the ground I want you to hear or feel or the vibration and feel the ground under your feet as you stop at the same time I want you to be able to lift up your heart just a couple more big sumo steps this is accessing all the points in the base of your foot it's helping to ground the body and hopefully you have kicked off your shoes it's always fabulous to do yoga with no shoes on a couple more chest up breathe and relax sink back into your chair for a moment feel really really good and you can just inhale and exhale let it go inhale exhale let it go it's a great one just like a child stomps their foot when they're having attention maybe not just children maybe all of us need to stamp our foot feet a bit to let go of tension that's held in the body we want to let it out let it go in a healthy way so just soften here closing your eyes down and taking some nice deep breaths into the body and notice how you're feeling now where are you feeling you know maybe some tingling or some circulation where the blood's flowing now maybe you can take in a much deeper breath don't worry if you can't because we're going to do a couple more to open up any tension in the back in the next movement or two okay so when you're ready come on up and sit nice and tall into your chair so we've done warrior one and two in the other videos but I'm going so warrior one we're going to turn our whole body around to one side it doesn't matter which side you can just pick whichever side feels right for you you can use the back of your chair for support while you get comfortable in this position the outside leg goes uh down the side of your the front of your chair so we can dig the toes under we want to make sure that our knee is directly under the hip if we can and the other foot is nice and flat on the ground so it might mean that you need to just move yourself around and get nice and stable on your chair so when you're stable and you can let go of your hand you we're going to bring our arms into eagle arms so we take the outside arm underneath and cross our arms around now this is uh not accessible to you just the backs of the palms are good the backs of the hands together is perfect we want to try and bring the elbows close but if they're're at so we're going to take a nice big breath in as we lift the hands up and the elbows away and we might gently come back just gazing up as far as we can no need to push and then as we breathe out we're curling under so you might see that this is another spinal flex just like we did before and the arms give it just a little bit more opening a little bit more release if we've got some upper body tension that creates tension in the head the mind and the heart let's keep moving we're breathing out as we go undone down inhale as we come up we're going to move for three more making sure that your feet are nice and stable we're using the chair for support but we wanted to try and access those muscles in the legs so try to use your feet to press them down into the ground we're going to go one more we're gonna hold up here for a couple of breaths and then we'll sink back into our chair for a little rest pose first let your arms hang close your eyes let your chin move into the throat so the back of the neck is stretching ah sighing is perfect keep breathing out until all the breath is gone and when you're ready take a nice big breath in as we come up and we'll do the other side so we turn our body all the way around the other side of the room hold on to your chair get yourself settled into warrior one hosed up under knee directly under your hip or as close as not available and we're going to cross the outside arm underneath or we're going to bring the backs of the palms together and the elbows nice and close so we're breathing in as we lift up moving the elbows away exhale curl under breathing in and breathing out moving at your pace flexing the spine one way and then exhaling the other way engaging the feet into the floor aiming for three more and on our last one we're enjoy gently pressing the chest forward and let's release relax everything back into your chair ah let it all go let your arms hang take them for a little walk if they need feed a couple of stomps on the ground to let go of any tightness that you might feel there from having your toes flexed and take another deep breath before we move into warrior two and so nice and high up on your chair and take one knee straight out to the side only take it out as far as it can that it's comfortable for you and again adjust yourself on the chair so both sitting bones are on the the chair itself no bottoms hanging off at all just knee out to the side we're going to go for a nice little twist take both hands to the outside knee take a big breath in as we lengthen through the spine and breathe out use your hands or hand to just pull you around look towards the back of the room gaze away as far off into the distance as you can twist come back to center and switch sides so we'll take the other knee out get stable on your chair both hands go to the outside knee breathe in and breathe out twist breathe in then lengthen breathe out and twist and remember to take your eyes around as far as you can you really want to get the muscles in the eyes to stretch and twisting is a fabulous way of releasing deeply held tension not only through the body but in the eyes as well we get really stressed you might find that your eyesight changes okay then we come back breathing in both feet back to the floor again coming up nice and tall with your spine hands to the heart we're going to take three breaths as we lift the chest towards the hands and gaze up your chin just lifts ever so slightly and as you breathe in feel your chest lifting and expanding up towards your hands a little bit more as you breathe out soften your shoulders another breath in feel the chest expanding into your hands and breathe out relax in to the hands breathe out shoulders relaxed chin moves in towards the throat we take one hand across the body and around to your ribs the other hand is going to go up and over the top of the head and takes the side of your head we take the ear down towards your shoulder so your hand is getting closer towards the ceiling and we're turning our body into a little c shape we're gazing up towards the opposite corner of the room and we're going to hold here and breathe so we're just gently pulling our ribs in towards the body with our hand and we're going to hold our eyes at stretching those eye muscles to the top corner of the room and this stretch is a vagus nerve stretch the vagus nerve is very much connected well it's a nervous system stretch and it helps us relax into rest and digest I'm just going to hold for a few more moments it's a very big nerve runs right through the body and it's a very calming into your chair for two breaths notice the sides of your body breathe into any space that you created the openings and let's do the other side so opposite hand goes to the other ribs and the other arm goes up and over the head we're drawing the ear just very gently down towards the shoulder so your hand on the side of the head is pointing towards the ceiling we're moving our body into a very gentle little side stretch it's more pulling the ribs in so you're the shape of a c for cat and we're taking our eyes to the opposite corner of the room and we're breathing so at the beginning of the class I said uh that when the sides of the body become tight we get we do we automatically start to become mind tight our breathing restricts we don't get enough of that deep breath happening we become shallow in our breath we're not getting enough oxygen our body naturally thinks this is under stress so we're trying to create a sense sides and releasing this nerve the vagus nerve just a few more moments here breathe softly in and out enjoy the stretch and find when you're more calmer your digestive system works better you sleep better you feel better and communicate better and let's release gently gently and come back into your chair relax everything close your eyes down for a few moments let it all go if it's a new stretch for you for you you might feel as you come out you might be a little bit tight but it's okay we practice and our muscles begin to become flooded with new life energy new qi blood flow and it becomes much easier each time you practice we're going to finish our class today with what's called a yoga breath of excellence and I love this breathing technique because I like it because it can cool the body down in the heat of summer but I also love it because it cools the heart and cools the blood so if you're a little bit hot-headed or you're feeling really tense it's going to calm you down cool you down cool your temper down so I want you to get really comfortable pop some pillows behind you or sit back into your chair we're bringing our hands into a very traditional mudra for yoga it's the index fingers and thumbs come together and resting on your lap we relax the shoulders we just feel the sitting bones into the chair we notice all the contact points of our body resting into the chair and our inhale comes in through the mouth and our exhale out through the nose we make our mouth into an o shape a round o and we're breathing in pull air into the mouth into the lungs and then we close the mouth and we breathe out the warm air through the nose we breathe in through the mouth feeling that cool air hit the tip of the tongue the back of the throat down into the lungs and we breathe out through the nose you keep going at your own pace slow it right down might make you a little thirsty that one more and gently release and come back to a normal breath if that felt good you can keep going for you know up to 10 to 12 rounds of breath of excellence to cool you down a little bit more um and remember it on really hot days as well if you're um feeling it it's a nice one to cool you off okay let's bring our arms down by our sides we'll breathe in we'll press the palms together come to the heart center bow the head thank you for a wonderful practice thank you for joining me I'll see you next time

Hi everyone welcome to chair yoga and today's session is relaxing your back before we begin make sure that you have a chair with the back no arms if possible and make sure that your feet can connect to the ground and if you don't or you can't reach the floor please get a book or a big dictionary and awesome yoga blocks if you have those you can wear anything just as long as you're comfortable okay let's begin position yourself in the middle of your chair so we're not sinking right back into the chair we're standing up nice and tall in our chair sitting up nice and tall in our chair and feeling the crown of the head being lifted up with an imaginary string we lift and lengthen we're also feeling our sitting bones and our feet connecting into the floor let's place one hand down and one hand up and just notice how that feels we can breathe in through the nose and we can breathe out through them it's releasing any tension that we our emotional heart emotional mind anything that may be upsetting or worrying very slowly when you're ready switch your hands so turning one over as the other one meets your leg continue your breathing and in eastern healing modalities we view our back as of course our support but also different areas of the back hold different emotional responses and memories so normally we would look to the back to release emotional tension as well as physical tension keep breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth just noticing how you are feeling sitting on your chair today and slowly move your hands down next to you and we'll sweep them up the sides right up towards the ceiling gazing up to our fingers and reaching up with the right hand and then reaching up a little more with the left hand turn the palms out exhale all the way down with the arms let's do it again big breath in and stretch with one arm so as we lengthen that side our sitting bone on that side presses down so we're getting a other arm up turn the palms out exhale one more big breath in reach and reach can the palms out and this time the breath lifts the arms we press the palms together and we draw everything into our heart center draw the head down to the fingertips and take the next breath into your heart and breathe out we'll place our hands on our knees or on our thighs wherever you can reach and we'll move through our cat cow position moving forward opening the chest breathing and breathing out as we curl under inhale and exhale and how it looks from the side flexing and releasing breathing in breathing out curling and releasing when you come up you're right on top of the sitting bones lifting the heart up as you curl under we're rolling our lower back towards the chair or our tailbone towards the chair we're rounding through the spine shoulders dropped and the chin moves into the foot and feel free to hover in each position for a couple of reps breathing deeply into the back if there's a we'll go the other way feel the front body the chest filling up and as you exhale softening through the shoulders holding and breathing it's important to keep those feet on the ground and also keeping the breath flowing let's do one more holding in each position absolutely do what feels comfortable it should be a nice comfortable stretch if it isn't just back out of it a little bit breathing into all the tight areas that are feeling stretched right now and then moving into your cow position the chest moves forward we're right on top of the sitting bones our chin is lifted just a little way one more breath feel the heart open moving forward and release open out one knee into our warrior two position one knee is pointing forward the other knee out to the side or maybe your knee looks like it might be on a diagonal that's perfect as well just move to where you feel your body can move today both feet still connected to the ground and make sure that you feel very supported that move yourself right into the center we're taking one hand behind the head and the other hand back of the palm your lower back now if this doesn't feel comfortable for you at all feel free to cross the arms over your chest we take a breath in and we breathe out pull the elbows back opening up the chest a little more and inhale and then breathe out move towards that outstretched knee keeping the chest open towards the ceiling breathing in coming back breathing out squeezing into the waist squeezing into this waist area feet are very much stable inhale come up we're going to move with our breath for five more one two three move slower if you need four last one and one hold that five squeeze into the waist if your neck allows goes up to the ceiling if not you can look down to the floor or look straight ahead pull those elbows back take another breath and release come all the way back release the arms roll the shoulders a couple of times we're going to move straight into knee out to the side anyway we're going to turn our whole body to face that side of the room and take the other foot back so you can have a flexed foot or a pointed toe whatever feels best for you we're also making sure that we're directing our knees straight down to the floor and again you're shuffling yourself your weight on your chair you can hold on to the chair if you need some support and allow yourself to uh connect with that the ground underneath your feet okay so we're taking our arms into a prayer position with the elbows open today curling under we're just dropping ourselves forward I want us to breathe into the upper back and when we breathe out we're gently opening the chest up towards the ceiling breathing in and breathing out and I particularly love this one because we are required to use our core muscles when our core muscles are working and getting strong it means that other parts of our body can relax and just be supported by those core stable breathing out coming up now feel free to stay in whatever position and breathe a couple of breaths softening into the shape and then you can allow your body to come forward and coming up to center and all the way back to the middle keep the knees nice and wide and open and allow yourself to rest into those knees drop your shoulders and leaning forward holding here and breathing for one more breath bringing the knees to touch we'll take our other knee out to the side or as far as you can adjust yourself on your chair making sure that you are stable feet are connected the back of the body needs to feel safe and supported so it is important that you just take a little bit of time to make sure that you are completely rested and square on your chair okay all right so we'll take the other hand behind the head now and take a breath in pull the elbows back and exhale down to the side and I want you to really focus on squeezing into the waist not so nice little squeeze as we pull those elbows back gaze up towards the ceiling go nice and slowly here breathing in coming back take your time breathing out connect your feet all four corners of them on the floor down if your neck doesn't like looking up another nice slow one continue slow or you can move through five more one squeeze into that waist two three four last one and we'll hold we'll gently open the chest to the ceiling pull that top elbow back feel your sitting bones on the chair and your feet on the ground and release come all the way back relax your arms breathe in do a little shoulder stroke if you need moving now into our warrior one take your time to set yourself up our back needs to feel safe that the ground isn't going to sweep out from underneath us so go super slow knee underneath your hip or as best as you can adjust on the chair so you're stable bring your hands together elbows open we're inhaling here exhale come on down let out lifting up inhaling and exhaling and notice your weight isn't shifting between the front foot and the back foot see if you can have both feet pressing into the floor evenly and whenever you feel like you can hold a position and take a few breaths here relaxing into the shape and then moving into the counter position and breathing life into the muscles of being stretched and activated and when you're ready come on back move yourself back to the center feet and knees to wide hands on the knees or the thighs leaning forward maybe this time you can take it a little further maybe the elbows but it doesn't matter if you can't get down to those elbows the hands are great soft upper back and shoulders and here we gently pull the chin down towards the throat so the back of the neck is stretching and right up underneath the skull the occipital area where we hold a lot of tension up underneath here when you've got cheating and we hold this tightness let's gently open it out get do some spinal rolls so adjust your body so your feet are hip distance apart and of course you can adjust your legs and feet to um suit your body we're doing some spinal rolls and we're going to go nice and slowly so what it looks like from the side is head comes down chin into the throat first then roll the shoulders forward and you're curling imagine your spine curling vertebrae by the rail section by section and you're going to come down of course you can use your hands to help you and you're coming down as far as you can without toppling so have your feet flat and your belly active and you're going to come down as far as you can take a couple of breaths wherever you land it might be up here and then roll up exactly the same way as you went down okay the last thing to bring up okay so we do it two more times together the slower the better so breathe in head neck shoulders upper back mid back lower back maybe in your lower back breathe in breathe out get a soft shake yes yes rolling up engage the belly push the sitting bones into your chair slowly stacking each bit by each bit take a breath when you're up here maybe your shoulder roll on the thigh ah and we'll go down for one more so notice maybe skipping an area or one area might just feel really tired or painful feel free to stop there wherever it is and take a couple of breaths here and just kind of say hello to that part of you that's saying hi I'm really tight and I'm getting some attention so hold them and give it some attention take your breath to that area fill it up breathe it out soften and then continue maybe the next spot the next spot in the next spot take your time to stop and breathe into those sore tight areas and when you get down towards the floor you can feel free if it feels okay to nod your head yes gentle shape no engage the lower body as you any areas that you missed and then we'll come up and I want you to completely just lean back slouch into your chair in rest pose well done and we're just gonna relax here for a moment taking some nice big deep breaths in relaxing the belly the back and holding holding still wobbly okay so coming up into our tall position again feet flat on the floor and we're not going to uh completely get off the chair but it's a feeling of we're about to so about to sit up and it could be just those sitting bones lift you might be able to feel your bones slightly left but your your fleshy bits of your back of your legs and your bottom doesn't lift but it feels like we're going to so we press our hair off sorry our feet into the floor and we're about to sing and then we come back and breathe out about to sit up and breathe in come back and just go at your own pace and notice if one side is leading the same time are you tensing in your shoulders we want to relax all of that chin soft in towards the throat make sure you're breathing nice and slowly you can do it slowly you can do it a little bit quicker do what feels right for you maybe two more remember we're not getting all the way up we're just attempting evenly without tension in the upper body let's do one more slump back good job you can give your arms a little swing and relax here palms up palms down one up one down it doesn't matter as long as you are relaxed and closed eyes pick a point on the floor and soften into inner awareness floating your attention around your body how am I feeling now after doing a few movements to release tension and emotional holying in the back how does it feel now we'll take a breath and we'll slowly lead with the head spine roll up to a seated position okay sitting nice and tall and there's going to be varying abilities with this one you so again you're positioning your bottom in the center section of your chair you are quite welcome to hold on to the chair for more support as we push our heel away so we're trying to straighten our leg here and we're pulling the toes all all five of them back towards the face now even the little toe side of your foot I want you to peel it back so your ankle is flexed evenly and point the toe and flex the toe we're always lifting through the chest inhale point the toe exhale flex the toes and keep going at your own pace it can be slow or fast but really make sure that the little toe is pulling back just as much as the big toe now in chinese medicine we're looking at meridians energy lines through the body and by flexing in this way we're accessing the bladder channel and when we talk about the bladder channel I'm not talking about your organ of your bladder that sits in your body talking about the bladder line it runs leg through and up either side of the back over the top of the head to the middle of the eyes or the inside corners of the eyes and we're accessing our hamstring muscles and really helping the back by activating energy flow through this bladder channel and when you've had enough of that one we're going to put that on the floor and we'll start with the other foot and pointing and flexing really pulling the little toes back remember not to slouch keep lifting up nice and high breathing in and point breathe out flex and if you're having trouble keeping your leg up in the air feel free to have it on the floor point and then flex it you'll be going a little bit smaller still the same thing applies little toes pull back just a couple more and then both feet to the floor our next movement we pick up our foot and we place it on our thigh okay so this might not work for a lot of you in that case we will go back to warrior it could be on a diagonal out to the side or maybe just the knee drops out this is absolutely fine but for those of you that can get the foot up onto your leg we're going to flex the foot and gently open the knee out and we'll go for a little spinal twist so we're going to lift up the chest take your opposite hand to your knee breathe in lift and breathe out twist around holding on to the chair keep breathing lifting and make lengthening and come back to center and leaning forward you can use your elbows your hands if you're in this position leaning forward this position leaning forward this position leaning forward two more breaths soften through your hips your chin is poked in towards your chest so the back of the neck is open and long and let's release let's go to the other side flexing your foot take a breath other hand opposite hand to the knee other hand on your chin long tall spine breathe out twist keep breathing enjoying clearing out the cobwebs out tension from the muscles and you can come back center and folding forward ah chin tucks in and we're still opening up the energy lines of the bladder channel our support our stability our grounding our tree roots take another breath and then we're going to roll up undo your legs or bring your knees back to uh front position opening out the knees we're going to walk down so it's another spinal roll but we're really just going to try and stop when we've got our armpits in our knees your armpits might be nowhere near your knees they might be elbows on the knees or hands on the knees or bent elbows near the knees wherever you get is fabulous and breathe in breathe out drop the head pull the chin into the throat and while you're here take really deep breaths into the back of the body right around the shoulders the upper back the middle back the lower back keep checking the head soft and then use your hands walk yourself like an elephant all the way back come up we're gonna go back down again two more times walk yourself down check your heads relaxed breathe into the back of the body and then we start to squeeze and walk all the way up our legs I'm gonna do it one more time walking back down head check shoulders check upper back breathe knee back breathe lower back breathe and they walk squeezing each place that you're gripping come all the way back and I want you to slump back in your chair ah good stuff all right it takes a lot of effort to let go of tension especially from our back we hold so much we walk around with so much past and future worries on our shoulders on our back and it's a great practice to keep relaxing and releasing those muscles to let go of any of those past memories or future concerns so we can live very freely in the present right now there is no problem right now take a big breath in breathe out wonderful when you're ready we're just going to finish with sacrum so flat hands you're going to well you can do one hand if it's difficult to get two hands around just warming up that lower back area and like you're making a fire you can do two but one's fine and you're rubbing into that beautiful kidney diagnostic area warming them up lots of courage it's where our fear is kept or held and we want to just kind of warm that up and get some blood flowing in this area keep rubbing down into the sacrum that's that bony plate and this area is governed by the bladder channel and this is where we can feel very safe and supported so let's bring some warmth here lovely and then we're going to rub into the hips around the sacrum around the back of the hips and then relax the arms and just take the arms for a bit of a walk bit of a shake out take a good breath ah breathe it out beautiful we're going to do four rounds of four squared breath the four squared really great if you want to try and fall asleep at night and uh it's a very easy one so we're counting for the count of four to breathe in we're holding our breath for four we're breathing out for four and we're holding all the breath out for four so everything's four I'll count you through so close your eyes feel free to sit back into your chair and get really comfortable if you want to just relax everything and take a big inhale for the count of one two three four hold the breath one two three four exhale one two three four hold all

Welcome everyone my name is kelly and thank you for joining me for chair yoga today our session today is all about positive knowledge and uh before we begin I want you to make sure that you've got a chair with the back and preferably a chair with no armrests and your feet should be able to touch the floor so we scoot our cells up to the middle section of our chair so we can stand nice and tall and just take a moment to feel yourself slumping back into the chair and then lifting and lengthening and see how that feels so just doing that a couple of times just feeling yourself full back into the chair and lifting up nice and tall and again dropping back and sitting up nice and tall let's stay here and if at any time anything feels uncomfortable for you just slow it down or find a resting position which is our slumping and join back in when you're ready okay so we'll start by bringing one hand to the chest and one hand to the belly and belly button you can close your eyes down here or just pick a point on the floor and focus on that area and we're taking our breath into these two areas so as you breathe in through the nose you're feeling that hand on your lower belly expand and keep breathing in until the hand on your upper chest also expands and then as you breathe out the chest relaxes and your belly gently draws in towards the spine these are very small movements and even if you find that you can't get expansion or feeling that area rise and fall that's okay just feel the pressure of your hands and as you inhale imagine that your breath is going to both these hands and we're filling up from the bottom hand right up to the top hand we're breathing out through the mouth letting the shoulders drop two more rounds and through the nose and out through the mouth when you're ready take your arms down by your sides and breathe in and lift the arms all the way up towards the center line up your elbows to your wrists and to your shoulders and everything's relaxed lifting up tall breathe in and just move your head down into a bowel so you're looking downward take an inhale and a long exhale a little pressure with the hand the little fingers and the middle fingers or fingers actually but those two in particular the little finger your pinkies and your long middle fingers pressing together relax the shoulders one more breath and release we're going to use our fingertips to tap all over the head we're searching for areas that feel tight and sore and achy we're going to tap at the top of the head and the back of the head around the base of the skull and again looking for areas that are tight and sore keep going back to those areas keep breathing in and out we hold a lot of tension in the sides of our head when we're holding a lot in our heart and our minds so we're going to tap and get some circulation through those energy lines to go on to the top of the head and I love these pressure points up here they're beautiful for and very effective for giving you some energy and helping to lift your spirits light taps we're going to go across the forage and imagining that you're just smoothing out a thorough brow you can use your fingers to smooth or you can tap if you like that feeling better you can tap into the temples or you can do small little circles whatever feels good for you today some days it'll be more tap some days more soothing and light finger taps across the jaw also the cheekbones and then into the jaw and then along the jaw we're going to pinch so fingers over the chin and the thumbs underneath and we just pinch along our jaw do that a couple of times pinching pinching and squeezing out and pinching out any tightness that we're holding in our face we're going to bring our hands into this position so two index fingers and middle fingers ring finger and middle finger together so two at the back and two at the front and we're rubbing bringing some warts here and then we'll relax down we'll take a big breath in fingertips again hold the breath hold your breath in as we tap across the chest and down your center line and right up right up at the top of the chest where the collar bones almost meet there's a gap just into that sternum area of the breastbone hold the breath as long as you can and then when you can't hold the breath anymore we'll just breathe out drop the chin into the throat roll your shoulders up towards your ears exhale roll them back and again big breath in and long breath out fingertips of moving towards the shoulders so our thumb is at the back the fingertips are at the front and we're rotating our shoulders by imagining we're drawing two circles on either side of the room with our elbows and we're breathing in up and we're breathing out down inhale exhale one and two three four five and five of course you can do it slower or faster it's all up to you we're going to take our arms all the way up and this movement is called flying let's uh hold on to our fingers or our thumbs we're going to do 10 we breathe in and as we breathe out we're dropping our arms down by our sides and if your chair comes out further then just be mindful when you bring your arms down by your sides yeah you can try opening up the legs a little bit more so you hit the sides of your legs this is always good okay and we're hitting the insides of our wrists onto our legs to stimulate really nice heart points that directly help to uplift your mood so breathing in taking hold of your hands or your fingers or your thumb exhale drop and inhale and exhale drop and if this is uncomfortable for you to lift your arms up in this way imagine yourself doing it as you lift your arms to shoulder height then breathe out drop going to go for 10. breathe in and exhale one two three four let them drop five let your breath carry your arms up six shoulders drop seven eight nine and ten palms up on your lap close your eyes you can slump into your chair for a rest pose if you like let's take some deep breaths and flying with the arms helps to invigorate your lungs giving you hope and optimism the lungs and the heart work together and we open the chest uh to allow for a lightness to come to the mind and to the emotions take one more breath here and let it all go we'll come up to a comfortable seated position so making sure that your feet are flat on the ground with this one and we're going to start to lose wrists and we're going to start punching and I want those feet nice and flat to the ground so you feel stable and you're not going to fall off your chair because it's not just a little punch I want you to kind of let punch to the sides and just allow your body to do a little kind of follow through as well and you're breathing out inhale and exhale of course you can go slower but imagine yourself really punching away yeah and allowing things to soften not holding tight let it go just a few more keep those arms moving for the lungs and then slump back in your chair let it all go and just feel the flow of chi and energy and blood down the arms soften into your chair ah a couple of nice big size is always a great way to release anything that we're holding onto ah one more ah and come on up nice and tall in your chair again rotate the wrist in one direction and the other direction and just having a look at my hands I'm going to do three part curls so it's straight this is one part making claw fingers which is half a half a fist and then a nice tight fist and then an open claw fist and you can do this resting your hands them out but we want to keep moving through each of these movements extend half a claw and fists and fists relax the shoulders and watching your hands if it's easier for you to do one hand at a time please do we're going to go for a few more if you have an injury with one hand and you can't do both you just do the one that works and notice your fingers working together when our mind is really active or worried or going over the same things all the time we tend to fidget or we eat or we may smoke or pick scratch we do things with our fingers and in chinese medicine we look at the fingertips as very connected to how our mind is working so we can soothe the mind by working the fingers working the hands the heart is all also connected through our hands it's how we express how we communicate with others just a couple more and then let's shake it up a couple of nice big shoulder rolls release release release now we're side of our wrist and you're going to find the area that might feel a bit sore and it might take some exploring but we're massaging in a circle we're finding those ribs and finding any area that feels a little tight or sore and using our heels of our hands to massage nice big circles and I love these pressure points here they help to soothe uh tightness in our sides and if stress is there it will affect our digestion and these are great points to help to release we're going to breathe in and breathe out as we massage those areas that might feel a little sore or tender and then we'll relax the arms down so we're moving into this side stretch a little more we'll come into warrior two so one knee goes out to the side both feet are planted on the floor so scoot your bottom a little bit closer up to the edge of your chair not too much we don't want to tip and we'll go for a nice little side stretch to the side you're going to take your arms up and take hold of your left wrist we're breathing in and breathing out as we open up the side of the body holding here and opening the chest up towards the ceiling we're just going to pull on that wrist a little more now if this is not available to you please cross your arms over your chest and still opening up the sides of the ribs is perfect we'll take two more breaths here planting those feet down don't let them lift and we're going to release and relax and we're going to just drop back into our chair and rest pose ah it's always good to open up the sides of our body letting tension just drain out of our whole system our mind our heart our body when you're ready come on up to a tall seat again we'll take the other knee out to the side and plant your feet down take the arms up we'll take hold of our other wrist now and we opening up that side of the body deep breaths and see if we can get that breath down low into the belly and up into the chest as well ah enjoying chest openings to the ceiling a little bit more if you can one more breath ah come on out and go back into your rest pose back into your chair let it all settle close your eyes just feel that softness and lightness that comes from releasing tightly held sides of the body and take one more breath and gently rolling yourself up to sit we're going to do a spinal roll always nice to release tension in the back of the body so we shuffle ourselves forward if your feet are not touching the floor remember you can always use books to old yoga blocks for your feet and we inhale exhale head comes down then shoulders and the mid back lower back come down as far as you can without tipping over even if you get halfway and you're resting on your thighs it's absolutely fabulous letting yourself go here just breathing into the relaxed breathing in pressing your feet down into the floor as we roll up just the way we came down so section by section lower back middle back shoulders and your head do it one more time breathe in breathe out head shoulders back mid back lower back sacrum stretch check your head and let's inhale and then exhale rolling rolling and come back and again sink back into your chair well done take a couple of nice big deep breaths here and soften relax feel the chair underneath you and as you breathe down into that lower belly and up into the chest notice if there's any part of this area that's feeling tight and held see if you can actively relax those muscles relax into that solar plexus area the upper epic the empty gastric area just around those ribs just relax them relax those muscles relax the ribs let go of your belly you're completely sinking into your chair and taking a breath and when you're ready slowly rolling yourself back up into a nice tall seated position placing your hands on lifting up the chest relaxing the shoulders and as you inhale I just want you to bring your face to the ceiling and on your breath out bring your chin into your throat now your hands here on your chest are going to help guide you so the chest always stays up it doesn't curve forward and closing off the lungs we want to keep the chest nice and free and open circulating oxygen lots of room for expansion breathing in and breathing out bending at the neck the chin moves into the thread a couple more last one down the center line that breath travels and then breathing out shoulders relax and drop take your hands around see if you can take hold of your wrists so you've got a monkey grip and if you can't grab hold of your forearms you can just take hold of your hands gently pulling the elbows back we're going to take our feet or our legs for a walk so we're lifting one heel and then the other heel and we're breathing out and in and pulling those elbows back as you walk nice walking breathing one and two three four five six seven and eight come back flat feet to the floor let it go and we'll move straight into our lion pose lion pose is practiced in yoga to open up that heart to let go of anything that's stuck and held in our stomach that's really churning for us and it's a great way of opening up that energy of lightness so I'll show you I'll demonstrate there's a few moving parts in this one and it doesn't really matter if you don't get all of them as long as your tongue sticks out as far as you can get it and you take a really big deep breath out long breath out you're doing fabulous okay so it looks a little bit funny but that's okay we're gonna have a go we inhale and imagine that there's a big super ladle coming down with that breath to scoop up any worries that you have anything that's bugging you to it out okay so I'll demonstrate one and then we'll do two together so it's a nice big breath in everything's relaxed and as I exhale I'm gonna stick out my tongue open my eyes really wide and I'm going to spread my fingers out like big claws so we'll do two together take a big breath big ladle scooping up your worries let it go so your mouth is as wide as you can get it your fingers stretch as wide as you can your eyes are as wide as you can get them last one let's do it together beautiful can we keep our mouth in a really big smile even if you do not feel like it faking a smile will actually actually turn into a real one so I want you to turn your smile right up cheesy green and you can wipe your chin if you need to rest your hands down or up just comfortably on the lap slide yourself back into your chair and to rest and we're going to breathe that down through the heart through your stomach through your ribs and right down into the lower belly so if you need those two hands on your abdomen and chest to help guide that smile down then please feel free to do that we're gonna stay here for maybe three to four rounds of breath with that smile I'm going to keep reminding you to keep that smile really big and smiling really helps to alkalize and alkaline sorry and keep the muscles soft our heart lifting keep breathing keep smiling if you find any resistance to keeping a smile on your face just try to bring it up even more hard smile and let's relax the face come on up into a nice tall spine bring your hands together at the heart and take your head down towards your fingers take a breath together and we'll take a nice big

Hi everyone I'm kelly welcome to share yoga today's session is for your neck and shoulders and getting rid of any tightness that you might be experiencing so before we begin make sure that you've got a chair with the back uh preferably with no arms and you want to be able to make sure that your feet are connected to the floor having said that we position ourselves in the middle edge of the chair so we're not slouching back uh throughout the practice let's move ourselves forward and if your feet don't touch the ground you can get a big dictionary or a couple of books and stack them on top of each other so your feet are connected to something okay great let's begin so just take a moment our hands are going to be placed down on our lap today and notice how that feels feel the warmth of your hands here on your on your legs and you're in the center of your chair with both sitting bones pressing into that hard surface and just notice how or slump back into the chair and then pick ourselves up again just feel the difference between what it feels like to be resting backwards and lifting up nice and tall using our core so we let it all go and then using our belly so you can pull the belly button in towards the spine a little bit to gently lift and lengthen through the top of the head let's do a couple of these just to notice how that feels in your body today where you might be feeling any uh pain or tightness any aches just breathe deeply it's important that we notice how our body is moving and feeling okay and then come up nice and tall shoulders are dropped lifting up through the crown of the head we'll take our hands down by our sides and we'll begin together by inhaling nice and big breath bring the palms together and then exhale turn the hands out so the heels of the hands are pushing away from the body and they lower all the way down next to you and again we if your neck allows you to and hands touch and then the palms turn out we push the heels of the hands away all the way down the chinese to the throat if you find that lifting your arms up in this way causes pain then stop here at halfway turn the palms out and push the palms away on your way down so you're doing a half uh stretch as opposed to arms all the way up inhale hands come together this time the palms will come to your center line to your heart bow the head welcome inhale here hands come to the chest and we'll take that heel of the hand push it away keep it about shoulder height a little bit higher is good as well but again if it causes pain just to shoulder height is is great and we're gently twisting through the body and we're looking at our fingertips pressing that heel of the hand away getting the length in the arm breathing in coming back to center breathing out the other side now push through the heel of and we're going to move with your breath and imagining that you're lengthening that arm across the room getting nice long length not so much tense but stretch and feel your body want to become longer through the arms breathe out slow it down if you need to formal two three last one and four come back to center arms down big breath in squeeze the shoulders up to your ears and pull the back exhale let them go again big breath in exhale let them go one more interlace the fingers in front of your chest and turn the palms out so when you press the arms out in front here they're nice and long and you're it's like you're stretching and cracking your knuckles and then we're breathing in bringing the hands back to the chest breathe out push the hands away so what it looks like from the side is rounding the upper back just a little bit the chin is into the throat breathing hands come back to the chest and we sit up nice and tall breathe out the ears inhale and exhale go at your own pace we'll aim for six two three four five last one and six hold it there for a moment breathe into the back of the body into the shoulders and let's release arms down roll the shoulders up exhale take them back and see if you can take hold of the back of your chair or behind you and again lifting up nice and tall through the spine and pressing the chest forward and a little bit more and breathing right down your center line into your heart into the chest one more breath in one more long breath out and we can release take out the arms this time we breathe uh we bring our hands together and just bring the palms straight out inside we take a big breath in and as we breathe out we're swinging the arms to one side keeping both arms nice and straight and then we're turning our head looking in the opposite direction sometimes we want to try and get the arms around as far as we can and try and keep them as straight as we can and turning the head doesn't matter how far so we can really access these around the outside of the shoulders and then breathe in come back shoulders are relaxed breathing out both sitting bones gently pressing into your chair everything is nice and stable from the waist down use your breath a couple more looking the other way even if your head doesn't move you can still turn your eyes as far as you can one more each side come back to center and let's relax the arms and take our arms for a little bit of a walk ah flapping them lovely and come to stillness let's have a little slump in our chair sit back palms can face up this time you can close your eyes and just feel the upper body melting down down down into your chair and we like to take these little rests in between some movements just so we can notice our body gently unwinding and unraveling we focus on our breathing here in the west position always trying to sitting in the chair maybe we can start to listen to our breath come in and out we can feel the rise and fall of our chest upper back and as we inhale our upper back and shoulder area gently presses into the back of your chair as we breathe out everything softens and drops down a little bit further towards your hips and when you're ready slowly pull the belly button in towards the spine and lift yourself up nice and tall again taking your hand down taking hold of your chair just to the side we're going to take the other arm up and lengthen through the fingertips and take the arm across the body into a nice little side stretch so you're holding onto the chair so you don't top it but we're also wanting to actively push the hip down into the chair and keep the arm nice and straight if we can next to the ear open the chest up a little bit towards ceiling and hold if your arm is really not comfortable here tuck it in like a into the side body if your neck allows you can goes up underneath your arm towards the ceiling but don't worry if you can't looking down towards the floor is just as helpful let's take one more breath feel that whole side of your body open and stretch through the ribs through the hip and let's relax and float the arm down let's take a little slump back into our chair again ah it's always good to sigh and notice if there's any difference between your sides in our yoga practice we find that when our sides are really locked up and tight the rest of our body becomes tight and tense as well when we relax and release tension and holding in the sides of the body through the ribs through the hips we really bring a sense of lightness and softness to the body let's do the other side now how we're going to sit up is we're going to pull that belly button into our spine and move after we've done that great let's take going to lift up and lengthen that arm next to the ear or tuck it in like a wing and take it over anchoring down that opposite hip noticing how this side feels now both shoulders are relaxed so if this other shoulder is up in your ear and you're leaning into the chair let's drop it and use our hip bone like our sitting bone into the ground and gently move into into your side stretch so you might only go 10 of the way to start with and notice how that feels and then maybe you can take a few deep breaths and soften and relax into an opening position it does take our body a few breaths a few moments sometimes to warm into the posture and you can always look up towards the ceiling or looking down feeling those ribs open a stretch if it's too much you know you can back out and soften a little bit look for enjoyable stretch one more breath checking that you're relaxing and then let's release breathe in ah slump inside back into your how you feel notice any changes that you've created through stretching and breathing and softening and releasing into the side stretch again let's make our way up to an upright position engaging the belly and lift up so our upper body doesn't have to do any extra work okay so a gentle side of the ear comes down towards the shoulder but I want you to focus more on this ear opening up to the ceiling let's feel the ear moving towards the sky take a couple of breaths here as you press both hips down into your chin shoulders are soft and release I'm going to take the other end down but let's focus on this bright flower of your ear opening up to the sky to the sun breathing soft shoulders moving the hips down belly buttons moving gently in towards your spine take another breath and let's release beautiful and we'll just take our hands to either side of the chair or maybe you can see on your hands if that's comfortable for you you can roll the so we're going to lift up one knee one knee tap the toe tap the toe tap the toe and try to keep the chest nice and high so to lift the knee we don't want to sink we want to keep lifting up the heart tapping the toe four three two and one let's go to the other side tap one two three we're gonna go eight four five six chest up seven and eight beautiful both feet down see can we do two maybe one keep going and maybe alternate alternating is good one have another little go see if you can do two without dropping the chest keep alternating maybe you can throw in a double tap and try again chest up toes up and relax beautiful slump back into your chair for a moment give yourself a nice little rest after that one maybe a nice little sigh for a big sigh close your eyes ah let everything go let everything relax soften fill the chair underneath you again let's make our way up just but we're going to use pull the belly button in if you need the chair to help you a little bit and let's just lift and get comfortable again sitting bones moving into the chair we bring our arms out from our shoulders and we bring all the fingertips and the thumbs to touch then we're turning our wrists up so we're pointing all fingertips up towards the ceiling so I'm in this kind of bird pecking hand and pointing those fingers oh really we're going to try and get the fingertips to point towards our face but maybe they only get to the ceiling that's fine as well the shoulders are relaxed and jaunt and we're going to turn our head from left to right gaze at the fingers on one hand and then gaze at the fingers on the other hand and we're breathing as we do it and imagine that you are looking along the horizon to one side and then the other if keeping our nose level breathing and aim for about six it's too strong just do two or three or the shoulders a couple of times nice big breaths change direction with the shoulders roll them forward this time the arms come out again all of our fingers are going to touch to the thumbs turning them down now either pointing the fingers to the floor or towards the body shoulders are dropped this time we're looking up and looking down so try to isolate just the head breathing out breathing in center breathing out as we look up breathing in and breathing out again we're aiming for six we're lengthening the arms away from the body when you've done six or you've finished bring the arms down big breath in as we squeeze the shoulders up towards the ears exhale let them drop squeeze them to touch your ears drop one more squeeze squeeze squeeze no neck squeeze breathe in breathe in breathe in drop it beautiful tapping loose little wrist tapping punching the top of your shoulder like big roping muscle up there gets nice and tight and we want to release it now the only time you wouldn't do this is and let's go to the other side pounding the other shoulder down if you've got someone with you maybe they can do it for you it feels really great for someone else to do it deep breaths for all of us shoulder pounding to release that muscle and then we're going to relax let's take our arms for a walk again deep breaths right okay so I'm going to do some uh push-ups so our hands will come to our chest and we're going to press the hands away for the arms straight and then as we lower we're pretending we're bringing our chest towards the floor we're squeezing the elbows back so we inhale breathe out as we lower our chest to the floor so inhale exhale we're just using the arms we're pulling the arms back and we're going to go for eight one two three four five and six and relax sink back into your chair let everything go for a moment arms can hang or they can rest on your lap close your eyes chest into the heart into the top of the shoulders into the back around your neck and when you're ready we're going to make our way up to that nice tall starting position again engage your belly as you lift and we're moving through a cat cow in this sitting I like to call it riding the camel and I'll show you what it looks like from the side we're curling through the spine so we're shooting making sure that our bottom's in the center and we're rounding so we're rolling to the bone with our hips and we're pulling our chin in and rounding through the upper back and then as we breathe in we're lifting the chest up and we're moving high up on the sitting lines so open heart here and then we breathe out and curl and breathing in moving forward and if this is comfortable for you and enough then keep going with this one it's a great one for releasing tension through the whole spine but especially our upper body area we move forward the chin moves into the throat as we move down the shoulders are always relaxed and moving away from the ears they're actually not doing anything I'm going to use that core to pull you in and to move you forward so the upper body just gently opens if you want to make this a little bit more challenging we can bring the arms in so we can bring the arms into this position into a right angles to the body palms are pressing together so we're going to breathe in and then we're going to breathe out squeezing the elbows actually let's change the breath or inhale with everyone we'll do it the same inhale and exhale elbows are going to touch inhale and exhale if it's too much hands can stay on the knees do what feels right for you today four more and then come back to center position relaxing your arms for a moment feel free to slump slouch back into the chair just let everything soften for a moment and then we're going to I'll show you what that looks like first we take we're actually turning our whole body around to one side it doesn't matter which we're going to do both so we're turning ourselves around so I've got the chair uh back to my side now I can hold on to that if I need a little bit of balance now this outside leg is going to move back and you can move it back ideally the knee is in line with the hip and we can scoot ourselves so we're comfortable and stable here so one of my sitting bones is on the chair the other one's almost hanging off and we position again so both feet are connected to the ground so scoot around the chair to make sure you're as comfortable as you can we're bringing our hands together into this position again so the elbows and the palms are touching and bowing forward inhale we're going to lift exhale forward if the arms are creating instability for you keep your hand on the chair behind you we did before breathing in and breathing out we're aiming six to eight rounds keeping the elbows close and touching scroll it down if you need to and when you've done enough come back turn yourself around let's take a moment to pause before we do the other side just relax back into your chair let everything go for a moment actively mindfully relax the face the sides of the neck the shoulders the heart the hips take a long breath right down your center line exhale release drop the shoulders a little more and the chin moves gently in towards the throat so there's no holding tension in the back of the neck at all and when you're ready we'll slowly make our way over to the other side engage your belly come to seat turn your whole body around to the other side adjust yourself so you're in warrior one both feet connected you're stable pick your arm position either holding the chair or elbows together palms together breathing in gazing up breathing out curling into your cat your feet to curl keep the breath moving even the smallest movements are beneficial for the body make sure your breath is smooth and even and when you've done enough come back to center and relax back into your chair take an inhale ah closing your eyes down relaxing all muscles in the body even loosen the jaw in your in your mouth you can make big movements with the mouth like a cow chewing grass to help release the big joints that we have in our jaw and when we're feeling tight in the upper body we do have a tendency to clench the jaw let's do some while we're resting some big cow chewing and completely relax again move the chin in towards your throat so the back of the neck is a little loose and open take a long breath in here breathe it all out and again engage your lower belly to sit up we're trying to create a new habit instead of using our shoulders to do the lower body's work engage the belly lift yourself we're finishing our physical the back of our chair or underneath the chair opposite hand across the body to the outside of your knee or as wherever you can reach we breathe in we lengthen the spine and we exhale and twist around towards the hands we're doing we're going to do the twist to where it feels most comfortable for me so we're not forcing we're lifting up and lengthening breathing in and as we breathe out we soften the shoulders and we gently twist through the middle of the body we can use our hands to gently press our way around a little bit more and we can also turn our head and our eyes around as far as we can but if that doesn't feel okay for your neck at all then you're just going to have a soft gaze untowards the floor the most important thing here is your breathing it will tell you whether you're in the right position or not so if your breath is labored or short or catching you know you're in the wrong position so just soften what it means and then relax and come back let's go over to the other side lift the length drop the shoulders twist around to the other side smooth breaths use the hands if you want a little bit more intensity goes behind you if you need a little bit more maybe your eyes can turn and look at the furthest point really great for stretching the muscles of the eyes nourishing the tendons and the muscles from the back of your eyes and let's release and we'll come back to center take a big inhale exhale slouch back into your chair well done gentle breaths as you relax in your rest pose following the breath in and following the breath out so let's come on up into our nice tall seat again engaging the belly and finishing our practice with a breathing technique alternate nostril breathing we are going to use our index fingers and thumbs very simple we're going to block the right nostril with our thumb and we're going to breathe in through the left nostril block the left nostril nostril inhale through the right nostril lock the nostril with your thumb and exhale out through the left nostril inhale through the left block the left and exhale out through the right inhale through the right sit up nice and tall lock and exhale out through the left close your eyes down down inhale through the left we're going to slow the breathing down lock the left and exhale out through the right without all the breath inhale through the right nostril lock it and exhale out through the left nostril shoulders are soft breathing through the left lock and exhale out through the right inhale through the right exhale out through the left inhale through the left lock and exhale out through the right inhale through the right lock and exhale out through the left one more round inhale through the left lock and exhale can't we bring your arms or hands down palms are up standing or sitting and

 g'day build I'm very excited today to be introducing compost bins in apartment buildings now this has got many great benefits one of those is that we're bringing communities closer together that live in these apartments now rachel what are some of the other great environmental benefits of having a compost bin in your apartment block well john our studies show that about a third of the waste that's in our general waste bins is actually food scraps that we could have put in compost systems worm farms and things like that and while we're pleased to hear that more and more burwood residents are getting involved with composting in their households residents who live in apartments just often don't have the space to do that sort of a thing so by having a shared compost system we're providing those residents the opportunity to put their food scraps into a compost so that it doesn't end up in landfill so if we get more food waste in these compost bins and out of your garbage bin it's going to reduce get some more information meet your neighbors get together and come and help us create more compost bins in our apartment buildings here in our town centre you

Vaccination rates climbing two million people in the hotspot local government areas have had a small reprieve the one-hour limit on exercise has been removed but the curfew still remains in place it was a combination of health advice but also we want people to get fresh air especially if the weather is warming up some argue they shouldn't be included at all I'm begging the state government to show some compassion and take the wood off the list of hotspot areas while the hotspot areas account for almost 80 percent of today's cases burwood again recorded zero and it isn't a one-off these rules are confusing and they're frustrating you don't only look at the number of cases in a particular location but also where the movements are and where the cases are going so we're looking at that on a daily basis also under review exactly what freedoms will be on offer when we hit 70 percent fully vaccinated one thing being considered allowing sydney siders to travel to regional parts of the state if they've had both doses
Get a bill and I'm at the intersection of railway parade a billet road we've been stalled a trial for these new pedestrian crossings where you actually don't have to touch the button anymore it's got a sensor so you put your hand in front of it you turn screen and it actually motions the actual signal for your pedestrian crossing so please look out for these sighs really interested to hear your feedback on what you think of these especially in the whole covert environment at the moment we want to make sure people are keeping their hands sanitized and keeping safe during this time you
 on abc radio sydney this is breakfast well you mentioned the picnics uh yesterday and it was cold and it was windy but there were still folk out at my local park determined and I have that picnic with their umbrellas it wasn't actually raining but it was windy and it was cold with their puffer jackets on of course yep yeah but uh you're right the the unhappy campers those mayors of the local government areas of concern uh the the premier gladys barry jaclyn has invited the mayors uh to meet with her today to today to discuss their frustrations and the impact of the strict lockdown on their local community well this meeting coincides with a call by a number of liberal mps the police minister david elliot elliott and a member for seven hills mark taylor are both wanting the premier to rethink lockdown boundaries so that some suburbs can open up uh suggestions that perhaps it should go by I don't know postcode as opposed to those local government areas particularly if those lgas have been amalgamated recently so with's the mayor of the burwood council uh a council that is under lockdown but of course has lower numbers than some other council areas with higher uh figures morning john good morning well I guess so we can all see now that tempers are getting pretty frayed with this john what are you going to tell the premier today well I'm going to be telling the premier exactly what my residents have been telling me daily and that's the impacts the lockdowns are having on people in our community the impacts on jobs small businesses and mental health so what the premier should be doing and what I will be raising with her is that she needs to give people hope for the future and reward areas like bill would that have low covet cases and high vaccination rate and we hear that some of the lower vaccination rates are in fact you know in the centre of the city have you been keeping your eye on the figures well our figures uh currently we have 69 active cases we have adjoining council areas that have nearly on the hot spot list and they're not and I have residents telling me daily that they feel they're being discriminated against so the premier really needs to reward our community which have stepped up we're getting our vaccination rates up we have nearly 80 of our community having their first vaccination which is amongst some of the highest rates in the country so the premier really needs to reward communities like billwood not punishing us I wonder whether you'd like to join this conversation this morning you're very welcome if you live uh in one of these lgas of concern how are you feeling about things or if you live outside you know you're quite welcome to contribute as well 1300 to 702 is our phone number or you can text on oh four six seven nine double to 702 now john uh having a look at the figures from yesterday I noticed that burwood had four cases yesterday the inner west had nine cases yesterday and the city of sydney had 56 cases uh yesterday I i take it that's some meeting with the premier but what are the the proposals that you will be making I mean are you looking at a postcode by postcode scenario what do you think the solution is well the solution is the premier needs to give hope for the future to residents from the whole build lga because we've only had sure but what should that look like I mean have you got some some firm ideas that you can throw on the table here well the idea is is we need to lift the curfews um it's makes no logical sense that we can have a picnic for two hours yet you can have a picnic uh in other areas that aren't in the hot spot area for three hours it makes no logical sense I mean how is it safe to have a picnic for three hours but it's not safe to have one for two hours okay so they're the type of things I'll be talking to the premiere about and you mentioned the curfew earlier on what sort of effect is the curfew having well we we the the effects that it's having is that I've got residents that are hard working they've got small businesses so they're rushing home to get back by 9 pm and it makes no logical sense with an area that's had a handful of cases over the last week only 69 active cases now since june the premier really has to reward communities that are doing the right thing and my residents are stepping up they're stepping up and getting vaccinated um they're complying with the covert restrictions so give them hope give them hope for the future and take us off the hot spot list yeah well john if you I've got a few texts here saying well I don't know maybe these mayors should stop grandstanding there are council elections in two months time uh what do you say to that okay this isn't about politics this is about working with the premier and having her talk to us and seeing us as a partner so we can work together to get our communities out of seeing what comes out of this meeting this morning with the premier and uh thanks for finding the time for us this morning john thank you good morning uh john faker who is the mayor of burwood council yeah just one of those many mayors from the lgas of concern who will be meeting with the premier later this morning yep that's right um burwood lga has four suburbs there burwood burwood heights enfield and enfield heights it's also got parts of croydon croydon park and strathfield in it much smaller than nearby inner west and canterbury bankstown lga is of concern wake up with robbie and wendy for breakfast
I'm here in front of our sundaka memorial in billwood park and while this sunday we won't be able to hold a full public service we will be coming together to hold a mini service to honor those men who perished during the sundark and death marches in borneo at the end of world war ii this year marks the 75th anniversary in what is one of australia's darkest moments in its military history where over 2 000 allied prisoners of war died 23 of those men were from our local area here in berlin we'll be coming to remember those men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our community and our nation and I encourage you to take a moment this sunday to remember the ultimate sacrifice they paid lest we forget you
Crack in new south wales after another day of falling positive tests this is the premier had crisis talks with the mayors of hospital gas who are calling for equal treatment when it comes to restrictions now cases have fallen for a third straight day to 1127. it is too early to really identify trends when there are so many factors involved however today's case numbers were the lowest since the 1st of september with some experts suggesting there may be a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel now the biggest reason for optimism is the vaccination rate more than 8.2 million doses have gone into arms in our state nearly 80 percent of over 16s have had their first dose if new south wales were a country that record will be the sixth best in the world however there is mounting anger across the suburbs as some sydney siders ensure the harshest possible lockdown despite having few local cases bird mayor john faker walking his side of a divided suburb croydon with just six cases in two weeks is split by covert and red tape thing is dan if you walk 30 meters down that way you're actually then in the near west council which is not a hospital area even though we're in the same suburb there's no scientific reason that would suggest that across the road is safer than this side of clothing with his lga notching up only a handful of infections each day he's no longer asking he's pleading for burward to be set for it well it is pleading because it makes no sense today he and 12 other mayors met by a zoo with the premiere pitching their case for restrictions to be lifted you can't divide people through an imaginary line on a mac uh sydney is one area and we need to do this together there were no guarantees given today what she did promised though is that she'll go back and speak to cabinet she'll go back and speak to health and look at any sort of restrictions that can be used it's her career on the line if she doesn't deliver people are gonna remember deaths and 231 patients are now in intensive care but the number of new cases is 1127. the lowest figure in two weeks meal I'll be having a sneaky glass of champagne my own data tell me that it's highly likely that this happens has peeked out health officials admit it's encouraging but we'd like to see a few more days before we can um have confidence about whether there is a trend no politicians at the morning news conference today leaving bureaucrats to answer the questions is there a health reason why we've been sticking with the lgas rather than defining it by suburb this is all open to continue review one of the factors that makes it more practical for using lga level is the ability for people to move about about to do essential activities so let's have a look at some of the inconsistencies this is a breakdown of where the outbreaks are the areas in black a lot of cases it's concentrated mainly on those lgas of concern but there are some really stark examples of where it area of concern but have a look at this the cases are incredibly low just 23 since the outbreak began and just eight active cases right now in a population of more than 33 000 now across town in maroubra it's a similar sized population it has 219 total cases with 96 active right now and it is not subject to the tighter restrictions up in black tower well another area of concern have a look at the ponds just 14 active cases right now over in red firmo they have 100 active cases again a similar size population to the ponds and they're not facing those tougher rules now no system is perfect but you can see of course why some residents are pretty fed up after months and months of this we would say to the government where is this up to is it based on health advice what information are you processing throw up to the media and explain your decisions especially with vaccination rates soaring the state is likely to hit 80 percent first dose by tomorrow daniel sutton continues first
While our community's been doing well we need to do more and that's why we need to increase our testing so come out this thursday friday and saturday we have new south wales health in billwood park doing covert 19 testing so if you're feeling unwell please come out and get tested the more people we get tested the safer our community is you
Asbury nuclear was absent from today's cover 19 update instead holding an important meeting with mares from sydney's 12 hot spot lgas we're joined now by couple and mayor steve christo and burwood mayor john faker let's go first to you steve you've been calling for this meeting for a long time what did you speak about absolutely I've been calling for this meeting since day one of lockdown and thankfully the day came for the premier to hear some realities we spoke about western sydney extended lockdowns and curfews and the unfair situation placed upon our people and why as a number one area of concern due to covert cases we have not been given a vaccination steve your community has been hard locked down for months now but there was still 118 cases there in the past 24 hours how are you going to get those numbers down well we're doing our best to encourage the community to go out and get vaccinated but in the same statement it's very hard to get the numbers down when unfortunately the contact people the system is stressed and that's just the realities so we need to work out a way where we apply more resources into contact tracing so people are contracted when they've been exposed more quickly and within one or two days I know it's hard but it needs to happen or we're never going to get the numbers down whilst we lag roughly a week and a half behind in contacting people when they've had close exposure to clover 19. john burwood had just five cases yet you're under the same restrictions as lgas with hundreds of cases per day and the city of sydney had 36 cases that isn't a hot spot so is that all fair it's totally unfair natalia and it's not fair that my residents continue to have these added restrictions and I spoke to the premier today I put to her that our residents have been working really hard to comply with the covert restriction we've lifted our vaccination rates we've got nearly 80 of our residents who've had their first vaccination the same added restrictions and the impacts these lockdowns are having on our people in our communities the impacts to jobs small businesses and mental health and john how frustrating was it to see pictures of people at the beaches on the weekend when people in your community can only go outside for two hours a day well natalia it's not our we don't have a problem with people in the eastern suburbs going to the beach or you know enjoying a picnic all we want is to have uh to be treated fairly and have the same freedoms as people in other communities considering we have loan covert case numbers and very high vaccination rates so I'm pleading with the premier to have her government lift forward as a hotspot lga and to reward reward communities that are doing the right thing reward communities that have stepped up and lifted their vaccination rates as an example take us off the hot spot list john do you think the premier has listened to what you just said I hope she listens to what we've said because want to work together so we can get out of these lockdowns a lot sooner now it's really important about getting through this campaign and lifting our vaccination rates then she needs to work with local governments not work against us she needs to reward counselors and communities that are doing the right thing and by working with local councils now local governments she has access then to people on the ground she has access to communities we're out day in day out speaking to our residents and we can help the government and get its and steve after your meeting with the premier today do you feel like any progress has been made well the premier was definitely given realities and uh we expressed the frustrations of not only our local residents but the other local residents that are part of the 12 lockdown ogas and suffering curfews the premiere did not make any promises but she definitely got the message doubting and she took plenty of notes all right well thank you both very much for your time and all the best in the future awesome

Now bears from sydney so-called lgas of concern will finally meet with the new south wales premier of gladysburg jupiter this morning for the first time since sydney's lockdown was implemented nearly three months ago boomwood mayor john faker will take part in today's virtual summit he joins us now john good morning so what do you want to tell the premier well I'll be echoing the concerns that I've been hearing from my residents daily and I'll be telling the premier the impacts that lockdowns are having on the people in our communities and the impacts it's having on jobs small businesses mental health so I'll be raising the need to give people hope for the future and rewarding areas like billwood that have been doing the right thing with low covert cases and higher vaccination rates so do you think it's unfair that uh bird and suburbs in your municipality are caught up uh in the heightened restrictions well it's totally unfair because we've only got 69 active cases and we've got adjoining councils that have nearly residents keep and constantly telling me that they are feeling discriminated against so today I'll be pleading with the premier to take the wood off the list of hot spot areas because it makes no logical sense our residents are doing the right thing by complying with covert restrictions our residents are stepping up and getting vaccinated over 80 percent of my community has now had their first vaccination which is amongst the highest rates uh in the country so the premier needs to be rewarding communities like forward that are doing the right thing not punishing us by keeping us on as a hot spot area okay but so realistically john what are the hopes of that happening after the meeting well I'll be pleading with the premier today because it makes no logical sense it makes no logical sense that you've got a community in billwood that can have a picnic for two hours yet outside hotspot areas you can have a picnic for more than two hours so tell me how is it safe to have a picnic for two hours yet it's or not and these are the absurd and unfair rules that you know my community hate um they hope they hate them because they're completely and totally irrational and they make no sense john vega mayor of wood uh thank you uh for joining the headquarters shaping up clearly it's a pretty robust meeting between you the other mayors and the premier folk thank you have a good morning okay let's
You know Bullard I'm here with counselor Heather Crichton proud to announce that we've got some funding from the state government a million dollars as part of a two and a half million dollar project to build two multi-purpose courts here which will house our two local netball teams so it's fantastic news we're so excited about it the two courts will actually be able to be used also as basketball and volleyball courts we're going to increase the parking in this park as well as have nighttime lighting more spectator bench seating and bubbler systems so really happy and we can't wait for the project to start
Thanks laura well premier gladys energy clan will meet with the mayors from sydney's 12 lgas of concern today after declining an online meeting last month they will discuss a range of topics of course including the easing of restrictions but we want to focus on areas such as burwood who only has 69 active covered cases joining me live now is the mayor of burwood john faker thanks so much for your time mayor what will you be telling and asking of gladys virgin clan today oh laura I'll be echoing the concerns that many of my residents have been speaking to me on a daily basis now um and I'll be telling her about the impacts of lockdowns and the impacts they're having on people in my community and the impacts on jobs local businesses people's mental health you know what we need to be focusing on and what the premier needs to be doing is giving people hope for the future and rewarding areas like build which have low covert cases and high vaccination rates well we're all getting rewarded together you talking about are you talking about burwood coming out of curfew not being declared as an lga of concern well exactly laura there's absolutely no reason why bill would should remain a hotspot area considering we only have 69 active cases so I'll be pleading to the premiere today for her government to take us off that list we've got adjoining councils that have nearly 400 cases and are not on the hotspot area so we need to yeah absolutely sorry to interrupt you john when you talk about curfews as well do you think there's now really a flimsy health reason to have them in place well it makes so it absolutely makes no sense that you have an area such as ours that's a hot spot area that has low covert cases but high vaccination rates for example let me ask you this why is it that we can go for a picnic for two hours um and if you're outside a hot spot area you can go for a bit for three hours so is it safe or not to these rules are ridiculous um you know it's upsetting and frustrating to our residents who are doing the right thing um who have stepped up and gotten vaccinated we've got nearly 80 of my community now um that they've had their first vaccination which are you know among the highest rates in the country so for vaccination rates so it makes no sense and I'm plenty on the premier to take us off the hot spot list and reward reward communities like bill that have done the right thing that have been complying with the covered restrictions and that are lifting those vaccination runs right so you want them essentially burwood to be in line with those areas outside of those 12 hot spot lga so people are fully vaccinated can have a picnic with five well exactly laura because you know it's starting to become very frustrating for residents they're starting to feel as if they're being discriminated against we're not against people for example in the eastern suburbs going to the beach or enjoying a picnic we just want to're getting in other areas considering we have those low coverage rates um and that we have very high vaccination rates so that the premium needs to give people hug give communities hope and reward communities that are doing the right thing do you accept that when we do get to 70 and the premier has said that once we do collectively all together we'll have these freedoms that she has talked about but if there are suburbs with really high case numbers and you see infections grow do you accept that some suburbs that might be your own will need to go into a lockdown well there's no reason why we should be going into a lockdown considering the health advice has always been about increasing vaccination rates so my community has stepped up um you know we've got nearly 80 of our residents that are now having their first vaccination nearly 40 that are fully vaccinated there is no logical reason why my residents can't_''_268.4 be going out and enjoying uh picnics like they are across sydney uh outside hot spot areas so it add these are the rules that are building resentment um and these rules are really uh unfair for communities um that are doing the right thing so the premier needs uh you know I reiterate the premier needs to give people confidence to show that the government has a plan uh and reward communities that are continually showing that they're doing the right thing all right we'll see how that meeting ends up john faker thanks for your time thanks lauren to speak to you again the wood man meeting with gladys burjicli in about 15 minutes time
Tell you what seeing that guy performing at reading festival the other day you'd think there was no covert anywhere a little bit of love ten past seven now the world has got over covert they're moving on uh australia and new zealand are stuck behind there's no doubt about that uh we're trying to make it's the squabbling it's the squabbling between the states it's the squabbling between the now local government you know where some places are less it's just getting what are we it's the crazy rules that we have no idea what we're meant to be doing because they change making them up they change every single day on the news last night we're watching some lgas are completely shut and others aren't who are next door and some of them have got more cases and they're open the ones that don't have any cases and they're shut here was an example of the madness there are questions over burwood's status as a hotspot cases have remained as low as inner west randwick and ryde have seen an increase in infections so we're joined by the mayor of burwood john faker mate are you shaking your head at the fact that your area is still locked down well mate I thought I was the only one confused but you two seem as confused as I because we can't work out why the premier is still locking down an area that only has a handful of cases so we're feeling discriminated against at the moment and when you call uh john you know you're a met you're a mayor of a major part of sydney when you try and get hold of someone in the state government to go hey look what is what is what's going on here what happens well they haven't been communicating with us at all like we didn't even receive a formal communication telling us that we're a hot spot area we learned about it on 11 a.m briefings so I've written to the premier and the health minister to to work out okay well what to the hotspot list so we know how to get out of it that's a great information what a great word criteria john that is such a great word you know what are we using here what are the benchmarks here I put it to you john that they wouldn't know because they're making it up uh without really thinking about it in any great depth and uh they've just forgotten that they even probably locked you down well that's that's a real possibility because um and look with the pandemic you know it's really important we're all in this together so this isn't about politics right so this is about the premier responding to the mayors of the hotspot areas to sit down and work with us because you know our council has been planning around this pandemic and trying to get our residents vaccinated because that's the key to get my residence out of a hot spot and getting them out of this lockdown and the state really so we've been calling on the government new south responded we have to actually go out and arrange those ourselves we had to call for a well we're continuing to call for a permanent walk-in vaccination hub because you know if you're a hot spot area and we want to increase vaccination rates let's get the vaccine out to the people can I say john the the permanent walk-in vaccination hubs should be in every single suburb and spend the money there so that everyone can get vaccinated and within six weeks if you haven't got vaccinated it's obviously your decision you're not going to get vaccinated and so we can open up john is that fair well you're spot on uh you're spot on and you know the key is as I mentioned increasing those vaccination rates you know my residents are starting to lose hope because they can everyone's starting to realize that I think the government you know doesn't have a plan they've lost control of this mess they don't know how to get us out of it they seem to be changing the's too hard to keep up with now um it's confusing residents uh yeah people need hope people need a plan people need to see the end goal so we know how to actually as a team and as a community get through this together and that's why the premiere I think was you know it was silly of her not to sit down with the mayors because the mayors are the closest to the people on the ground and we know what's happening we're speaking so I had a resident that wrote to me who's 37 weeks pregnant and now because we're a hot spot area her partner can't attend with her to hospital and she's frightened mate it's crazy look let's hope the premier and her team are listening or at least hear about this and they absolutely start talking to people like john every single day yep and so that we can as everyone can be on the same page and we can move on with as much as john look I i get up fusey every with people john and I'm like might get off but I'm starting to come around to the point now with it might be the only thing they listen to if people have got social media people can write an email or a letter or something to your local politician today or to a premier do it it might be the only thing that gets them to realize what's actually what's actually going on yeah you know what I mean good luck john cause if john can't get through anyway john mayor of berwick thanks so much mate we'll check back in soon thanks gents have a good morning
In a john faker the miracle welcome here to Woodstock where today we're unveiling our first street art project it's called city that's done by a local artist called Sibyl tapir this is one of many projects to come these projects are designed to activate our streets and provide diversity and color and enjoyment and as well as that for our local community so we hope you enjoy CC which represents a story of a elephant that was lost and found here in 1933 in Woodstock from a circus in Stratford so we hope you enjoy this and many more street art projects we have two now regarding the conceptions were other concept came about community consultation we got together with council members and we thought okay what can we do to be able to bring about a new law that's really in a blessed community and talk to the community in such a way that it covers most ground and you touched upon a few things but then we sort of come together the idea that our lips reach out in the we ended up coming back with the story of CC which were amazingly and we you know getting together even through constant consulting is really effective because you able to bounce ideas off each other immediately and in that way there's a creative process that brings about you
Well covered cases across the inner west suburb of burwood have remained very low during sydney's outbreak zero cases detected in the suburb yesterday however despite the low infection bergwood is one of the 12 lgas under the harshest lockdown restrictions seen across the state joining us live now is the mayor of burwood john faker john I know you're pretty frustrated about this have you had any indication that your frustration may be alleviated anytime soon well we've had no communication uh laura with the uh government we still haven't even had an official communication that we're a hotspot area so it is frustrating uh the communication has been quite poor but we're continuing with our work to ensure that we get the message out to our residents to lift our vaccination rates and that's why I've been begging on the state government to provide us with a walk-in vaccination hub so we can lift those vaccination rates yes so what's your rate of the situation then that people uh there's a lot of vaccines available now astrazeneca and people having to travel too far to get these vaccines is that the problem well that's exactly the problem uh maura one of the things that the government has been trying to tell people is to restrict their mobility and it's quite hard then to tell people go to a central location a massive a mass vaccination hub and get vaccinated we've been calling the key component of my council's plan other than information and communication has been to call on the government to provide us with a permanent vaccination hub in building because we believe in prevention rather than reacting to the epidemic so if we have a walking vaccination hub here we're taking the vaccine to the people and I have many residents many of my residents are actually emailing calling telling us how can we get vaccinated in an easy and quick manner look the state seems to be responding we've hit that 6 million vaccine target that was about a week early I would say the premier graduation is talking about giving some vaccinated people some freedoms there's talk oh absolutely we would welcome that my residents frustrated now as as am I because there's no reason why we should be a hot spot area with uh I think it was about 30 cases in the last month I think we've had about just on 10 over the last week uh if you compare that with an adjoining council like inner west which has had nearly 150 cases I think 40 last week alone uh canada may has had close to 60 cases I believe there's no reason it doesn't make any sense and to this day we still have not received any communication from the government um from the premier or the health minister as to why we have been designated a hotspot area the issue laura is that it replaces a lot more restrictions on our residents especially for a community that is hard working and we've got many of our residents who are business owners we've got many people now that have to obtain a permit system or go into a permit system to actually leave to go to work a lady that was 37 weeks pregnant who is now afraid and concerned because she doesn't know how she can attend hospital and her husband can't attend with her because she comes from a hot spot area yeah it is heartbreaking for expectant moms at the moment that's for sure before I'll let you go you know we're talking about this national plan that not all the premiers seem to be signed up to at the moment when we reach that which that 80 percent a full vaccination rate right against across the country you know there seems to already be privileges for the vaccinated how does how do you and how does your community feel about that do you see that essentially we'll have a vaccine passport well I think that's where people consider that's where we're leading and where governments are leaving our community really at this stage and myself and our council aren't concerned with the politics of this epidemic we really want the prime minister and the premiers to just show the australian people and my people are losing incomes our businesses are hitting the wall and could possibly go bankrupt people are suffering rural mental health issues laura people just want to get back to normal so what we need to do is just stay focused on message we need to provide centers in locations such as the hotspot areas to lift those vaccination rates because as I mentioned that's the key component of my council's plan so we can get our businesses open we can get our residents back to work we can start to have people living a normal life again so people just want their governments and their community leaders to step up and show them and have a plan because this state government's lost their plan and and really it's it seems to have just as if it's given up hope um which has left a uh vacuum uh a leadership vacuum at the moment so it's insane it's important for the community to step up yep we'll we'll see those uh numbers today and hopefully all the labor premiers can sign thanks so much for your time thanks laura thanks for having me stay with us on
They builded one of my priorities as marries to increase the beautification of our streets by putting in new trees that actually provide some flowering across the seasons as well as increasing our tree canopy and I'm happy to announce that we're rolling out 500 new trees as part of 100,000 program that was put together to put 500 new flowering trees across our local government area so keep an eye out for these trees we've started the program today we've got Richard and Alana behind me who are planting some beautiful flaming Illawarra trees here at Wankel Park so enjoy the trees and make sure that if you see anybody vandalizing any of these new trees please report it to Council please keep safe during this time as well
They come down john what's the main concern for residents in burwood what's the situation like on the ground there at the moment well matt the main concern is that people are starting to lose hope because they can see that the government's lost control of this pandemic and they don't have a real plan to get us out of this mess it's as if the state government's given up hope and it's left a vacuum of leadership so it's really important for our local governments our community leaders our residents to step up and get vaccinated because lifting our vaccination rates is the key to lifting our restrictions and getting us out of this lockdown uh john the stress I can hear in your voice is the stress I've heard in a lot of small businesses throughout this week who are really struggling really trying to get that government support and it's not flowing through they just can't even get through to the support lines are you worried now about the long-term effects how bad are they going the long term the economy involved will bounce back because we are a strong we're a resilient and we're a hard working community my main concerns though are that in the impacts it'll have in the next few months with people losing their jobs and their incomes businesses hitting the wall possibly going bankrupt people suffering real mental health issues and that's why we need to get through this as soon as possible and I'm begging I'm begging on the state government to locate a walking vaccination hub here in billwood because that is the key component of our council's plan which is to lift vaccination rates so we can get businesses open we can get our residents back to work and we get we can get people uh and get their lives back to normal well said john whatever it takes to get those vaccination rates up thank you gentlemen for joining us on sunrise this morning here's that
Well welcome everybody um and thank you very much for your interest in standing for local government and um by the end of today's session you'll have a very uh good understanding of what's expected in the role and the requirements of of standing for local government and any questions that you might have have been answered before we kick off I'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land in which all of us are situated for today's discussion and um their elders past and present I introduce myself my name's karen legg and I've been asked by the wood council to facilitate this discussion to support people considering running for local government to make an informed decision about their candidacy um some quick housekeeping before we get started uh just a reminder that this session is being recorded and will be available on council's website uh in due course so that other people may refer to it or you can go back and revisit some of the information if you wish to and at the conclusion of the session slides that we go through with the information and the notes attached to them and we'll refer to that again at the end of the session um if you have questions along the way please use the chat function as was just discussed with you and if you could keep your microphones muted and video off it will help with the speed of the of this presentation as we go through and then at the conclusion when we have the open questions and and further discussion with you as as participants then obviously we'll get you to turn on your mics at that point um I'll just uh quickly hand over to bill council's general manager mr tommaso rosaceae um and he will just give you a quick overview of the burwood council context and some of the key information that will help you to understand where council is at the moment so over to you tomorrow ah thanks karen and uh and welcome everyone and thank you for joining us on this very important day despite the the our dream was to obviously have you our in our bedrooms and different offices um and I'd like to thank karen it was a pleasure when my guys and my team told me that we secured karen to run this session because she's one of the best in the business so I know that she'll be able to give us a great overview but also answer questions any questions you might have um I like to sort of mention two two things tonight uh one is uh congratulations uh for taking this important step um choosing to run for public office is is not an easy decision and one that I respect you have my full respect for it um and I like to get one bit that is the competitive bit out of the way before I talk about context um I think uh let's face it over the next few weeks you'll be part of a race a competitive process to get um I guess a c on on our council and it's a council that has only seven spots and so um it's quite a competitive environment'm not sure which party or which group political group you you are going to be running for or with but and nevertheless uh I wish you all the best uh for for the race um this I was saying to karen just moments ago that this will be the fourth election that I personally experience at world council having started just on the casp of the 2008 elections and I must say that um you know my experience and our history has been one of a very very clean campaigns civilized competitive nevertheless but without I guess the uh unnecessary pettiness that we might see in other areas of sydney so I'm hoping that we will see exactly the same this this time around but I guess the point I like to make is whether whether you will become a counselor or a board or not um I believe you've already taken a very important and big step towards taking an interest in community governance in in how councils operate and understanding the essential role that we play in shape in our place in communities and um I hope you will continue to connect with me as of today my team and council in in our journey um you know towards the future of world and um and just if I may spend a few minutes um to talk about that that journey um I like to I guess share my views on on on burwood and a bit of context around our area I might be telling you things you already know um but I think it's important that I'm that I share my views broad broad systems obviously geography burwood is a strategic center in the context of global sydney we position between city the city and parramatta we have three stations and one metro station coming so critical aspects from a geographical strategic point of view growth we are a growth center the population is growing we've got targets set by the state governments and we're obviously managing that in in the best possible way growth presents challenges and opportunities and we're not going to obviously have a discussion today but I want to ensure that I clarify build community build community and how do we do that firstly is through awareness and engagement or about through the community is who is out there their residents and business stakeholders I'm not going to say anything new when I say that we have a highly multicultural community all you need to do is walk around very well to to understand that but one bit of data that I always share with my guys my themes is that at the last census um the statistics about burwood show that 32 of our residents had just arrived not just in burwood but in the country in the previous three to four years and so um that presents a wonderful opportunity for us to discover who our residents are so that means one in three of our residents people that you meet on the streets of burwood have pretty much just arrived in in the australian system if you like so this requires meaningfully engagement um requires an outreach from council to understand um communities needs and aspirations and it's something that we really are working hard for the other is obviously to do place management with all the aspects connected to it but fundamentally that means that we have a job in in in ensuring that this livability now we're talking about love ability of the area so for us it's about creating a sense of pride those who choose to live in birdwood and for those who have lived in burwood for many years it's about maintaining and discovering the sense of pride and belonging to our place another important aspect is demographics is the age we have a relatively young community in burwood mostly our residents are in the 20 to 45 year old bracket and so a very tech-savvy community and and that shows in the um very strong we call it the digital community that we have and as such we we engage across multiple platforms for example we were one of the first councils in the country to set up an official wechat account for council and our community there is is growing week after week if you have been around burwood you would see that we are quite a progressive we have important projects currently underway for our community you you might have seen a new library a new community hub we are finalizing a new pool in enfield we have two new multiple multi-purpose courts at green park being built we have new amenities in henley park and these these are just projects that we've been running in the last one to two years and so for a relatively small council we we run a very ambitious program of projects and initiatives for the community we've also embarked on a a program aimed at greening in our city and we've been planting a thousand new trees and you might have noticed around town that we are progressively replacing a lot of our hard surfaces um with soft landscaping and planting and and and really these are just a few of the things we do and and so I suppose as you embark on this journey of discovery and about local government I would encourage you to not believe the old saying that councils are all about roads rates and and rubbish they're three hours you that um we are bird I think at the last counts we we counted that we actually provide more than 100 different services it's very hard to list them I was trying before but we're talking youth services senior services disability services building inspections health services economic development computer classes english classes migrant services parks playgrounds fitness pools and then if you go at a higher level of course we're talking housing strategic planning heritage traffic parking and so on um so um the pandemic in fact um called it and it was a great test and just a good example of how essential our work is in our communities you know we we continue to provide our services on the ground almost 24 7. we set up support relief programs for people in need you know for hygiene and food packs and we activated a system to basically help homeless people find accommodation within 48 hours in partnership with state government wesley mission we created programs for kids at home we set up a call system to check in with seniors and and people that were the same again in these two weeks hoping that it's limited to two weeks and and so that's a brief summary from me and and I probably leave it at that but I hope you can sense the passion that I have for local governments and for bird council in particular um and I just like to conclude by saying this you know whatever happens with the elections um I hope and I encourage you to to feel confident that we have a great organization that is passionate about one thing and one thing only and that is providing the the best possible service to to our community uh regardless of of politics on council we we are employed as an organization to to work for the community and and so um probably leave it at that I hope in one way or another that I'll be able to meet with you personally in person uh at some stage and um to work with you uh on on this future journey for burwood so thank you for having me and um I wish you all the best I'm sure that well I hope that people will follow up your invitation and chat with you as they continue to pursue a consideration of running for council thank you very much so I'm going to move now through the slide deck and I'm just going to turn off my video because you don't need to be looking at me while we do that just bear with me right I'm hoping that everyone can see the slides and please use the chat function to let us know if you're experiencing any problems and we will do what we can to ensure that um everybody has a good experience and and hears this information clearly so to kick us off I'll just give you a quick overview of what we'll be covering during this session tommaso has already given us um something of an um introduction or or reminder about what's happening in the local government area from a council perspective then we'll be talking about the role of local government specifically then considering what the roles and responsibilities are of the general manager in the staff team we'll have a look at the legislative framework for local government uh there's quite a a deal of legislation that you know imposes requirements and sets expectations for what happens within the local government context and particularly for the governing body the elected council we'll talk about council decision making some of the skills and attributes that would be helpful helpful for you to bring to the role or to acquire as you're in the role should you succeed in your candidacy or discuss some of the challenges and rewards of public office and the support that's available to councillors who are elected to enable them to undertake their roles for some reason we have challenges and rewards twice on the slide I apologize for that and then we'll wrap up there'll be an opportunity for you to ask some questions and uh we'll finish by circulating a quick feedback form to get your thoughts about whether um you know whether you've got out of today's session what you hoped when you registered information about the burwood local government area I'm sure you're all familiar with the geographic extent of the local government area but this map helps to just confirm where the boundaries are and you'll you'll see that inner west and strathfield and canada bay councils uh surrounding burwood council and take up some of the other suburbs that might be you know just down the road from where you are but are actually not part of the burwood local government area so in total the local government area covers about 7.26 square kilometers and has a current estimated population of about 41 000 people but the state government's projections um at least immediately before the covert pandemic and I guess we're still to see what the long-term effects of that might be but the projections that the state government's demography unit had for the local government area were that over the next 20 years the population could continue to grow to up to around 75 000 so a really significant increase from what's currently in place and as tomaso mentioned that provides of people will mean an interesting approach to thinking about how housing development might occur you know the density of housing the types of housing mixes and that kind of thing these are all the sorts of challenges that um that councils face in their long-term planning to ensure that those future needs are met as well as the needs of the current community um as tomaso mentioned there's more than 65 percent of residents in your local government area speak a language other than english at home that's not to say that they don't also speak english but that's a high level of community languages being spoken that that as we discussed earlier need to be taken into consideration when community engagement is happening with between council and the community um the way that that we deliver services and so on the state government has the greater sydney commission as I'm sure many of you are aware of and and that commission divides the greater sydney area into distinct districts and burwood council sits within the eastern city district and there's a state specific objectives to achieve for the burwood area so some of the things that are recognized in that plan are that the dining and nighttime precincts that exists within burwood um probably a bit quiet at the moment but generally recognized to be a significant precinct for that nighttime economy and the strategic center for public transport investment that was mentioned earlier but by your key location between the city of sydney and the second sydney city of parramatta there's a range of other sydney and state government initiatives that have a bearing on the burwood local government area um there was a mention before about increasing green spaces within the within the local area and the greater sydney green grid is a state government initiative to to connect up green spaces across the sydney metropolitan area and see the great the green spaces that are created in in the burwood area will contribute to that greater sydney green grid as was mentioned um burwood council is comprised of seven councillors which includes a popularly elected mayor and uh within council there are um there's an organizational structure and uh five directorates that sit um to you know to organize the organization under under the general manager so the five directorates are currently community life city assets corporate services people and performance and city strategy and so within those directorates there's a key focus on the on the specific issues that that part of the organization will will look after on behalf of council and to the community council laws and other other people across the council also contribute to or sponsor a number of community technical and industry committees and um council's website describes all of those committees and the the notes that you receive following this presentation will include a link to a lot of the different websites and resources that we discussed during this presentation as with most organizations council has a stated mission which is to create a quality lifestyle for its citizens by promoting harmony and excellence in the delivery of council service the the way that council operates is shaped by some key corporate and community documents that set out the strategic direction for the community and that's referred the burwood 2030 document and from that community strategic plan council derives or creates a a series of other documents that guide council to deliver its services and and allocate its resources over the term of each incoming council so following this local government election in september a new delivery program and resourcing strategy will be developed in consultation with the incoming council to determine how best to continue to deliver services and allocate available resources to ensure that the community's objectives are met in the in the most efficient and effective way in 2021 the budget of council showed an operating revenue of 57 million and 49 934 with an operating expenditure of 54 million 291 800 dollars um its capital works program for that same 2020 2021 period was valued at almost 16.4 million and tommaso talks through some of the capital works items that are being invested at the moment the pools and and so on councils also doesn't work alone in in the area there's a number of neighboring councils that together form what's known as ss rock or southern sydney region network of local government councils that um you know help to shape and and determine uh strategic direction for for that part of sydney at the moment um bird is exceedingly active on on on the regional organization of councils with the mayor being the chair of that organization um as we speak um the the regional organization of councils takes a collaborative approach to addressing community issues such as waste management street lighting improvements renewable energy and pest animal management so those sorts of issues that extend beyond the borders of the local government area so that gives you along with tommaso's introduction a bit of a an overview about the local government area that council is responsible for so when we think about local government um it's important to remember that it sits in a broader government context and so obviously we're all familiar with the federal and state layers of government as well but there's very different and sometimes overlapping responsibilities across those levels or spheres of government so the diagram on this slide gives us a bit of a sense of uh occasions when local government might find itself being a you know a very loud advocate for the local community to other levels of government at other times uh what's called cost shifting might occur where a different sphere of government imposes upon local government responsibilities sometimes with little notice and not much consultation um that that the local government is then required to pick up and and be responsible for and so um again local government has that role of advocacy to to push back on behalf of the local community to say uh that perhaps this isn't how we would like to invest our you know rates and revenue we want to concentrate on other matters that are important to our local community um there are constraints about the limits to what a local government council can make decisions about given this um I suppose layered approach of responsibilities across the three spheres of government and so it's important that if you're considering running for local government and your driven by a particular issue that's motivating you to want to stand for public office something that can be addressed or solved or in some way influenced at a local government level um it may be more appropriate to direct your attention to a different level of government if the issue is outside the realm of local government's responsibility so it's just helpful to have a clarity about those different spheres of government and the different responsibilities that they have we have a look a bit more closely than at the role of local government uh tomas I mentioned that there's about a hundred different services at least that burwood council delivers in in its community and some if not all of the ones described on this diagram here may be included in in that list of burwood council service delivery however not all councils deliver exactly the same thing and so to find out exactly what your local council is delivering then I would always point you to the current delivery program and operational plan which can be found on council's website which describes in detail the the types of services and and activities that council undertakes and also in of um budget that's being allocated to achieve those activities and services so as I said some councils will do more or less of some of these in some communities there'll be a range of other service providers who might pick up some of those functions and in other communities council may be the primary service provider in in the absence of other organizations to pick up those responsibilities so as I said refer to the burwood delivery program and operational plan and you'll see exactly what burwood council is delivering and its role in the local community so what are the roles and responsibilities of the governing body and the governing body in in a council is the elected council the seven people who are elected to be burwood council the role of the government body and the responsibilities are described very clearly in the local government act which is one of the primary pieces of legislation which informs the local government environment and the collective responsibility of the governing body as a whole sits beside the individual responsibilities of each councillor and we'll discuss the governing body are related to the development implementation monitoring and review of a suite of documents that we will refer to as the integrated planning and reporting framework that sits within the local government act and this integrated planning and report reporting framework is is um a group of documents plans and reports that you will become quite familiar with um when when if you become part of the council so a key important function of the council is to ensure that the organization as a whole acts in accordance with those plans programs strategies and policies and to determine a rating and revenue policy that optimally allocates the available resources to achieve the most sustainable outcomes for the community obviously a key role of the the elected bodies to provide that civic leadership being elected to public office is a leadership role and as a council it's that community civic leadership that is um a key role of of the governing body and it goes without saying that a primary responsibility to is to act in accordance with the legislation and we'll just discuss that a more roles and responsibilities of the governing body are to review council's performance and again this is around ensuring that what was promised through the adopted plans and budget and so on is being delivered in the way that was expected and ensuring that if there are deviations from that agreed direction that decisions are made to adjust that direction in a way that's sustainable and still meets the community's expectations and needs a very important function you could say the most important function of the governing body is to make decisions and that sounds um maybe a bit strange but in fact it's the primary thing that the elected governing body does in its legal function as a as a as a council is to make decisions to pass resolutions about uh what will happen um in relation to a whole range of matters that will come before the council to make decisions about the one staff member that the governing body has responsibility for appointing is the general manager and but in consultation with the general manager to determine the organization structure and that but determining the the structure for which those senior roles will have responsibility so I mentioned earlier in the discussion that the council has five key directorates so the decision to organize council's activities under those five directorates would have been determined with by the general manager and the governing body as uh the best way forward the general manager then has responsibility and may delegate to others within other staff within the organization for employing the people that sit within those roles and everybody else who comes within the staffing structure of the council another function of the governing body is to consult with the community and and other key stakeholders and the staff will be important um I suppose informants to that process where they will help to define the um occasions during which community consultation will be necessary the types of consultation that are required the sorts of questions that consultation uh seeks to answer and also the the methodology that consultation will occur within in response to the needs of the community and stakeholders that are being consulted with but the council laws will have from the community what the issues and needs and desires might be obviously as as we mentioned in the previous slide about acting in compliance with the law there's a requirement that all all elected officials act honestly and efficiently and appropriately and in doing so don't do anything that will bring council into distribute and it's very important to note that the council laws don't have a an operational level function it's very much a strategic governing body board of direction board of directors if you like sort of function the operational day-to-day decision making is made through the general manager and the staff and the general manager will liaise with the governing body to ensure that um the direction and and uh activities of council's affairs are done in alignment with the strategic directions set by the governing body so that was that was a summary of the governing body as a whole the elected council as a whole but there are responsibilities that the local government act describes for individual councillors as well so you may remember I said there was there's a requirement to be active and to contribute it's not enough just to turn up to a council meeting but but it's very necessary to have read all the the business papers to come in informed and ready to make decisions and to actively contribute to debate and discussion that enables sound decision making to occur the ipr integrated planning and reporting that I mentioned earlier which is that suite of plans and reports that help to guide the the direction of council to determine the priority of resource allocation and so on it's very important that individual councillors take responsibility to participate in the development of those documents and there will be opportunities particularly around the development of the delivery program and the resourcing strategy which are the way that council commits to the activities that will be undertaken over the term of office of the council there'll be opportunities to participate in those processes that it's very important that all counsellors you know participating actively as an individual counselor there are responsibilities about representing the collective interests of the community so for a particular you know on behalf of a particular group of people who are your supporters once you're elected you're there to represent the entire community and so while you may still have an interest in those specific issues that brought you to stand for public office once you're on the council it's necessary for you to consider the needs of the entire community and make decisions that are in the best interests of the whole community a key function of council is is to facilitate communication with the community um people often will stop counsellors in the street or down in the supermarket and and have a chat about the things that they're concerned about because they recognize that that a counsellor is uh you know their representative to the local government and it's uh important then that the the mechanisms that are in place that are established by the council for council laws to feed back ideas information issues and complaints and compliments as well around the things that community members pass on to them there's that that facilitating that of individual council laws it's also an important responsibility of counsellors to acquire and maintain the skills that are necessary for them to undertake the role and we'll discuss later about the support that's available for councillors to do this but it's also very important that council laws have some I guess insight into their own um strengths and the areas that might require further development so that they can actively uh define as part of their learning and development plan the sorts of things that they'd like to build more skills in and and or retire you know develop further the skills that they might already have and then the final point on this slide is around being accountable to the community for council's performance ultimately we've we've referred to this notion of council being a board of directors and just as a board of directors this account is accountable to its shareholders for the investments that shareholders make so to is the elected council and individual councillors responsible for the um you know sound investment of of ratepayers money of the very best outcomes are achieved for the community best value for money and you know most efficient ways of delivering those services to be accountable and transparent in the way decisions are made to achieve those outcomes so I'm just going to spend a moment now to talk about the role of the general manager because sometimes there's confusion about the difference between that strategic role of the counselor and the more operational functions of the general manager through to the to the staff of the organization and the local government act generally refers to the general manager when when it when it refers to staff generally because it assumes that the general manager will have in place you know a senior executive layer of support people and other staff under that who will who may be delegated with some of these functions but ultimately the the buck stops with the general manager for the operational day-to-day management of the council as we mentioned earlier the council one of the primary functions of the elected council is to make decisions and so following each council meeting when for implementing those decisions in a timely manner the general manager is responsible for preparing with in consultation with the council the community strategic plan the community engagement strategy resourcing strategy delivery program operational plan and annual report and other reports as as required by the local government act the general manager is responsible for advising the elected council about the implementation of those plans and the strategies and the policies of council and ensuring that where it's appropriate and necessary that the appropriate form of community engagement has been undertaken the general manager has responsibility for ensuring that the mayor and councillors are given information that they need in a timely way that will inform their capacity to make decisions and support them to effectively discharge their functions as council laws the local government and other acts provide for some functions of the council to be delegated to the general manager and when council has made those delegations then the general manager is required to exercise those functions the general manager as we mentioned earlier is responsible for appointing staff in accordance with the organisational structure that's tommaso will recruit all of those staff but we'll delegate to appropriate people in the organization to undertake that recruitment in order to meet the requirements of council within the resources that are available and likewise the general manager is responsible for directing the staff to do work in a particular way and and ensure that the work undertaken by staff is in line with those agreed strategic directions and um adopted delivery program an operational plan and resourcing strategy and and to dismiss staff if that's ever necessary the council's workforce management strategy uh describes how council will best utilize its workforce to ensure that the optimum outcomes of of the plans of council are achieved and the general manager has responsibility for ensuring that that workforce strategy is implemented in accordingly and as I mentioned there there may be functions either delegated or required through the local government act or other legislation that are imposed on the general manager for delivering on behalf of council so I've mentioned now the local government act and other legislation on a few occasions but that's because are very key documents in policy documents legal the legal framework that really outlines and describes what local governments must do how they must do it the restrictions and constraints that apply but also the the opportunities that exist within that legal framework but beyond the local government act there's a whole lot of other legislation some which is very specifically targeted at local councils and others which capture local councils in their in their net if you like so a key piece of legislation that you're possibly familiar with even if you didn't realize that this is what it was called is the environmental planning and assessment act which essentially provides the legislative framework for all of those kind of town planning development application kind of functions that council has responsibility for two other pieces of legislation which primarily our council uh council documents uh the companion animals act and the swimming pools act which um require councils to look after cats and dogs and you know registration and desexing and those kinds of things in the sense of ensuring that um there's not lots and dogs are managed in the in the community and similarly with the swimming pools act it's to do with you know private swimming pools backyard swimming pools swimming pools that are in you know motels and um other accommodation providers and ensuring that they are safe and preventing primarily preventing small children from coming to grief in in those swimming pools but other legislation that applies to a whole range of organizations and government agencies and where local government also gets caught up uh things like the gipper act which you might have reheard of people still think of it as the freedom of information act but it's actually called the government information public access act there's obviously things like work health and safety where we ensure that not just staff but others who come into the environment are kept safe and healthy in that space disability inclusion act crown land management act the roads ash there's privacy act there's a whole range of legislation that council needs to be aware of and comply with often has a reporting requirements associated with it and I guess oversight about the types of legislation that the organization is um obliged to comply with that that sort of state government and sometimes federal legislative framework that applies is then supplemented or complemented by council's own policy framework and some of these are requirements uh set out in the local government act but um but others are required just sensible governance issues that ensure that everybody approaches these questions with a consistent approach and there are clear expectations about what is and isn't acceptable so council policies include a code of conduct which applies not just to council laws but to council staff as well and often also applies to contractors and others who might work on behalf of of council from time to time there's a code of meeting practice which is a key document for helping to shape the way that councils council meetings are held and conducted so that they are effective and using um the time well uh that they're they're structured properly that they're respectful and so on we mentioned earlier about the support that's available that role and so the counselor expenses and facilities policy uh outlines the extent of that counsellor support the expenses that will be covered that's the facilities that will be provided and it's one of the early um tasks of an incoming council to review that policy and confirm it for the term of office of of that council there's another very important policy is the interaction between council officials policy the local government act is very clear that council laws don't have a right to direct council staff other than through the general manager and so the interaction policy is really about I guess protecting staff from inappropriate requests that are not happening in in the agreed uh way or through the correct channels it's very important for consistency for ensuring that decisions are in line with agreed decisions uh sorry direction is in line with agreed decisions that the council laws interaction is through the general manager and the general manager passes on those decisions to the staff um so that policy outlines the the requirements related to that obviously in this day coming unstuck particularly in the social media environment by making comments in what they think is a private way but becomes a public issue and the fact of a person holding public office and making a private comment that becomes public becomes quite um a messy place to be and so the media and social media policies of council provide very clear guidance about the types of activities that council laws can undertake in social media when they can and can't_''_3103.52 speak on behalf of council and the protocols that exist around around that media interaction there's also a conflicts of interest policy that is possibly self-explanatory but uh how it's very important that all of what council laws do the decisions that they make are very transparent and that there's no possibility that people can um imply that there was a conflict of interest in in that decision that people have benefited from a decision that they've made uh in a public um role and so that policy helps to make clear what is a conflict of interest and and how to you know corruption prevention is a an important governance uh issue in any any organization but in a in a government organization I think perhaps there's a an even higher expectation of of um behavior and what is appropriate and and fraudulent and corrupt what that looks like that that sort of behavior and so this prevention policy again puts in place of requirements that prevent fraud and corruption from occurring in the first place but also provide a framework for managing incidents where there's concerns that fraud or corruption might have occurred and the gifts and benefits policy uh you you would be surprised how often people would like to gift you something because they're very happy that a particular result has been achieved but they in public office there are some risks associated with that and you know I'm sure we all remember um the the premiere of the day barry o'farrell um gift of a bottle of wine that caused him to come unstuck and so the gifts and benefits policy help to shape and determine what is an appropriate gift to receive what know graciously refused so all of these policies help council laws and staff to undertake their role in a very transparent accountable and consistent way that complies with community expectations of what good governance and and public office entails as well as the policy framework that helps counsellors and staff to be clear about their role the council itself has a policy making function for the community and those community policies exist in the same way to to make very clear about the expectations for the community of you know using land or um sharing community spaces and and and how as a community we need to keep the environment uh clean and safe for everyone to use and so community policies that council makes um include all manner of things and some of them are listed here on this slide such as um you know parking policies around where you might have paid parking or timed parking disability parking those kinds of things um I won't go through the whole list but you can get a sense from that list about the breadth of of areas that council framework assists staff in their in when they exercise their functions if they're you know responding to a complaint about hoarding or responding to um a question about whether it's okay to have alcohol at a picnic in the local park um you know the these policy frameworks provide guidance and consistency in in in um providing that information to the community and taking action when necessary to ensure that uh the community safety and and amenity is retained through this policy framework well as we mentioned earlier the one of the primary functions of the elected body is to make decisions and the code of meeting practice and code of conduct that I mentioned earlier provide a really sound basis for decision making of the elected council the integrated planning and reporting framework also sets the decision-making context for the council during its term in office and very shortly after the election the council will be briefed on where the community engagement activities to inform the next round of integrated planning and reporting are up to what some of the emerging issues are where you know some that carry through essentially what the integrated planning and reporting framework sets out to do is to answer some four key questions it's it's about what where are we as a community now where are we as a council now what does our budget look like now who are we you know what sort of activities and services are we providing now and where would we like that to be in the future whether that's by the end of this council term by the end of the next decade it's it's about setting a bit of a strategic forward-looking um aspiration so that the decisions we make about how we'll how we will get from where we are now to where we want to be will be shaped to ensure that we meet those goals and aspirations and so the the integrated planning reporting framework sets that out in a both at a community strategic level and at a council delivery program level and then that's supported by an annual operational plan that describes the specific activities that will happen in that financial those community strategic outcomes so once that suite of plans is prepared and adopted by the incoming council uh ahead of july next year then from the first of july when the those that next suite of documents uh you know commences kicks off then the decision-making of council should be in relation to how the particular matter under consideration will achieve the things that have been committed to in those documents and how it will fit within the resourcing allocations described um within the budget and the re and the resourcing strategy more broadly and so the the ipnr framework integrated planning and reporting framework becomes a really important set of documents to inform council decision making during its term in office and as I've mentioned a couple of times now that the primary documents would be the delivery program which is essentially the incoming council's commitment about what it will deliver over the term of its office and the resourcing strategy which describes how all of the revenue that council receives and the human resources that it has at its disposal and the assets and infrastructure appropriately meet those delivery program commitments so um important documents for everyone in council but particularly the elected representatives to be very familiar with and also to contribute to the development of so that everybody's on the same page about you know the way forward and and and how we're going to get there all of these documents can be found on council's website and when we distribute the slides following this session you'll receive um the notes that are attached to the slides and and the links to each of the documents that we've been referring to so what does it take to become a counsellor this list of skills and attributes has been compiled from interviews with people um you know who have served as counselors in the past you know in a whole range of communities whether they're metropolitan hugely well resourced councils or little tiny rural and remote councils the skills and attributes that council laws require uh are pretty much consistent wherever um those people might be meeting and so um some of them it's worth just having listening are absolutely vital skills for anybody coming into this role then the requirement to listen to your peers listen to the community and then communicate what you're thinking and you know have that robust debate and discussion as part of the decision-making process uh vital um skills to have around the council table and along with that are those those skills of negotiation and problem solving and and willingness to work as part of a team because they're all part of that kind of communication and listening attribute having some patience you know I think often people stand for public office with a really strong motivation to get a particular thing done and that thing may well be able to be done over time but it won't necessarily happen immediately and nor may some other things that you feel passionately about maybe because uh when all is said and done there are simply not enough resources for those things to occur maybe because they're not really a role of local government and they sit more appropriately with another level of government or a different type isn't support for that particular thing that other issues are given more priority so patience is again something to bring to the table in order to to do the job well being organized and having good time management skills will be important there's particularly in terms of the amount of reading business papers reports and other information that's provided to help support decision making uh time management is a really important skill to enable that reading to happen because um you know there's some very important and high value decisions that could need to be made and if they're being made without doing um you know giving the decision due process by actually reading all the information that's been prepared to help support the decision making then then that's not you know that's not okay um we've already we've talked a bit already about that willingness to engage the community sometimes counselors tell me that they don't think that they need to have further discussions with the community because they've been elected to be the community's voice little bit true however we can never no matter how many people voted for us assume that we always know what those people will think about every item that's under consideration and so there's an ongoing responsibility to have conversations with the community to you know to check in and check the pulse of the community are we on the right track is this still a priority are people still concerned about this matter um or do they have a preference about you know option a or option b that's under consideration that we can't always know that two or three years down the track from the point at which we were elected so that ongoing conversation with the community is really important which brings me to that next point about a commitment to social justice principles and if you're unfamiliar with that um term what that means is uh ensuring that there's opportunities for people to have access and equitable opportunities to participate and and and rights to information um it to support their participation so social justice really ensures that we we community who needs access to a service or um wants to participate in decision making or uh you know there's there's equal opportunity for all of them to have that um interaction with the service provision or the engagement activity or whatever it might be being a counselor is hard work um there'll be late nights there'll be you know weekend work there'll be uh lots of papers to read into the wee small hours of the night um and so energy and motivation are important attributes to bring to the role and being a bit resilient you know having some personal emotional resilience and some broad shoulders sometimes the decisions of counsel won't be popular and regardless of how right you might know the decision to be in the sense that you're you're privy to all the information that's brought you to that decision uh there'll still be some pushback or some flack in the media or some complaints from your constituents and that requires some broad shoulders um that capacity to not take things personally to um understand give however you know it may feel personal and so just going in with open eyes about about that aspect of being in a public public facing role and and that also I guess um is linked to that to those attributes of confidence and assertiveness and it's important that uh you know counselors in their community engagement and other sort of public civic duty activities you know can stand up in front of a crowd of people and maybe say a few words or or just be present in community events and um other activities where there's a necessity to kind of assertively put put the position that you've been asked to put on behalf of council or to um you know speak confidently in front of a group of perhaps complete strangers another key attribute is the ability to think strategically we've mentioned several times during this presentation and I'll probably say it again before the end that the counselor role is very strategic high level function and not it's not down in the weeds as we sometimes say it's not job the counselors need to keep their gaze high you know it's that helicopter view um the big picture and so um you know having that strategic thinking capacity is actually quite a skill and there are things that you can do to build that skill if it's something that you've not um you know had much practice with before and then finally on this list is being empathic and and also having some advocacy skills so we talked earlier about listening listening is part of the role when we're talking about our constituents as well and so often we'll hear stories from constituents that um you know require just quiet listening being empathetic and perhaps advocating for that person whether it's about getting them housing or um helping them to navigate um a centrelink um process or uh whatever it might be or you know referring them to an appropriate service to get the support that they need um but that empathy and advocacy is is uh a important skill to bring to the to the role so what might some of the a couple of those in relation to the skill and and time is is a very important thing to be mindful of as I mentioned there's a lot of reading to do I don't know if you've seen a council business paper they're all available on council's website but they can run to hundreds of pages and it's a lot of information to to get through and have your head around in order to make an informed decision at the council meeting as well as reading the business papers there might be other preparation to do there may be briefings to attend uh community meetings to attend um and other just civic leadership roles that are outside the decision-making process so community events where between the councillors you'd sort of divvy up the things that you might go and put the council face to so all of that takes time and um finding a balance between those those council commitments and the rest of your life will take a little bit of you know working out sometimes a challenge is as I mentioned know you will occasionally make unpopular or difficult decisions and the decision might simply be to do nothing in the face of a request to do something but how however that is still a difficult decision and uh you you know you you are making that decision based on all of the evidence and the resources that are available um but nevertheless it may be unpopular and difficult and as a result you may receive some negative feedback as we've said before and often you'll be asked to consider and think about and make decisions that are about things that aren't of particular interest to you you know you might be standing as a counselor because you have a very strong interest in community service provision and the next thing you know you're being asked to make a decision about a road or a bridge and you know sometimes those things are less interesting to you however when you're part of the governing body all of those things matter and you need to have um you know make an informed decision about all of them as a counselor and and close to your community you know that that level of government that is most close to the community it serves people will approach you and want you to fix all manner of things many of things many of which won't be a local government responsibility and so one of the challenges will be about um you know sort of carefully referring those people to the more appropriate place to have their needs met or walking beside them in you know in a figurative sense to help them to get those needs met um but you won't be able to fix everything even though they might approach you with that uh thought um and then you'll have the challenge of balancing individual needs with community needs as a whole and so you might have a number of individual constituents come to you uh with quite pressing concerns that sound very you know important and and worthy of your attention however when you balance those with the needs of the community as a whole it may not be possible to address those individual needs in the community you know without setting some kind of um precedent that will be difficult to follow and so balancing those needs can be at times quite a challenge and when you join council if you're elected you essentially um you know join a group of people who might come from very different parts of the political or social or cultural spectrum have very different world views to you and suddenly you're throwing together with these people and expected to work together collaboratively to make decisions together on on behalf of the whole community and and again that can be quite challenging if you're coming with a very strong view about something that is quite different from others around the table um it's important to remember as a as a counselor unlike other levels of government there isn't um an opposition council is the is the government and and uh the opposition exists perhaps within the government rather than from a different part of you know from a different side of the chamber and so um finding that balance finding a way of as I said from different world views um will be an important thing to achieve early in in your time as a counselor if if you should become elected and and everybody who's been a counselor talks about initial very steep learning curve but that quite soon um and and incrementally over time and they'll become much more comfortable and confident in the role um with the support that's provided by the general manager and others within council and that very sound robust legislative and policy framework that makes it very clear what's expected and and where the support can can come from to to um assist in that in that learning so um you know be prepared for a steep learning curve at least initially but that quite soon you are very likely to feel much more comfortable in the role and that everybody around you is probably experiencing a similar steep learning curve but balanced against the challenges there's also of course rewards and the people who've been spoken to in the past about their experience of being a local government councillor able to give something back to their community they really value the opportunity to help to shape the local community's future through influencing the long-term vision and direction of the community and finding new ways of of utilizing the skills and expertise individually and bringing those to this communal place of of decision making on behalf of the whole community all of us of course bring quite unique perspectives to collaborative decision making and that's that's why we have this sort of democratic process of bringing people from across the community together to form the governing body it's a great opportunity to learn new skills including leadership skills and public speaking and and advocacy and not perhaps just to learn them but to practice them and develop them further even if it's something that you might have done in one way or another in your in your previous life and a great reward is to make decisions that you can see are having and making a real difference in the local community and that are helping people to achieve those aspirations and goals that have plan and elsewhere in the community it's a great opportunity to work with diverse and passionate people often people that you would otherwise perhaps not have very much to do with in your day-to-day life on a whole range of issues not just around the council table but across the staff team and with community and other stakeholders that you may work with as you're undertaking this role and it's also a great opportunity to show leadership and make decisions um you know that balancing the needs and priorities of the community and and doing that successfully can be a really great reward of being a counsellor so as I mentioned earlier you're not thrown in if you're elected you're not thrown into this new role in the deep end without some support for you to undertake the role and very early and we'll talk in a minute about some of the key dates but very early in following the election there'll be a formal induction process that will bring everybody onto the same page new and returning councillors to ensure that which we've touched on tonight but with a lot more detail about um the information or sort of a lot more detailed information about those requirements and that that policy and legislative framework that we've already discussed and then as I also mentioned earlier um there's an opportunity for ongoing learning and development and part of what will happen fairly early on in in your time as a counselor should you be elected is that with the general manager your developer learning and development plan that will support your ongoing acquisition of new skills you know opportunities to network with other counselors from other councils you know local government conferences and seminars and things like that that will be identified to help to support you in your role during your term in office uh local government is also councillors in local government are also remunerated for their for their um role and the remuneration for local councillors is set by the local government remuneration tribunal which is established by the state government so it's an independent sort of separate body that determines the remuneration for councillors different depending on the size of the council and whether it's a metropolitan or a rural regional council but for the burwidge council which is classified as a small metropolitan council the remuneration tribunal has set their rates for councillors to be a minimum of nine thousand three hundred and seventy dollars per annum adam to a maximum of twenty thousand six hundred and dollars per annum with the mayor receiving an additional minimum 19970 to a maximum of forty five thousand one hundred and ten dollars per annum and the actual rate within those parameters will be determined by council the um I've already mentioned about the expenses and facilities policy but there are a range of expenses that will be covered in facilities that will be provided that are articulated in that policy with limits to that expense um established which will as I said be reviewed and re-adopted by the incoming council early in its term and so that some of the facilities will include things like you know perhaps an electronic device or a mobile phone um access to an email address or um travel reimbursement if you have to attend something on behalf of council those kinds of things so essentially what it's saying is that you shouldn't be out of pocket for your um for taking on this this role and that the expenses that you accrue as part of the role will more often than not be covered by that expenses and facilities policy um we've already already mentioned that council has these codes of conduct code of meeting practice and a range of policies um which sound like this sort of big onerous you know group of documents that are there to scare us but actually they provide a really supportive framework to help everybody in the organization counselors and staff alike and indeed the public who were there to serve to be very clear about the expectations um as well as you know what might happen if people don't comply with those policies and codes what what consequences there could be so um it's very clear to everybody and that's quite you know most counselors find it very supportive to know that there as we've already mentioned on a couple of occasions now there's a suite of strategies and plans that council laws will uh participate in the development of but which help once they're adopted become a really um key strategic planning framework for which councillors will find a lot of support because it helps to to frame decision making and to be very clear about you know what the ultimate objective is of of the activities and and decisions that councillors um undertake and outside of the council context there's an industry peak organization called local government new south wales which exists primarily to support councillors to undertake their role but also to be a voice for council laws to state government for example in helping to set policy that is more reflective of the needs of local government and and so on so again another organization that's there to support counsellors in undertaking their role as I mentioned there's um early on in in the new council's life uh the council election as you I'm no doubt aware is on the 4th there'll be a full day induction that will really um allow councillors that are elected to hit the ground running um I really strongly recommend that if you're standing for election that you put these dates in your diary now so that um your you know you can plan around them and then when your candidacy has been confirmed or your your election to local to build council has been confirmed you can then take the steps you need to ensure that those dates are available to you um soon in that same week there'll be an extraordinary meeting of council where you will take the oath or affirmation you'll elect the deputy mayor and determine who which councillor will sit on which committees on behalf of council and there's also some other um uh legislative requirements like deciding on the count back if a casual vacancy occurs on the council within a particular time frame so that meeting is set for wednesday the 15th of september at six o'clock and then uh not terribly long later probably in the following week and hopefully induction will occur and that will cover off in more detail some of the things that we've covered very briefly in today's discussion and then the very first ordinary meeting of the new council where the business of council will really you know get going again will be on tuesday the 28th of september so as I said if you're if you're standing for council put these diaries in your dates in your diaries now and if you need to make arrangements around child care or um you know taking time off work have those conversations now so that at short notice if you discover that you were in fact elected you're able to attend um there's an expectation that all councillors will attend the induction and it's a requirement that you take the oath or or reformation at that first meeting so it's imperative that you attend that very first extraordinary meeting of council you can't undertake your council of duties until that has occurred so when nearly at the conclusion of the presentation um there's a lot of organizations to support people to make an informed decision about whether or not they'll stand for local government election the new south wales office of local government which is the state government's you know responsible department that looks after the local government portfolio has on its website a whole range of information about becoming a local government candidate the new south wales electoral commission and I'm sure you've already had a look there but if you haven't_''_5293.04 I suggest that you make yourself very familiar with that very quickly because there are a range of requirements for anybody standing for um for office that they meet pretty much from the moment you make the decision to stand so any expenditure you know if you're putting some flyers together and doing some printing if somebody gives you a donation to help you to pay for the printing all of that has to start being recorded and documented immediately so make sure you're familiar with those requirements um right now if you're not already I already mentioned that peak peak uh body the local um on its website to support elected representatives but also some information about standing for local government and of course burwood council's own website has lots of information that will help you to understand the council context that you're putting your hand up for some of those very important policy and planning documents annual reports that will give you a sense of where the council's um you know what how it's performed over the last few years and of course there's information about standing for this local government election on that website as well so as we reach the end of the formal presentation now is an opportunity if if there are questions that you came into the discussion uh with that haven't already been answered to to ask those using perhaps a chat function or we can maybe um move to uh talking to one another visually I'm just trying to find my here we go I'm back um michelle have we received any questions through the chat uh no we haven't yet um but if anyone wants to unmute obviously more than welcome to ask questions uh via the email address that you registered for and we can get back to you after the session with some answers um if you think of something after this this workshop has wrapped up um we really want this conversation that we've had tonight to be about helping you to make a very informed decision about whether you will stand for local government we hope that it's given you enough information that you can have a conversation with your family and your friends and others who you might need to call on to support you to undertake the role if you were successful so that you go in with open eyes and the people around you know what might be expected of them if you were to be successful and and become a counsellor I'm I've just got a downpour of rain on top of my head so I hope you can still hear me um a tin roof not very far above me and a lot of rain um so before we finish uh michelle will circulate just sent it lovely thank you a very quick feedback form to all of you who've registered uh we'd really appreciate if you could it's just four quick questions if you could just give us a quick amount of feedback about um whether today's session has kind of met your needs and any other feedback that you'd like to give us about the session we really happily appreciate um ideally we'd get you to do that right now while you're thinking about it but if you'd like to give it some more thought buy the clothes of business tomorrow we'll be shutting off that survey and and that will help us to understand how we can support future candidates um you know in future sessions uh the information as I've said earlier the information in today's presentation including some notes that will have a whole lot of um additional information from what was on the screen on the screen that you saw but also lots of website addresses and um you know references to other resources that can help be sent to you shortly and uh perhaps tomorrow morning if not this evening but soon and um I think that's all that I wanted to say so perhaps I could maybe quickly hand over to tomasso again just to um farewell you all and and um we wish you well in your in your candidacy but tommaso well thanks karen and um well done very very intense uh very comprehensive uh there's a lot to take take in I guess uh but as I mentioned before I just want to wish all the best to to those who are running for for build council so it's going to be a hell of a ride enjoy it and I hope to meet you in person in over the coming weeks so the best

Hi I'm kelly and welcome to chaga today's class is all about preparing you for a great night's sleep and before we begin just make sure that you've got a chair that has a sturdy back uh preferably with no arms and I'd love you to be able to get your feet flat on the floor and if that isn't possible then get some books or some yoga blocks so your feet are planted firmly on stability on uh some um on some ground um okay so our yoga practice is all about preparing you for sleep but there's some other things that you can do as well that's really going to help that so if you can if it's possible you want to lower the lights maybe have a lamp or a candle burning if you've got some lavender oil burning lavender is a nice way of preparing the body to calm and sleep make sure that you haven't had a big meal um a couple of hours at least before you go to sleep and try to absolute zero in okay so let's begin we're going to bring our hands together and we're going to start to rub them to bring some heat so we're activating the left and right sides of the body this input that output and just getting you nice and balanced so we'll take some deep breaths in here take some long exhales nice out through the mouth releasing your day releasing anything that you've been holding on to you want to just let that go now what's done is done okay let's press the hands into the body so we're going to place one hand on the heart area and one hand on the hara it's the lower abdominal area below your navel and here we start to take some nice deep breaths in and out of the nose and mouth we'll do a four seven eight breath to help click you in to rest mode so it's an inhale for the count of four holding your breath for seven and exhaling out through the mouth for eight inhale for hold for seven exhale for eight one more round inhale for four hold for seven exhale for eight gently bring your arms down by your sides inhale lift the arms all the way up take the deepest breath in you can and side out as your arms come down by your sides if your side comes out much louder than buying them that's absolutely perfect we're breathing out the day so take a big inhale sound it out ah we'll do one more lovely take a big inhale squeeze your shoulders exhale pull them back and down inhale squeeze them up breathe out take them back and down one beautiful bring your hands into an in place or if you can't um if you can't reach the sides of your head you can of course have the fingertips perhaps touching but you're going to start to squeeze your head and you're going to find that the side of the head is where we want to find any tension so your hands will naturally feel out dips where your heels of your hands get the top area of the sides and then work your way around more towards the face more towards the back and just squeezing your hands towards one another so you're squeezing your head a head squeeze making sure that your shoulders are still very soft that your breathing is long and deep and if you find any areas that feel quite sore or tight feel free to just stop here and place just gentle pressure and breathing we release any tension that we're holding in the head help to release facial muscles and then keep moving around to find the next achy bits maybe back behind the ears I'm still using the heels of my hands to find any areas that are small and tight then we're going to move when you're ready your fingertips to the occipital area it's where your skull meets your neck and it's usually a bony ledge but sometimes we can be really tight in there and and it's just all tight muscles so just judge where you think uh your ledge is but anywhere that just you can't_''_403.759 do this wrong you're feeling around and just scrubbing with your fingertips any areas that feel tight and sore and this scrubbing is just bringing gentle circulation to the muscles to encourage it to release and let go when our head is tight of thoughts and thinking or worries it's very hard to sleep it's very hard to sleep when our muscles are tight so a yoga practice and deep breath before we go to sleep is very very helpful so again we're just finding any areas that feel a bit small tight and then we'll go into massaging our ears and we're gently kneading the ears noticing where there's any tightness any aching feel free to do one ear at a time take your time remember your breathing's long and deep breathe right down to the belly right up to the chest breathe out through the mouth if you feel like you're holding onto tension or you're feeling a bit impatient nice slow rhythmic breath let's bring the hands around the neck like a of the occipital area where the skull meets the neck so I've got some support and I'm imagining the top of my head has a pin and I'm drawing a circle on the ceiling and my circles are small to start with as I start to just notice what my muscles in my neck are like today I don't want to be throwing myself around I just want to gently encourage and create circulation through the muscles to help relax and let go change direction when it feels comfortable and maybe my circles can get a little bit bigger only if it feels okay and I am putting a little bit of pressure around the sides of my neck to just give my neck that beautiful support that it might need it's been carrying my head all day and then we'll come back to center taking a hand across the body and just giving the top of my shoulder a nice big squeeze so we've got a big ropey muscle up here and it's a great idea to kind of grab as and squeeze it up it's almost like we want to just pull that muscle up carry it off like a bag so we want to pull it up and squeeze and if your muscles up here are quite tight it might be difficult to lift that muscle that's okay we're going to work with what we've got and then we're going to squeeze squeeze squeeze please squeeze breathe in and breathe out let it go so your hands are going to get a nice workout as well squeeze squeeze breathe in breathe in breathe in breathe out let it go we'll do it one more time before let's have a little shake out just notice that feel a little bit more comfortable a little bit more relaxed even just a little bit more well done great job we're going to squeeze the other side get a really good grip on that muscle squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze breathe in breathe in breathe in breathe out let it go and again squeeze and big squeeze beautiful and again just have a little notice we're giving our upper arms a little a little bit of a outside like how you would warm yourself up so just warming or rather stimulating circulation along the triple energizer channel this is the outside edge of us that connects us to the outside world I just want to brush off the day and then we're going to come down to the inside of our elbows where our elbow crease comes I want you to put your thumb here and just give a little massage now you can feel around the inside of that elbow and notice if there's any point that feels tender or a little sore and if that's the case go there and just make gentle little circles a little bit of pressure over this pressure point if you can't find any areas that feel sore or tight just that general area just in between where the wrist crease ends and your bony protrusion here just in between those two is a great place to aim your massage so a couple more breaths here as we massage and this is an we'll go over to the other side just finding first that area the outside or the end of your wrist crea sorry your elbow crease to where that bony little protrusion is so it's in between there right in the middle there but if it's not sore you might find that your point is maybe up the arm a little bit more or below the arm a little bit I just want you to find where it's small for you and gentle I don't want you to kill yourself here with pain I want you just a nice gentle massage and breathing deep deep breath here and relaxing the shoulders a couple more breaths one more deep breath and let's release you're gone for a nice little side stretch so if it's possible to take the arm up and over please do if it's not okay for you to do that just bring your arm or your hand into your chest and we can just open so where I want you to feel it it's just an upper body stretch get a nice little uh stretch we don't have to feel it in the hip and I certainly don't want you to topple over to the floor just want you to feel that arm nice and long all tucked in and open up this top side area hold here take a couple of deep breaths I like to take my hand to the opposite leg and I just hook my fingers around if I can reach it gives me a little bit more support if you can't reach just here on your knees fine take one more deep breath relax the chin in towards the throat and we can release let's go to the other side so it's just this top area we want to imagine opening breathing feet are planted on the ground just breathe gently shoulders are both soft pull them down one more breath chin's tucked in so the back of the neck is holding no tension at all and then we can release we're doing a lung sway and it's a beautiful way of calming down the whole we can gently let go surrender to sleep so we're just bringing the arms up at a comfortable height and we're just swinging or twisting from side to side and again it's just the upper body upper body breathing close your eyes down if that feels good or pick a point on the floor if you're feeling a little bit giddy you're just breathing naturally in and out through the nose a couple more we'll come back to center when you're ready and just wrap your arms around your body like you're giving yourself a beautiful big hug and gently pulling the chin into the throat without dropping ourselves all the way down it's just the upper body that is so from the base of the shoulder blades up really opening up through the upper organs the heart the muscle around the heart the lungs and as you draw your chin into your throat we begin to get quite a strong stretch into that the upper thoracic upper vertebrae into the cervical into the neck bones I'm just gently breathing course you can soften out you want to be able to maintain your breath feel the back of the body the back upper back expanding as you inhale and as you breathe out you're softening through your shoulders if it's comfortable for you to stay here please do otherwise we can continue down we drop our arms down into a spinal roll lowering the whole body down pulling the chin in towards the throat so our lower back gets a beautiful stretch as well when we're down here take a few deep breaths feel free to rub the tops of your feet and then you can either roll yourself back up again using your core strength or you can use your hands to walk yourself up your legs coming back to a neutral position we'll do that one more time so we cross our arms you can cross them the other way this time give your body a nice big hug pull the chin in around the upper back take a couple of deep breaths here if you're happy to stay here please do and you're going to take the arms down towards the floor head upper back mid back lower back nice stretch keeping your sitting bones or your bottom buttocks on the chair if you can reach your feet you can gently warm the tops of the feet or encourage circulation the tops of the feet nice pressure points at the top here to help relieve stress and then you can gently pull the chin in so you're not holding any tension in the neck either roll up or walk yourself back up shoulders head is the last to come up take a big breath in roll your shoulders exhale draw them down we've got two options for the next one we can either pick up a foot and rest it on top of your other thigh and our hands come to the heart our top of our head or our middle point in between our eyebrows meet the middle fingers of your fingers and we're the middle finger of your hands and we're holding here and breathing you can if you like come forward resting on your this is not really comfortable for you and not your thing today then we're going to come into warrior two so we take the leg out the other knees pointing straight ahead and our hands can come back into prayer and head comes to fingertips and you're going to stay here and breathe we're aiming for three breaths in each position slow deep breaths right down to the belly right up to the heart our fingertips moving into the third eye point help to move us to that center part of our brain calming the mind and when you've done three breaths you can release take a little rest a little pause in between just feeling the center or imagining you residing in the center of your brain right down the center line into your hara just below the navel let's move to the other side so the uh this side you may not be able to you may be able to do it our sides our left and right sides are very different from one another so please go slowly so our first position you're going to take your leg out to the side of your chair so you're in warrior two hands come to prayer fingertips to the third eye yin tame point calming tension deep breaths two more breaths here and when you're ready releasing take your left foot around the front of your right foot and take your right hand to the outside of your left knee the other hand behind you so we're doing a crossover of the lower body crossover of the upper body we're breathing in and we're breathing out little twist lift up and lengthen through the spine use your hand on your thigh or knee and your hand on the chair behind you to gently pull you around a little bit more now your eyes are soft and even if you can you can close your eyes down and focus into that third eye point that we were putting pressure on with our fingers it's a soft gaze between the eyebrows as you breathe as you lengthen the spine as you gently stretch the side of the neck in let's feel the back resting into the chain switch legs so whichever one was it now goes behind so the right foot in front the left hand across the body other hand on the chair let's lengthen the spine breathe in breathe out and twist a little bit of pressure on the leg a little bit of lifting through the spine close your eyes down focus on your third eye point and in twists I always like to just turn my mouth up into a very small smile this helps to alkaline the body it helps to soften the muscles so we can move into our twist a little bit more which encourages circulation and release of tension keep gazing softly into the third eye point and let's gently release and sink back into your chair if possible we can start to rub the soles of the feet together if it isn't you can use one foot on the inside of your calf and then you can change and do the other or you can pick your feet up and do a little rub and you and I want you to get really comfortable now into your chair for our last breathing meditation before you close your eyes and prepare to sleep so it's a humming breath and we're closing our eyes and placing our hands over the eyes and we're gently closing our ears that ear flap in your ears we're closing it up so all we can hear is our hum so it's an inhale through the nose and it's an exhale hum so our lips may get a little bit tingly so we three times we inhale until all the breath is gone shoulders are soft take a big breath in teeth but gently closed and you may feel the humming through the teeth as well when you've done three come into your rest pose slumping back into your chair the humming breath is a beautiful breath to do before you sleep at night and feel free to do another few rounds of that if it feels good for you it really does help turn the mind off and to prepare the body asleep that that extended exhale softens and relax your sleep bring your hands together at the heart bow the head take a long breath in ah thank you everyone sleep well

Hello my name's Harry Gabrielle some of the manager of environment will at burwood Council just want to tell you about an initiative we put together to assist our environmental health officers in the field and carrying out their health inspections the initiative that we have put together is aimed at streamlining the inspection process and also reducing risks associated with the process as well it's all based around our iPads which have now been issued to environmental health officers the first thing that we did was to engage through our IT section a program that has what we call mobile forms so the health inspection forms that we usually had it as paper-based forwards before and now all on the iPad we've been able to lay all our premises food shop premises onto the ipad and by going to a particular address wherever that might be we can log in and begin the inspection process so the form will then come up and the first part of the form is all about details of the operator and the proprietor and we need to make sure they do any further thing rhythm but we initially sit down with the shopkeeper go through all the details make sure that all the details are correct including phone numbers as we go through our inspections we have the general requirements about the premises and the notification to ensure that they're all compliant with the scores on doors which we've also implemented this will give us an automatic reading at the end of the process to notify to say what sort of ranking they will get as we go through the inspection process we check all the events as part of that summary and then when we have reached the end of it the program will give us an automatic score which will tell us whether they're five-star restaurant four-star restaurant of three-star restaurant or no great if there are significant issues with the premises part of the process again is we write down the officer's name who carried out the inspection and there is a feel there just to put in a signature which done electronically again we also have a facility on the iPad where and we asked them if they wish to pay there and there on the spot or if they wish to pay it later there's no compulsory requirement that they have to pay it there and then but at least we know they've got the invoice and they're aware that they have to make the payment to the council but all in all it's bringing together all those particular issues and complexities that are involved in food inspections to a point where it can all be done in the field by the Environmental Health Officer without needing to come back to the office to check an abscess number or to look up an avian number or to request a payment and we believe that it will be rolled out to other areas of the council including building and compliance areas but we think it's the way of the future and it brings together typing up if you particular function that we carry you you
As a day for me is a time of remembrance for all the sacrifices and all the effort that all the soldiers went through an anzac day all those years ago 99 years ago now and all the sacrifices they made for us today so that we could be here Anzac Day is a day where we remember all the men and women that fought died and paid many sacrifices to protect and defend our wonderful country the freedom we enjoy and the way we live on the morning of April twenty-fifth nineteen fifteen Australian and New Zealand troops landed under fire at Gallipoli and it was then in the violent campaign which followed that Anzac tradition was forged each year we pay how much not only to those original anzacs but to all who served and died for this country and jacquees to me of a time of reflection to the soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice to serving my country needs me remember the intact legend this is beautiful to say that country one of my great uncle's my family to wear this uniform was pride and this is worthwhile this is how we get together and I think particularly as an Australian they've actually learned so much to bond together to show great initiative and I think to learn responsibility of what you do in service we spoke with some of the diggers here today and now we were able to provide us with some stories and tell us about the times that they had back in the army and it's very interesting to hear all the things they had to say and they taught us a few things as well about the kinect unit both my grandfather's served in the First World War in Belgium and France and my maternal grandfather my mother's father he was in the field artillery here is the dead man's penny that was sent back to my grandmother's and which is engraved with my grandfather's name name on it and also the letter from King George the fifth appreciation for their service they're also two books one for each family which has all the soldiers who served in World War one names book it's about this eh hm both Maccon others before so there's a lot of memorabilia that we're fiction I treasure our hand on 12 children the Anzac legend is of utmost importance as it remains one of the defining moments in our nation's history the Battle of Gallipoli marks the emergence of the Australian identity the values of the Anzac legend respect honor and make ship create a moral fabric for our nation which is important to promote amongst young people although my generation is now 100 years removed from the tragedies through this experience I have now developed a personal responsibility to share the Anzac and World War one legends in order to keep our local stories alive I would like to call upon the younger members of our community to adhere today to lead by example and share the values espoused by our db's with their peers as the younger generation of Australians it is up to us to keep this legacy alive the uniform wearing today is something that we can wear because of the Anzac commemoration we are as part wear the uniform with pride they shall grow not old as we that are left grow old age shall not weary them nor the years condemn but the going down of the Sun and in the morning we will remember them unless we forget

My role is to head the cleaning and the waste services departments we have at council I do it with um 12 men good work as they are out in the streets early in the morning cleaning the streets and also the garbage trucks that go around picking up the area cleanups and the big tidy bins out there we do it in the early hours because it's a safe time to do it and we love our jobs and we love the time that we start working the time we get home to our families 32 years a good 32 years that's for sure in that 32 years I've had many changes on council I've I've been team leader I have been just the lowest worker on the council with mower I've worked myself up by getting training at tech colleges and here I am today sitting as waste and waste services and cleaning coordinator of bird council planning department I'm proud to be ahead of that ah the jobs changed enormously checks and balances are one thing that's for sure occasions you'd have people come up to you and they'd praise you for doing that and they'd offer your water and it was you know it was a good time we weren't wearing shirts or or sun cancer shirts back then days quite often we were in singlets but we liked our jobs the guys that did it also it's changed electronically whereas we had paperwork to do no paperwork anymore it's computers and we are time frames the area cleanups they have a week to be done they need to be off the street by the end of that week or we're behind schedule I've had two that definitely made me feel uncomfortable the first one was that a person walked out while I was doing a cleanup and offered me 20 to remove a tv well the job itself is done for free there's no cost to them I just have to remove the tv but the tv was large so I had to get someone in to give me a hand and the lady come up that offered me a second time saying here take the twenty dollars and put it in my top pocket well I needed a hand with the tv and another worker came along and we lifted it lifted the tv off the footpath and into the truck tv's gone I done my job but I felt uncomfortable with that twenty dollars I put it back in the letterbox and I made someone look to make sure that I'd done it I felt really uncomfortable taking that money or having that money put in my pocket because I didn't take it so after that I just moved on to my next next job but I did report it I had to report it to my manager and I reported it also to the ombudsman I think I emailed the ombudsman that day to say what had happened and went through the steps that had happened that night at home I i felt uncomfortable at home myself it's not something that um I get often but it's something that you know puts me off a bit yeah my second um uncomfortable is that in our area cleanups we send out I put the letters out for the people saying how big the cleanup should be so I do that before I do the cleanups and I get two weeks notice anyway this cleanup I had was enormous 13 meters by 1.5 meters by one meters enormous it was anyway I've done my little bit which was take 1.5 cubic meters away but I took two meters I take a little bit extra to be on the safe side so they can't argue that I didn't take enough well I done the same thing that day I took took my two metres of it and returned to my truck and a lady come across the road and she come across saying ah can you take the rest can you take the rest I explain the rules I said look in your letterbox inside your letterbox is the note saying that you've got an oversized cleanup and you're to remove it from the footpath I went back across the road to where I was working she came of crownies but anyway she put it down I asked the lady to remove the beer from the footpath and take it back inside a property on the third request she did she took took it back inside the property and I moved on that made me feel uncomfortable if I had accepted the beers that were offered I think that would have that would have put my reputation at risk at borrowed council something that I'm very proud of and also the reputation of bill council itself that um oh look at these guys look what they're doing taking money taking beers hopefully I won't have any more but if I do I'll be reporting them because I know that you'll have someone who'll listen and it's not a big deal to report something like that it actually makes you feel better to be quite honest ethical behavior I can hardly spell it tomorrow but um to me ethical behavior is doing the right thing doing doing the right thing yeah to me it's doing the right thing doing it the I got caught putting my hand in the lolly jar and once you get smacked once you never do it again but um ethical ethical is doing the right thing it's it's a feeling you get you know when it's right or wrong you want to do the right thing and when something becomes a bit easy you lean on the side of good you don't lean on the side of maybe I'll get away with it maybe I can do it it's that feeling that you get inside your heart that tells you yeah yeah yeah or no no no and it's a little thing in your head that at times it comes and goes you get that opportunity and you say no no no the job's more important yeah yeah I probably am a bit of a role model as a as a leader and as a minor manager you have to show the way um it's a good saying you know lead by example well I'm hands-on on the job people have they've heard about it beers and offering me money everyone gets around the yard and well maybe they they they'll think about that as well uh I i had a lot of things taken off my mind when that was done and it went through it was no big deal to do and I'm probably proud I did it in the end yeah

Thanks laura well premier gladys energy clan will meet with the mayors from sydney's 12 lgas of concern today after declining an online meeting last month they will discuss a range of topics of course including the easing of restrictions but we want to focus on areas such as burwood who only has 69 active covered cases joining me live now is the mayor of burwood john faker thanks so much for your time mayor what will you be telling and asking of gladys virgin clan today oh laura I'll be echoing the concerns that many of my residents have been speaking to me on a daily basis now um and I'll be telling her about the impacts of lockdowns and the impacts they're having on people in my community and the impacts on jobs local businesses people's mental health you know what we need to be focusing on and what the premier needs to be doing is giving people hope for the future and rewarding areas like build which have low covert cases and high vaccination rates well we're all getting rewarded together you talking about are you talking about burwood coming out of curfew not being declared as an lga of concern well exactly laura there's absolutely no reason why bill would should remain a hotspot area considering we only have 69 active cases so I'll be pleading to the premiere today for her government to take us off that list we've got adjoining councils that have nearly 400 cases and are not on the hotspot area so we need to yeah absolutely sorry to interrupt you john when you talk about curfews as well do you think there's now really a flimsy health reason to have them in place well it makes so it absolutely makes no sense that you have an area such as ours that's a hot spot area that has low covert cases but high vaccination rates for example let me ask you this why is it that we can go for a picnic for two hours um and if you're outside a hot spot area you can go for a bit for three hours so is it safe or not to these rules are ridiculous um you know it's upsetting and frustrating to our residents who are doing the right thing um who have stepped up and gotten vaccinated we've got nearly 80 of my community now um that they've had their first vaccination which are you know among the highest rates in the country so for vaccination rates so it makes no sense and I'm plenty on the premier to take us off the hot spot list and reward reward communities like bill that have done the right thing that have been complying with the covered restrictions and that are lifting those vaccination runs right so you want them essentially burwood to be in line with those areas outside of those 12 hot spot lga so people are fully vaccinated can have a picnic with five well exactly laura because you know it's starting to become very frustrating for residents they're starting to feel as if they're being discriminated against we're not against people for example in the eastern suburbs going to the beach or enjoying a picnic we just want to're getting in other areas considering we have those low coverage rates um and that we have very high vaccination rates so that the premium needs to give people hug give communities hope and reward communities that are doing the right thing do you accept that when we do get to 70 and the premier has said that once we do collectively all together we'll have these freedoms that she has talked about but if there are suburbs with really high case numbers and you see infections grow do you accept that some suburbs that might be your own will need to go into a lockdown well there's no reason why we should be going into a lockdown considering the health advice has always been about increasing vaccination rates so my community has stepped up um you know we've got nearly 80 of our residents that are now having their first vaccination nearly 40 that are fully vaccinated there is no logical reason why my residents can't_''_268.4 be going out and enjoying uh picnics like they are across sydney uh outside hot spot areas so it add these are the rules that are building resentment um and these rules are really uh unfair for communities um that are doing the right thing so the premier needs uh you know I reiterate the premier needs to give people confidence to show that the government has a plan uh and reward communities that are continually showing that they're doing the right thing all right we'll see how that meeting ends up john faker thanks for your time thanks lauren to speak to you again the wood man meeting with gladys burjicli in about 15 minutes time
G'day bird I'm just back at the rsl where we have our vaccination hub thanks to all the residents that are coming out and getting vaccinated and this vaccination up has really made a difference so I'm calling on the state government to provide a further extension because by the time we're finished here we will have over 3 000 of our residents that took the jab so well done build also really working hard over the last couple of weeks to get billwood removed as a hotspot area it makes no sense that we're still on the list with a handful of cases so I've been continuing to write to the premier and the health minister continue to follow our news for further updates well done again bill
G'day bird I've got some great news for you today we have been able to get an additional three days for our vaccination hub so a big thank you to nissa miles health and the rsl for coming on board and working with our council to secure this location for our residents also great job bill and a big thank you to our residents who have gone out and gotten vaccinated we're lifting our vaccination rates which is really important for us to lift our restrictions and get us out of this lockdown so well done build it again keep up the great work and we will get through this together
 trees play an essential role in improving our air quality provide shade create habitat for our native animals and keep our streets and parks looking beautiful to keep our community green we are planting more trees in our streets parks and natural open spaces which will help create an enjoyable place to live in with the planting of more trees we understand that from time to time the roots from trees and plants can cause blockages or damage to sewer pipes in this video I'll talk about some of the causes of pipe and drainage problems and who is responsible for the maintenance and repairs it's important to note that although the trees on council land belong to council property owners are responsible for any services needed that relate to their property as a property owner you are responsible for the maintenance and repairs of drainage pipes that service your property up to the sydney water main this includes pipes that run under the footpath nature strip and roads the age of the pipes can cause deterioration and subsidence which can cause cracks in the joints to nutrient water can leak into the soil and if tree roots come into contact with the moisture they will start to divide and expand rapidly it's often thought that tree roots go in search of water but that is not true tree roots take the opportunity of entering a pipe that has a fault it's rare for tree roots to crack or break a well-maintained drainage pipe to prevent blockages and damages to your pipes it is best to seek advice from a licensed plumber who will give you the correct advice to maintain your drainage line you

So on behalf of my ancestors descendants and elders and young ones most part both past and present and lastly brought me into the future in that sydney language I say where am I welcome everyone to the land obviously I know that my ancestors are looking after me and making sure that we've done everything correctly as a part of that oldest continuous culture on mother earth thanks to uncle les for his welcome to country and traditional smoking ceremony which is going to protect this great place um everything we've tried to accomplish here other than the actual building and the community spaces inside is to actually connect with our past and tying that in with our present but also really seeking out spaces that will help us grow as a community into the future and I think the three murals on hornsey lane they really represent what that space is so a credit to all the staff who have led through this project I've been here a number of time during the process of construction and whether it's been from tommaso to kimberley with some of the um things that you might think are simple like the gardening butcher which probably take a lot more time than the actual construction of the building thank you very much and I know you're as proud as this project as I am isn't just a library anymore it's our community hub it's our council home we have taken into consideration the different feedback that we had from our residents community groups our business groups and also our staff on the type of space they want to see so this space it's great it's it's about taking us into the future I can't wait for this space to expand and you might be saying but hang on mr mayor we've just finished the space what you talking about expanding well there's still a greater vision for this community hub to to bring in that square which will tie in the western side of our local government area to pretty much the east so we've got a vision to kick through this square which will go straight it will go through the proposed build place plaza development and then eventually kick through to build road and there are actually spaces that will then kick through build roads so you have squares that you'll be able to walk from conda street pretty much all the way to our elizabeth street car park just behind the courthouse and we want to make those spaces active we want to make those spaces full of color and we want to really celebrate the diversity of that space adding a new park to this space with an underground car park and a hopefully a sub-level of space which will have community spaces in there as well so you have 120 car spots some level of space whether it be an amphitheatre or some sporting spaces and then a park on top of that so well done um to all our city is changing but we need to ensure that we get great public spaces out of that most of the money that's come into this project which is 15 million dollars has come from our voluntary planning agreements that we town centre as well as a grant from the state library so thanks to the state library thanks again to the staff to the contractors the architects everyone that was involved in this project I hope you enjoy this space and now I'm going to officially declare the billwood council and library community hub open you
